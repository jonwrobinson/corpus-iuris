TITLE I.
CONCERNING THE TRANSPORTATION OF PUBLIC PROPERTY
BY SHIP-OWNERS OR SHIP-MASTERS, AND THE ABOLITION
OF THE TAX KNOWN AS LUSTRAL GOLD.

1 and 2. These Laws are not Authentic.

3. The Emperor Constantine and the Csesar Julian to Olybrius, Prefect of the
City.
No violence shall be employed against ship-masters engaged in the transport of
tributary grain, nor shall they be put to any annoyance
or trouble, but must enjoy perfect security while both coming and going, and
anyone who attempts to molest them shall be fined ten pounds of gold.
Given at Rome, on the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of Constantius,
Consul for the ninth time, and the Caesar Julian, Consul for the second time,
357.

4. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Eusebius, Prsetorian Prefect.
We have ascertained that certain ship-masters have made property collected by
way of tribute an object of commerce for their own benefit, and therefore We
decree that they must, within a year, turn over whatever they have received,
and take receipts for the same, showing the day of its delivery, which receipts
must be exhibited by them within another year to the persons by whom the
property was delivered for transportation.
Given at Milan, on the tenth of the Kalendsof January, during the third
Consulate of Arcadius and Honorius, 394.

5. The Same Emperors to Flavianus, Prefect of the City.
We wish those who have plundered ship-masters to make good the losses out of
their own property, and therefore, in order to prevent any act of this kind
from taking place hereafter, We decree that whoever is convicted of the robbery
of a ship-master shall be compelled to pay a penalty of fourfold the amount
taken.
Published at Rome, in the Apronian Forum, on the ninth of the Kalendsof
February, during the Consulate of Stilicho and Aurelian, 400.
6. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius.
As there was a scarcity of ships among the ship-masters of the provinces of the
East, and, on the pretext of obtaining vessels, search was made through the
adjoining islands and the opportunity for sailing lost, and, on account of
there being no means of transportation it was feared that the severity of the
authorities would be exerted, it was with reason that Your Highness called
together the Augustal Prefect and the Governor of the islands, together with
the commanders of the fleet of Alexandria and Carpathia, and other ship-
masters, in order that they might be held responsible for the transfer to the
warehouses of the Imperial Metropolis of the supplies of grain usually
transported by eastern ship-owners from the warehouses of Alexandria to the
Capital of the Empire; and in lieu of the small compensation paid for
transportation, immunity from payment of tribute or from the tax called
<f>i\iKovwas conferred upon the said ship-masters, in addition to the other
privileges which were granted during the consultation which took place.
Given on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of
Honorius, Consul for the eighth time, and Theodosius, Consul for the third
time, 409.
7. The Same Emperors to Anthemius, Prsetorian Prefect.
Anyone who, having undertaken the transportation of property belonging to the
government, abandons the direct route of navigation, and, following a different
course, turns aside and sells the property committed to his care, shall be
punished with death.
Given at Constantinople, on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof August, during the
Consulate of Honorius, Consul for the eighth time, and Theodosius, Consul for
the third time, 409.
8. The Same Emperors to Faustinus, Prsetorian Prefect.
Judges who permit loaded ships to remain in districts subject to their
jurisdiction, under pretext of winter, when the weather is favorable for
navigation, shall, with the citizens and the curiaof the place, be compelled to
pay the expenses incurred by the Governor out of their own property. Moreover,
the ship-masters shall suffer the penalty of deportation, if it should be
ascertained that they have committed any fraud.
Given at Ravenna, on the eighteenth of the Kalendsof September,
during the Consulate of Varana, 410.



TITLE II.
CONCERNING LAND AND ALL OTHER PROPERTY BELONGING TO SHIP-OWNERS.
1. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Aurelian, Prefect of Subsistence.
We order that even Our Imperial household shall be responsible ttoothose with
whom it has contracted obligations having reference to property liable in the
name of a ship-owner.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of Lupicinus
and Jovinus, 367.
2. The Same Emperors and Gratian to Achilo, Proconsul of Africa.
So far as property sold by ship-masters is concerned (as it is not right to
prevent anyone from selling or buying), the purchaser shall be responsible for
what is sold by the ship-master, in proportion to his share of the property
disposed of, for the liability attaches to the property, and not to the person
of the vendor. We do not direct that he shall become a ship-master who has
purchased anything from one, but that he shall be liable for whatever he
bought, in proportion to the
value of the same.
For not all that the ship-owner possessed, and a portion of which the trader
obtained, but only that portion which belonged to the shipowner in the
beginning shall be liable for the payment of this obligation, and the residue
of the property, which is not subject to it, shall remain free and exempt.
Again, where a house whose value consists in the beauty and ornamentation of
the city, rather than in the income obtained from it, is sold by a ship-master,
it is settled and it will be liable for this pay-
merit only to the extent of its actual worth in money. Where, however, the land
is of such limited extent that it cannot be subjected to such a charge, or
where there are buildings whose repairs or reconstruction are arduous and
difficult, or where houses are erected (as is frequently the case) merely for
adornment, We are unwilling that any such display of munificence which may
subsequently have taken place should be the subject of dishonorable competition
by bidders; but the former character of the land and the amount of the payment
should be taken into consideration, rather than the daily cultivation of the
soil, whose value is increased by the industry of an energetic man.
3. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Messala, Prsetorian Prefect.
Those who, by any title whatosever, obtain lands belonging to ship-owners, are
compelled to assume the burdens attaching to the same, in accordance with the
value of the property, as appraised in ancient times; and ship-owners are
notified not to think that they can take advantage of this law by voluntarily
disposing of their property through the transfer to persons who are insolvent.
An agreement of this kind, however, shall stand, so that if the land is
conveyed to someone who is insolvent, the vendors will be held liable, and the
Treasury can, first of all, have recourse to those who are solvent for any loss
which it may have sustained.
Given at Milan, on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate
of Theodore, Consul for the fifth time, 399.


TITLE III.
CONCERNING EXCUSES FOR SHIPS WHICH SHALL NOT BE
ACCEPTED.


1. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Longinianus, Prsetorian Prefect.
Many persons protect their ships under various pretexts, and, for the purpose
of preventing this kind of fraud, notice is hereby given that if anyone should
think that, by means of false ownership, he can evade the requirements of the
State, his vessel shall be confiscated to the Treasury. For while We do not
forbid private individuals to own ships, We do not permit them on this account
to be guilty of fraud, as everyone is bound to consult the public welfare when
necessity demands it, and transport the property of the government without
availing himself of any privilege enjoyed by persons of his social or official
station.
Given at Ravenna, on the third of the Idesof January, during the Consulate of
Arcadius, Consul for the seventh time, and Probus, 406.
2. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Florentius, Prse-torian Prefect.
We order that no ship which has the capacity of more than two thousand
modiibefore the happy embolashall be exempt from the
public service, or the transportation of property belonging to the government,
either by reason of some prerogative attaching to rank, or on account of
religion, or because of any personal privilege, not even if an Imperial
Rescript (whether it be an epistle or a pragmatic sanction) should be produced
in opposition to the provisions of this most salutary law.
We desire that the aforesaid rule shall be observed in every instance, so that,
generally speaking, when anything of this kind is brought forward contrary to
law or the public welfare, in any transaction whatsoever, it shall not be
valid. We shall punish any fraudulent attempt made to violate this law in any
way whatsoever by the confiscation of the ship for which exemption is claimed.
TITLE IV. No ADDITION SHALL BE MADE TO PUBLIC BURDENS.
1. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Rufinus, Prsetorian Prefect.
No one shall impose any private charge upon ship-masters who have already
assumed public burdens, nor shall those who have been employed for the
transport of grain be compelled, under any pretext, to assume other
liabilities; for the ship-master will not only be civilly responsible for any
expense incurred, as well as for the loss of his ship, but he will also be
subjected to severe public punishment.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifth of the Idesof January, during the
Consulate of Olybrius and Probinus, 385.



TITLE V. CONCERNING SHIPWRECKS.


1. The Emperor Constantine.
If a vessel is driven on land by shipwreck, or if it goes ashore at any time,
it shall belong to the owners, and My Treasury shall advance no claim to it-;
for what right has the Treasury to take advantage of the misfortunes of others,
so as to profit by such an unhappy occurrence ?
2. The Emperors Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian to Modestus, Prsetorian
Prefect.
Where a ship-master alleges that he has had a wreck, he must hasten to appear
before the judge of the province, who has jurisdiction, and prove the fact, by
witnesses in his presence. A report shall then be made to the eminent
Prefecture, so that the truth having been established within a year, the matter
may properly be disposed of. It has been decided that if, through negligence,
the term of a year should be permitted to elapse, any claims presented after
that time shall not be admitted as being worthless, and introduced too late.
Given on the Nonesof June, during the Consulate of Modestus and Arinthius, 372.
3. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to the Shipmasters of
Africa.
Whenever ships have been destroyed or sunk, an investigation shall be made by a
competent judge, and two or three sailors must be examined, but the others
should be released from any proceeding of this kind; for an expert questioner
can obtain abundant information from the number of sailors aforesaid. The
pilots, who have more knowledge, should be selected for this purpose; or if
they have lost their lives, inquiry should be made of others. Moreover, when
the violence of the storm has killed all the sailors, in order that the truth
may be ascertained, their children, or those of the pilots can, after having
been brought into court, be interrogated with reference to the death of those
whom the ship-master asserts to have perished. The time of an inquiry of this
kind shall run from the Kalendsof April, to the first of the Kalendsof October.
Given on the eighth of the Idesof February, during the Consulate of Gratian and
Theodosius, 380.
4. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Tati-anus, Prsetorian
Prefect.
Where property has been subjected to contribution and then lost in shipwreck,
We are unwilling that those by whom this was done shall be, in any way
molested, or held responsible by Us, whether they are senators or private
individuals.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof August, during the
Consulate of Tatianus and Symmachus, 391.
5. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to the Ship-masters of Africa.
With reference to wrecked ships, We decree that the cases shall be heard with
all diligence, and if anyone is convicted of having appropriated property under
such circumstances, the judge before whom this is proved shall have power to
fine, deport, and proscribe those who are guilty, in accordance with their
rank. If, however, he should neglect to hear the case within two years, and
this time has elapsed, he will be responsible, the ship-master must be
discharged on account of the fault of the judge, and the latter will be
compelled to pay the value of half of the cargo of the vessel, and his
subordinates shall pay the other half, on account of his failure to decide the
case within the time prescribed by law.
Given at Ravenna, on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate
of Honorius, Consul for the ninth time, and Theodosius, Consul for the fifth
time, 412.
6. The Same Emperors.
Where an investigation of a shipwreck is made in the usual way, and it is found
that the vessel was lost in a storm, you should not
grant release of liability for the cargo, but its value must be apportioned pro
rataamong the owners of the ship in a suitable manner.



TITLE VI.
CONCERNING MINERS, MINES, AND THE SUPERINTENDENTS OP THE LATTER.


1. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Cresconius, Count of the Mines.
After due deliberation, We have considered it proper to order that anyone who
wishes to engage in the business of mining shall, in addition to what he gains,
provide for the State by his own labor. Therefore) those who voluntarily pursue
this occupation must be compelled by Your Excellency to pay to the government
eight scruples to the ounce, which is called in Greek xpv<ra-w??s-Anything which
they may obtain over and above this amount shall preferably be sold to the
Treasury, and the proper price be paid for it out of the Treasury of Our
Largesses.
Given at Paris, on the fourth of the Idesof December, during the Consulate of
Valentinian and Valens, 365.
2. The Same Emperors to Germanianus, Count of the Imperial Largesses.
In estimating the weight of metals, the usual custom should be observed, that
is to say, fourteen ounces should be considered as making a pound.
Given at Rome, on the sixth of the Idesof January, during the Consulate of
Lupicinus and Jovian, 367.
3. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Florus, Praetorian
Prefect.
All persons engaged in mining on the lands of others shall pay one-tenth to the
Treasury, and one-tenth to the owner of the property, and will be entitled to
the remainder for themselves.
Given at Constantinople, on the fourth of the Kalendsof September, during the
Consulate of Antonius and Syagrius, 382.
4. The Same Emperors to Eusinius, Prastorian Prefect.
As the superintendents of mines in Macedonia, in that part of Dacia situated on
the Mediterranean, and in Mysia and Dardania, appointed by the decurions of
these provinces to regularly collect what is due to the government from the
mines, sometimes abandon their places through pretended fear of the enemy, they
shall be returned to the discharge of their duties, and none of them shall
hereafter be permitted to fill any other office before they have, with energy
and diligence, completed the term for which they were appointed to superintend
the mines.
5. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosii, and Arcadius to Romu-lus, Count of the
Imperial Largesses.
Miners pursuing their occupations both in the province of Pontus and in that of
Asia shall be compelled to pay seven scruples annually into the Treasury of the
Imperial Largesses for every man employed.
Given at Constantinople, on the eleventh of the Kalendsof March, during the
Consulate of Arcadius, Consul for the second time, and Rufinus, 392.
6. The Same Emperors to Paternus.
We have learned that certain persons, under the pretext of opening quarries,
have made extensive excavations, and by this means caused damage to the
foundations of buildings. In cases of this kind, no one shall be given
permission to make such excavations, even if marble is said to be situated
under the foundations of the buildings.
Given at Constantinople, on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof April, during the
Consulate of Theodosius, Consul for the third time, and Abundantius, 393.
7. The Emperor Theodosius to Maximin, Count of the Imperial Largesses.
Minors of either sex, who have left the country in which they were born and
emigrated to another, should undoubtedly, together with their offspring, be
returned without delay to the place of their birth, even though they may have
obtained employment in Our Imperial household. Moreover, they are hereby
notified that they can, in no way, prejudice the rights of the Treasury, even
if any one of them, who proved to be a minor, should have had his name
inscribed upon the register of the census.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifth of the Idesof July, during the Consulate
of Victor, 424.
TITLE VII.
CONCERNING DYERS OP PURPLE, INMATES AND SUPERINTENDENTS OF THE GYNECEUM,
MASTERS OF THE MINT, AND CARRIERS.
1. The Emperor Constantine to the Bithynians.
Masters of the mint should always retain their status, and shall not be
released therefrom by the privileges attaching to any dignity whatsoever.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of
Gallicanus and Bassus, 317.
2. The Same Emperor.
Persons employed in dyeing establishments, and the apartments of women where
the manufacture and dyeing of cloths for the use
of the palace are carried on, shall not endeavor to retain such places by
intrigue, for fear that the goods manufactured there may, by adulteration, be
rendered of inferior value, and if anyone should violate this law he shall be
put to death.
3. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to the Consular, Ger-manus.
Freeborn women, who marry the overseers of gyneceums,in violation of formal
warning given to them, and who prefer a disgraceful union of this kind to the
nobility of their race, shall be reduced to the condition of their husbands.
Given at Milan, on the fourth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of
Valentinian and Valens, 365.

Imperial Largesses.
Those who have been convicted of harboring any woman belonging to a
gyneceumshall be subjected to a fine of five pounds of gold.
Given at Cilicia, on the twelfth of the Kalendsof September, during the
Consulate of Modestus and Arintheus, 372.

Published at Carthage, on the third of the Kalendsof March, after the Consulate
of Auxonius and Olybrius, 380.
7. The Same Emperors to Hesperius, Prsetorian Prefect.
We decree that no woman of high rank shall degrade herself by a shameful union
with a man employed in the coinage of money. If anyone should violate this law,
and does not renounce the connexion which she has formed, but still adheres to
the union with the coiner, there is no doubt that she will prejudice both
herself and her children, and be reduced to the condition of her companion.
(1) If any woman who is the dependent or vassal of another, without the
knowledge of her master, or even with his knowledge, should unite herself with
a man engaged in the coinage of money, and her master, having been notified,
does not immediately separate these persons, and resume possession of his
vassal, he, having tacitly renounced control over her, is hereby notified that
he will afterwards have no right to claim her services.
(2) As We are unwilling for a woman of different status to be united with a
coiner of money, so We forbid the union of the daughter of a coiner and a man
of another condition.
Dated at Aquileia, on the day before the Idesof March, after the Consulate of
Auxonius and Olybrius, 380.
8. The Same Emperors to Trifolius, Count of the Imperial Largesses.
By the terms of this law, which is to be perpetual, We decree that carriers
shall not be permitted to abandon their employment, or surreptitiously obtain
another, before they have discharged the duties of the one to which they
belong.
Given at Heraclia, on the ninth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate
of Richomer and Clearchus, 384.
9. The Same Emperors to Principius, Prsetorian Prefect.
If anyone should be so bold as to make use of a ship destined for the
collection of shellfish used for dyeing the Imperial purple, he shall be
compelled to pay a fine of two pounds of gold.
Given at Aquileia, on the sixth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulship
of Arcadius and Bauto, 385.
10. The Emperors Arcadius, Honorius, and Theodosius to Pilo-metor, Count of the
Imperial Largesses.
We order that hereafter raw silk, as well as such as has been dyed, shall be
reserved for Our exclusive use, and that the officers of the Bureau of Imposts,
as well as the incumbents of any office whatsoever, shall be fined twenty
pounds of gold if they permit the present law to be rashly violated by anyone.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifth of the Kalendsof July, during the
Consulate of Arcadius, Consul for the sixth time, and Probus, 406.
11. The Emperor Theodosius and the Csesar Valentinian to Maxi-min, Count of the
Imperial Largesses.
Dyers of purple who, after having abandoned and repudiated the duties of their
own status, and alleged to have accepted honors and employments forbidden to
them, shall be returned to the requirements of their own trade and original
condition. Those, however, who, it is evident, have become possessed of the
property of persons restricted by their birth to certain occupations, shall be
compelled to return said property to its former owners, no matter under what
title they may have obtained possession of the same. If, however, those having
possession of such property choose to be subjected to the disabilities of a
condition inferior to their own, rather than to restore the property, they are
hereby notified that they will hereafter be considered members of the
profession of those whose property they have acquired, and they are also
notified that they will be held strictly accountable for
any balance due from said owners, without being allowed to offer any excuse
whatsoever.
Given at Constantinople, on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof November, during
the Consulate of Victor, 424.

those of the linen weavers, lympharii,masters of the mint, dyers of purple, or
any other associations connected with the Imperial Largesses, should hereafter
desire to retire from the body to which he belongs, he shall not readily be
released and another substituted in his place, but only such persons as you may
approve as suitable shall be accepted.
Moreover, he who, through Imperial favor, has been permitted to have his place
taken by another, shall entertain no doubt that he and his children, together
with all their property, will still remain connected with the body from which
they have been permitted to withdraw.
Given at Constantinople, on the seventh of the Kalendsof March, during the
Consulate of the Emperors Theodosius, Consul for the twelfth time, and
Valentinian, Consul for the second time, 426.
14. The Same Emperors.
Those who have been placed in charge of Our private wardrobe and treasury, the
chiefs of the weavers and dyers, and all other persons charged with duties of
this kind, shall not be permitted to perform them, or to have access to the
property of the Imperial Treasury, before furnishing proper security for the
administration of their offices; and they are notified that they cannot,
hereafter, ask to be excused from furnishing such security.
15. The Same Emperors.
Children, proved to have been descended from a father or mother who are
gatherers of the shellfish used for the Imperial purple, must entertain no

TITLE VIII.
CONCERNING CLOTHING COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF SILK AND GOLD, AND OP THE DYE OP THE
IMPERIAL PURPLE.
1. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Archelaus, Count of the Imperial
Largesses.
We prohibit men from making or weaving garments composed of silk and gold for
private use, as We order that they shall only be made in the gyneceums.
Adopted at Martianopolis, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof August, during the
Consulate of our Prince Valentinian and Victor, 369.
2. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Florus, Praetorian
Prefect.
No one shall have clothing woven of wool, linen, and gold, as this is one of
the Imperial prerogatives. Anyone who makes use of such forbidden garments, to
which he has no right, shall be severely punished.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Kalendsof April, during the
Consulate of Antonius and Syagrius, 382.
3. The Emperors Theodosius, Arcadius, and Honorius.
We do not permit wool to be dyed with any color resembling the Imperial purple,
nor do We permit silk to be dyed rose-color, and afterwards with another tint,
but there is no reason why white should not be dyed any color whatsoever. Those
who violate this law shall suffer the punishment of death.
4. The Emperor Theodosius to Maximin, Count of the Sacred Largesses.
Let all persons of either sex and of every rank, trade, profession, and
station, abstain from the possession of clothing expressly reserved for the
Emperor and his family, and let no one weave or make silk cloaks and tunics in
his own house. Everything dyed with the Imperial purple, without being mixed
with any other color, shall be removed from the building where this was done,
and all tunics and cloaks which are dyed with the Imperial purple shall be
surrendered. No threads dyed with Imperial purple shall hereafter be woven into
cloth, and all garments entirely composed of silk shall, in the future, be
delivered to Our Treasury; and let no one demand payment for the same, as
impunity from violated law will be sufficient compensation.
Again, in order that no one may subsequently incur the penalty of this New
Constitution, We decree that he shall be considered guilty of high treason.
Given at Constantinople, on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof February, during
the Consulate of Victor, 424.
5. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian.
We have again, by the provisions of a recent law, forbidden traffic in purple,

order that, at a certain time, there shall be sent
to the Phoenician manufacturers the seventh officer of the Bureau of Receipts,
the sixth of the Bureau of Imposts, the fifth of the Bureau of Archives, the
fourth of the Bureau of the Imperial Wardrobe, and in order that they may not
be guilty of fraud, and may exert proper diligence, We decree that they shall
be fined twenty pounds of gold iiffthey do not properly discharge the duties
required of them.
Given at Constantinople, on the eighth of the Idesof March, during the
Consulate of Isidore and Senator, 436.
TITLE IX.
CONCERNING MANUFACTURERS.
1. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Tati-anus, Prsetorian
Prefect.
We order that all manufacturers shall deliver the articles made by them, and
not pay money in their stead, and that the iron furnished shall be of good
quality, and readily melted, in order that there may be less opportunity for
fraud, and the public welfare be the better
provided for.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of
Theodosius, Consul for the second time, and Cynegius, 388.
2. The Emperors to Rufinus, Master of the Offices.
We order that the chief of the manufacturers shall, after the lapse of two
years of continuous service, be not only discharged, but also treated with
honor; and be included among the protectors of the guild of manufacturers, as
well as sent every two years for the purpose of congratulating the Emperor.
Given at Milan, on the eighth of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of
Valentinian, Consul for the fourth time, and Neotherius, 393.
3. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Osius, Master of the Offices.
Indelible marks, that is to say, well-known brands, should be placed upon the
arms of apprentices to manufacturers, so that in this way they may easily be
recognized, if they should attempt to conceal themselves, and that those who
are marked in this way, as well as their children, can unquestionably be
identified by their guild whenever they surreptitiously, for the purpose of
avoiding labor, have succeeded in obtaining admission to membership in any
other guild.
Given at Constantinople, on the eighteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the
Consulate of Honorius, Consul for the fourth time, and Eutychianus, 398.
4. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Anthemius, Prsetorian Prefect.
When anyone desires to be enrolled in the Organization of Manufacturers in the
city in which he was born, or in which he has fixed his domicile, after they
have been assembled, and before any docu-
ments are drawn up, he must prove that neither his grandfather nor his father
was a decurion, and that he owes nothing to the Order of the Decurionate, and
is under no liability to any citizen, and, after the proper formalities have
been complied with before the Governor of the province, or (if he should be
absent) before the defender of the city, the candidate shall be admitted into
the association which he has selected.
If, in violation of the provisions of this law, anyone should secretly obtain
admission to the guild of manufacturers, he is hereby notified that he shall be
returned to the order to which he belongs, and compelled to discharge his
duties to his country, and that no privilege of time, or previous service will
entitle him to exemption.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof June, during the
Consulate of Honorius, Consul for the ninth time, and Theodosius, 412.
5. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian.
It has been provided by law that artisans must confine themselves to their own
trades, and, together with their children, remain in the one to which they
belong, until their labors are ended by death.
Finally, any offence committed by one renders the entire number responsible,
which rule has been established to cause them to be more careful in the
selection of their members, and exercise supervision over their acts, since the
loss sustained by one is felt by all. Therefore, all of them constitute, as it
were, but a single body, and are compelled to answer for the delinquency of
one, when circumstances demand it.
6. The Emperors Leo and Anthemius to Eufirmius, Master of the Offices.
We order that those artisans engaged in manufactures for the Emperor, as well
as their wives and children, who are also said to be artisans, shall not be
required to answer in court, unless before the tribunal of Your Highness, to
whose jurisdiction they belong and under whose power they are. Nor shall they,
after their term of service has expired, under any circumstances, be liable to
civil or curial obligations, or be illegally molested by the illustrious
Governors of provinces or their subordinates.
7. The Emperor Anastasius to the Master of the Offices.
No member of the guild of manufacturers shall hereafter lease property, or
engage in the management or cultivation of land belonging to another; and any
owner who ventures to violate this law by knowingly entrusting his personal
effects or land to the administration of artisans shall lose it; and the
latter, after having undergone severe punishment and the confiscation of their
property, shall be sentenced to perpetual exile.
Every time that it may be necessary to require the transport of arms, Your
Highness shall notify the eminent Prefecture, and state
the quantity of arms, and the place from which they are to be transferred, in
order that the Prefect may immediately order the illustrious Governor of the
province to provide ships or vehicles out of those belonging to the public, for
the conveyance of said arms, in accordance with the notice served upon him by
Your Highness. If, after notice has thus been given by Your Highness to the
Prefecture as aforesaid, delay or negligence on the part of the authorities
should occur, and the transport of the arms should, for this reason, be
prevented, We order that the accountant at that time in office in the
Prefecture shall, with the other officials responsible for the delay, be
sentenced to a fine of fifty pounds of gold, and that the said amount of gold
shall be paid into the Treasury as soon as it is collected. In addition to
this, We subject the illustrious Governor of the province, as well as his
subordinates, to a fine of thirty pounds of gold, when, through their
connivance, the transport of arms was delayed.
TITLE X.
CONCERNING THE VALUE OP ANCIENT MONEY.
1. The Emperor Constantine.
We order that the solidicoined by former Emperors shall be paid and accepted by
purchasers and vendors, and that no dispute shall arise with reference to them,
provided they are of the proper weight, and genuine, and all persons are hereby
notified that if they violate this law they will be subjected to severe
punishment.
2. The Same Emperor.
When the value of a solidusis depreciated, it is necessary for all articles
purchased with it to be diminished in the same proportion.
3. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosii^.
You must notify all persons by the proposed Edict that an uniform value of all
bryzat solidiwill be established, and that anyone who, through the blindness of
avarice, either disobeys Our orders or fraudulently attempts to change the
appearance of these coins, will be punished by death.
TITLE XI.
No ONE SHALL BE PERMITTED TO ADORN THE BRIDLES.OR
SADDLES OF THEIR HORSES OR THEIR OWN BELTS WITH
PEARLS, EMERALDS, OR HYACINTHS, AND CONCERNING THE
ARTIFICERS OF THE PALACE.
1. The Emperor Justinian.
No one shall hereafter be permitted to decorate the bridles and saddles of his
horses, or his own belts with pearls, emeralds, or hyacinths, or to insert them
therein. We, however, permit them to adorn the bridles and saddles of their
horses, and their own belts with other
jewels. We order that, hereafter, all jewels of every description shall be
removed from cucurnii,and that buckles which are valuable only for the gold of
which they are composed, and their workmanship, shall be used on military
cloaks.
Moreover, if anyone should violate this law, he is hereby notified that he will
immediately be fined fifty pounds of gold. Again, no private person shall be
permitted to make anything out of gold and jewels, which is reserved for
Imperial use and adornment (with the exception of ornaments usually worn by
women, and the rings of both sexes), and no one shall be allowed to manufacture
anything of this kind under the color or pretext of making a present of the
same to the Emperor, for he does not expect it, nor does the reverence due to
royalty require such donations by private individuals.
If anyone should, hereafter, violate any of the provisions of this law, and be
so bold as to fabricate any ornaments decorated with gold and jewels which are
exclusively destined for the use of the Emperor, with a view to their being
offered to him, he is hereby notified that he will be sentenced to pay a fine
of a hundred pounds of gold, and also suffer capital punishment.
Imperial ornaments must be made in the palace, by the artificers attached to
the same, and not indiscriminately in private residences or workshops.
Therefore, We order that this offence shall be punished with exemplary
severity, in order that private persons may not rashly venture to make what is
solely reserved for the splendor and adornment of the sovereign. If anyone
should commit an act in violation of this law, We order that the fine above
mentioned shall be collected by the officers of the palace, and paid into the
Treasury of the Imperial Largesses.
TITLE XII. CONCERNING MARINES.
1. The Emperors Valentinicm and Valens to Auxonius, Prsetorian Prefect.
We desire the Seleucian fleet, as well as all the others, to be subject to the
orders of the office which is dependent upon Your Excellency, so that the
number of marines may be made up from the volunteers or supernumeraries of
other fleets, and We direct that of Seleucia to be placed .at the disposition
of the Count of the East, for the purpose of clearing the seas of pirates, and
for any other necessary service.
TITLE XIII. CONCERNING THE DECURIALS OF THE CITY OP ROME.
1. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Tri-folius, Prietorian
Prefect.
When anyone thinks that a decurial should be deprived of privileges by process
of law, he is notified that application must be made to the judge of the curia.
Given at Milan, on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof February, during the
Consulate of Timasius and Promotus, 389.
2. The Emperors Arcadius, Honorius, and Theodosius to Exuper-antius, Julius and
other Decurials.
We, by Our authority, confirm the laws relating to decurials enacted by former
Emperors, as well as by Our Divine Father. Therefore, We desire all judges to
be informed that no one can, with impunity, attempt to subject a member of this
body to any corporeal penalty, or venture to deprive him of any of the
privileges which have been legally conferred upon him, for We wish this
association to retain all its ancient privileges.
Given at Rome, on the eighth of the Idesof July, during the Consulate of
Honorius, Consul for the sixth time, and Aristenetus, 404.
TITLE XIV.
CONCERNING THE PRIVILEGES ENJOYED BY MEMBERS OP CORPORATE BODIES OF THE CITY OF
ROME.
1. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Alypius, Prefect of
the City.
No one shall be permitted, or have the right to impose any new burden upon the
inhabitants of the City of Rome, but, for the honor of the Eternal City, We
order that the privileges of the members of its bodies corporate shall remain
intact. The members of such bodies of the City of Rome who have established
homes in foreign countries, shall be compelled by the Governors of the
provinces to return, in order that they may discharge the duties which, from
ancient times, have been formally imposed upon them.
TITLE XXVV..CONCERNING BAKERS.
1. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius.
Any slave of the Superintendent of the Public Warehouses, who either through
intrigue, favor, the use of money, or by any other means, may hereafter obtain
a dignity or an office, shall be deprived of what he acquired in violation of
Our order, and, having been fined twenty pounds of gold, shall be returned to
the body to which he formerly belonged.
Every special privilege which, under any circumstances, has been obtained
contrary to this law, is hereby absolutely annulled.
TITLE XVI.
CONCERNING THE PORK-BUTCHEKS, WINE-MEKCHANTS, AND OTHER CORPORATIONS.
1. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Albinus, Prefect of
the City.
As dealers in hogs in the Eternal City are engaged in an occupation
advantageous to the Roman people, they shall forever be exempt from the
performance of ignoble services.
Given at Rome, on the eighth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate
of Timasius and Promotus, 389.
2. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius.
Any member of the corporation of pork butchers, who appears in court either as
plaintiff or defendant, will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Urban
Prefect.
Given at Rome, on the eighteenth of the Kalendsof February, during the
Consulate of Bassus and Philip, 408.
TITLE XVII.
CONCERNING MEMBERS OP CORPORATIONS AND MONEY BROKERS.
1. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Cyrus, Prefect of the City.
When any persons, under the pretext of being deans or members of corporate
bodies, do not discharge the duties of the same, or attempt to evade other
obligations, We think that their fraudulent acts should be opposed, lest
someone, on the ground of already having one employment, may claim exemption
from the burdens of another, and to prevent the functions of bankers or brokers
from being avoided by those who have only the titles of members of corporate
bodies, or deans. Therefore, if one of such persons should call himself a
member of a corporate body, or a dean, while he is only such in name, he is
hereby notified that another who is capable of the discharge of the duties
aforesaid shall be subrogated, in his place, as in the subrogation of the
persons above mentioned, or that of those who are removed by death, dependent
always upon the consent of the superior officer of the individual subrogated.
(1) So far as the supernumeraries who are enrolled in such bodies are
concerned, none of them can be excused on the ground of patronage, or by virtue
of any other privilege, for this is Our decree, and it is the duty of Your
Highness and your office to diligently see that it is obeyed. We order that
this shall apply equally to all persons, so that no one attached to Our palace,
as well as those belonging to the churches, may succeed in being excused on
account of any favor or prerogative whatever.
But in order that We may not appear to have promulgated this rule solely with
reference to those actually employed, We direct it to
be stated and published that, where any transfer is made from the provinces by
means of a petition of the members of a corporation, this shall be done under
the terms of a former constitution; that is to say, the rule which was laid
down in the first place shall subsequently be observed without any innovation.
TITLE XVIII.
CONCERNING LIBERAL STUDIES IN THE CITIES OP ROME AND CONSTANTINOPLE.
1. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian, to the Prefect of the City.
We order that all those who, having illegally assumed the title of professor,
are accustomed to teach their pupils, collected together from all parts of the
world, and assembled in public places, or in cells, shall not continue to
practice this vulgar ostentation; and if anyone should attempt to do so, after
We have prohibited and condemned it by the promulgation of the present law, he
shall not only be branded with the infamy which he deserves, but shall also be
expelled from the city where he unlawfully pursues his calling.
We do not, however, apply this prohibition to such as are accustomed to impart
instruction privately, in the homes of their scholars, where they only occupy
themselves with the latter, and teach them in their own houses; but where they
are among those who have been appointed lecturers of the Capitol, they are
hereby notified that they are forbidden, under all circumstances, to give
lessons in the homes of their pupils, and they are warned that if they are
convicted of having violated this law they will be absolutely deprived of the
privileges by virtue of which ;they have been authorized to only impart
instruction in the Capitol. Therefore they shall have the special right to give
instruction, in the first place, in those branches of knowledge which the
teaching of Roman eloquence approves; that is to say, the professors of oratory
shall be three in number, and there shall be four professors of grammar, and
also among those who are known to excel in serious declamation, five sophists
and ten rhetoricians shall be appointed.
But as We do not desire youths only to receive instruction in these arts, We
have deemed it proper to associate with the professors above enumerated others
of more profound learning and scientific attainments. Hence, We wish one who is
competent to explain the secrets of philosophy, and two versed in jurisprudence
and the laws to be joined with them.
Your Highness shall see that special places are assigned to each of the above-
mentioned instructors, so that neither the scholars nor the teachers may
interrupt one another, and no confusion of tongues or of voices may distract
the ears or minds of any of them from the study of letters.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Kalendsof March, during the
Consulate of Theodosius, Consul for the eleventh time, and Valentinian, 425.
TITLE XIX.
CONCERNING THE VEHICLES OP PERSONS INVESTED WITH
HONORS.
1. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Ne-bridius, Prefect of

always be entitled to make use of vehicles suitable to their rank, that is to
say, carriages, in this Imperial City.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Kalendsof February, during the
Consulate of Our Prince Honorius, and Evodius, 386.

Italy, but also those of ancient Rome.
TITLE XXI. CONCERNING THE METROPOLIS OF BERYTUS.
1. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Hormisdas, Prss-torian Prefect.
We decree that the City of Berytus, already renowned for its admirable
qualities, shall, for good and sufficient reasons, be adorned with the title
and dignity of a metropolis, and therefore it is hereby constituted a
metropolitan city. Tyre shall lose none of its rights, but shall remain the
capital of the province, through the favor granted by Our ancestors. Berytus
shall become a metropolis by our own authority, and both cities shall enjoy the
same privileges.
TITLE XXII.
CONCERNING THE CONTRIBUTION OF GRAIN MADE TO THE CITY OF ROME.
1. The Emperors Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian to Julianus, Prefect of
Subsistence.
Masters of ships must swear before Governors or magistrates that the grain
which they have received is of good quality, and the official
before whom this oath is taken must satisfy himself by actual inspection that
none of it is spoiled. The Prefect of Subsistence is ordered to see that this
is done at the time when the grain is brought to the port of the Imperial City.
Given on the eighteenth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Gratian
and Dagalaifus, 366.
2. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to the Senate.
Where immunity from the delivery of wheat or barley to the City is granted, it
will be void, as rescripts specially issued contrary to the public welfare are
of no force or effect.
Given at Milan, on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate
of Csesarius and Atticus, 397.
3. The Same Emperors to Messala, Prsetorian Prefect.
We shall not, hereafter, permit anyone to petition for exemption from sending
provisions to the City of Rome, nor shall We suffer any rescripts, which may
have been obtained in any way for that purpose, to be considered valid.
We decree that those who violate this law shall be liable to a penalty of
double damages, and any vicegerents or other magistrates who may, hereafter, be
convicted of the misappropriation of grain destined for the city shall suffer
the penalty of deportation, and their principal subordinates be put to death.
Given on the fourth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of Theodore,
Consul for the fifth time, 399.
TITLE XXIII.
CONCERNING GRAIN DESTINED FOR THE CITY OF CONSTANTINOPLE.
1. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Ursus, Prefect of the City.
No one, not even a member of the Imperial household, shall be furnished with
grain from the public warehouses for the purpose ol subsistence; but the entire
amount shall be delivered to slaves, and be baked into bread for distribution
among the houses. For it is in this way that the privileges granted by the
Emperor Constantine ol glorious memory, as well as by My grandfather the
Emperor Theodosius, should be observed; for want will increase, if gram given
lor the purpose of subsistence is known to have been applied to other uses, and
the people will be compelled to purchase for themselves what they otherwise
would have been able to sell to others.
Given at Constantinople, on the tenth of the Kalendsof August, during the
Consulate of Theodore, Consul for the seventh time, and Palladtus, 416.
2. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Leontius, Prefect of the City.
The sum set apart for the purchase of grain shall remain the same forever, nor
shall any Prefect of the City, after his administration is terminated, be
permitted to diminish the said sum, or convert it to other uses, but a written
statement shall be filed, setting forth the amount furnished bakers, as well as
the quantity of bread to be delivered by them without their being subjected to
extortion.
We order that anyone who dares to violate this law by fraudulently
appropriating any of said grain shall restore double the amount, and any profit
which may be obtained by way of interest shall be added to the principal, and
be classed as such, to be expended in the purchase of grain. The provisions of
this law shall be inscribed upon tables of brass.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifth of the Kalendsof December, during the
Consulate of Ariobindus and Aspar, 434.
TITLE XXIV. CONCERNING CIVIL CONTRIBUTIONS OF GKAIN.
1. The Emperors Theodosius, Arcadius, and Honorius to Proculus, Prefect of the
City.
It is perfectly clear that, by virtue of the privilege granted by the Divine
Constantine, contributions of grain for public subsistence should be made, not
so much on account of rank, as because of the merits of individuals, and
therefore none of such persons shall have the right, as a member of a
privileged class, to claim any of such contributions. Where, however, they have
been bestowed on account of personal merit, they shall be valid; so that where
anyone has transferred the privilege of obtaining subsistence either to his own
heirs by right of blood, or to strangers by sale, the transaction shall stand,
whether the title is based upon inheritance or alienation.
Given at Constantinople, on the seventh of the Kalendsof July, during the
Consulate of Arcadius, Consul for the second time, and Rufinus, 392.
2. The Emperor Martian.
We grant, by Our liberality, in addition to the usual allowance, a donation of
a hundred and twenty-five measures of wheat out of the grain stored in the
public warehouses of this city, for every day of the present sixth indiction,
dating from the first of the Kalendsof January. And We order that instructions
to this effect shall be sent to the Sublime Prefecture of the East, in order
that it may be informed of the amount of Our donation and immediately comply
with Our commands. We direct this apportionment always to be granted to Our
subjects hereafter, and that this law shall be perpetually valid.


TITLE XXV. CONCERNING STURDY BEGGARS.
1. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Severus, Prefect of the
City.
All those who adopt the uncertain calling of public beggars shall be examined
and their physical condition and age be ascertained, and if they have been
reduced to this state through idleness, and not by disease, those of them who
are slaves shall become the property of the person who detected them. Where,
however, they are free by birth, they shall be subjected as vassals to whoever
has exposed them and proved their imposture. If they are fugitives, or others
have advised them to adopt the profession of beggars, the rights of action of
their masters shall remain unimpaired.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Antonius
and Syagrius, 382.


TITLE XXVI. CONCERNING BOATS PLYING ON THE TIBER.
1. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Symmachus, Prefect of the City.
Anyone who is shown to have a vessel for navigation on the Tiber shall be
subjected to the burdens imposed by the State. Therefore, any vessel found upon
the Tiber will be liable to the proper and ordinary services exacted by the
government, and no rank or privilege will avail to obtain exemption from this
public requirement.
Given on the eighth of the Idesof October, during the Consulate of the Divine
Jovian, and Varronian, 364.
TITLE XXVII.
CONCERNING GRAIN DESTINED FOR THE CITY OF ALEXANDRIA.
1. The Emperors Honorms and Theodosius to Anthemius, Prse-torian Prefect.
In estimating the amount of grain which should be transported to the City of
Alexandria, We confirm the provisions made by Your Highness concerning the
duties of crithologuesand zygostases,and the preservation of the property
belonging to masters of vessels. We order that decurions shall be deprived of
the opportunity for peculation, and that they shall be excluded from the
exercise of these functions, which shall be discharged by officials whose
appointment and capacity have been approved by you.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifth of the Kalendsof February, during the
Consulate of Honorius, Consul for the ninth time, and Theodosius, 412.
2. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Isidore, Prseto-rian Prefect.
We decree that a hundred and ten measures of grain shall be added to the daily
apportionment of the City of Alexandria, and that no one shall be deprived of
the amount which he has received up to the present time. We also decree that
what has previously been distributed under the name of perissochoregiashall
hereafter be designated as alms bestowed in the name of the Emperor.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Nonesof June, during the
Consulate of Isidore and Senator, 436.
TITLE XXVIII. CONCERNING THE PRIMATES OF THE CITY OP ALEXANDRIA.
1. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Isidore, Praetorian Prefect.
We release the corporate bodies of the City of Alexandria from the duty of
taking care of the river, and, in accordance with the tenor of your
regulations, decree that four hundred solidishall be set aside annually for
this purpose from the tax imposed upon the said city, which has been collected
in different ways from ships plying on the Nile.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Nonesof July, during the
Consulate of Isidore and Senator, 436.
TITLE XXIX. CONCERNING THE RIGHTS OF THE STATE.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Dionysius.
It has been decided that if any judgment should be rendered against the State,
in a case in which no defence was made, and defenders were not, nor should have
been appointed, no prejudice will result, so far as any actions to which the
State may be entitled are concerned.
2. The Same Emperor to Phorodius and Others.
Inquiry should be made of the judge having jurisdiction whether the State, to
whose place you have succeeded, for the reason that you allege that you have
satisfied the debt due to it, still retains the right of hypothecation to the
land in question. If it did not acquire that right through some special
provision made for the purpose, and this was not expressly stated in the
obligation, its case should not be distinguished from that of other creditors
who have the right of personal action.
3. The Emperor Alexander to Salvinius.
In extraordinary proceedings, it is customary for relief to be granted to the
State in the same way as to a female minor.
4. The Emperor Diocletian and Maximian to Urbanus.
If, in conformity to custom, the city you have mentioned sold the land occupied
by ruined buildings, the Governor of the province will permit nothing to be
done which is contrary to this practice.
TITLE XXX. CONCERNING THE ADMINISTRATION OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS.
1. The Emperor Gordian.
It is perfectly evident that the possessor of land under emphyteusis cannot be
deprived of the same without his consent, if the rent is regularly paid at the
time when it is due.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars.
You are aware that proceedings for the collection of damages should be
instituted against those who administer the affairs of the State, and are
required by the duties of their office to accept a trust left under a
condition, but have failed to discharge their duties in this respect.
TITLE XXXI.
CONCERNING THE SALE OF PROPERTY BELONGING TO THE
STATE.
1. The Emperor Alexander.
If you purchased land sold by the government unconditionally, and the sale has
been perfected, you need be under no apprehension that you can be deprived of
the ownership of the same by the subsequent offer of a higher price, provided
the time designated for such an offer to the Treasury has expired, unless the
city in question is, under such circumstances, controlled by a local custom.
2. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus.
Although a larger sum appears to have been offered as rent for the public land
in question, still the lease should not be declared void under the pretext of
this increase, especially when you state that a considerable time has elapsed
since the contract was made.
3. The Emperor Leo.
Where a house acquired through an inheritance, a legacy, a trust, or a
donation, or any supply of grain, or any buildings, or slaves come within the
jurisdiction of this renowned Capital, or of any other city of the Empire, it
shall be lawful for the municipality entitled to said property to enter into a
contract of sale to its own advantage, and the highest price possible having
been obtained at said sale, the proceeds shall be expended for the repair or
construction of public edifices.
We, intending diligently to provide for the interests of cities, and to prevent
persons from doing anything to their disadvantage, and
desiring such sales to proceed without the commission of fraud, corrupt
bargaining, or connivance of any description, do hereby decree that if anyone
should hereafter sell to this glorious City a house, civil supplies, or any
buildings or slaves whatsoever belonging to others, this shall not be done
unless by the authority of the Emperor.
Moreover, in the provinces, all, or a majority of the decurions, or of the
officials, or the owners of land in the city, to whom the property aforesaid
belongs, shall be present; and We order that after the Imperial document
authorizing the sale has been produced, each one of them shall give his opinion
as to what he thinks to be beneficial to his country, so that, finally, by
reading the decree in the presence of the proper authorities, the purchaser may
obtain a good title.
We decree that contracts of sale made in this manner, whether they are
completed at the time, or are perfected subsequently, shall be valid.
TITLE XXXII.
CONCERNING THE DEBTORS OP CITIES.
1. The Emperor Antoninus.
It has been established by My Constitutions, as well as by those of the Divine
Emperors, My predecessors, that a debtor to the government cannot be invested
with any official honor before he has discharged his indebtedness.
2. The Emperor Constantine to Verinus.
You should see that the funds of cities are loaned to persons who are solvent,
or whose heirs retain the estates of their fathers intact, provided they pay
the interest annually at the very time when it is due, as it is advantageous to
the State to have debtors who are solvent, and it is beneficial to the latter
that the amount of their indebtedness should not be increased. And, for the
reason that it is wrong for losses to be sustained by cities, through the
alienations of corporate bodies indebted to them, it has been decided that if
any debtor of a city should give away, sell, or otherwise dispose of to another
any part of the property of which he was possessed at the time when he borrowed
the public money, the nature of the property alienated and the entire fortune
of the debtor, which he possessed at the time that the money was lent to him,
being taken into consideration, the principal and interest of the debt can be
collected from him who obtained anything from the estate of the debtor in
proportion to what he received.
Therefore, whenever the estate of such a debtor is found to be insolvent, and a
claim is held against it by any city, the judge must use all diligence and
exert every effort to ascertain to whom the property of the debtor has been
transferred, so that each of the parties, after an equitable estimate has been
made, can be sued in proportion to the amount of the property of which he has
possession, and he will be entitled to a personal action against the debtor
aforesaid, who has been released from liability, by the payments which have
been made.
The person to whom the greater portion of his property is proved to have been
transferred by the debtor will have the right to demand the transfer of the
remainder, in order that, by so doing, he may become
solvent.
It is clear that if any debtor to the city should surrender his property to Our
Treasury, those who purchase it from the Treasury cannot, in accordance with
the ancient law and the Imperial Rescripts and Constitutions, be compelled to
suffer any annoyance. But if the debtor should not do this, or if he has
squandered all his property, so that no one can have possession of any of it,
the loss of the debt must then be sustained by the government; and therefore
the authorities of cities should be careful to lend their money to persons who
are solvent, or are the owners of rustic estates.
Published on the third of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of
Volusianus and Annianus, 314.
TITLE XXXIII.
CONCERNING THE LIABILITY OP THOSE WHO MAKE APPOINTMENTS.
1. The Emperor Gordian.
Although you did not require those who were appointed magistrates by you and
your colleague to furnish sureties, still, if they were solvent at the time
when they relinquished the honor of the magistracy, they did not, for that
reason, render you liable for any accidental circumstance by which the value of
their estates was reduced, as those who could have sued them in the public
name, and neglected to do so at the time when they retired from office, must
only blame themselves, and make good the loss sustained by the State if it
occurred through their fault.
2. The Emperor Philip and the Csesar Philip.If the successor of your successor
did not appoint a solvent magistrate in his place, the responsibility for his
administration can, by no means, attach to you personally; for one is only
compelled to assume responsibility for the successor whom he himself appointed,
and the power of the law does not extend to the appointment of one who, in
his turn, was appointed by another.
TITLE XXXIV.
CONCERNING THE LIABILITY OF THOSE WHO BECOME SURETIES FOR MAGISTRATES.
1. The Emperor Antoninus.
It has been decided by Me, as well as by My Father, the Divine Severus, that
the sureties of magistrates are only responsible for the administration of
those for whom they become liable, so far as matters
pertaining to the management of their office are concerned, and not for any
penalties which they may have incurred through negligence or crime.
TITLE XXXXXXVV..IN WHAT ORDER PERSONS MUST BE SUED.
1. The Emperor Antoninus.
Although the care of money belonging to a city may have been committed to two
persons, still, each of them is not liable to it merely for the portion which
he received, but in full. Moreover, when the State demands indemnity, the
property of him who transacted the business shall first be taken, and then (if
it is not sufficient to satisfy the claim) recourse must be had to his
colleague.
Although you are the heirs of one of the city officials, it is not reasonable
that you should be liable where, after the death of your principal, any fraud
or negligence has been committed by his colleagues.
2. The Emperor Gordian.
Whenever an official duty is imposed upon two persons, not separately but
jointly, and in such a way that each of them is considered responsible in full,
recourse cannot, under any law, be had to the person who made the appointment,
before the pecuniary resources of both of those who administered the office are
formally ascertained to have been exhausted.
Where, however, they were appointed to administer different branches of the
same employment, each should be held liable for that part of the office of
which he had charge; and the same rule applies to their sureties. But when
indemnity cannot be obtained from them, then recourse should be had to him who
appointed them, and if he should prove unable to discharge the indebtedness,
the Governor will not be ignorant of the fact that each of the officials is
liable for the acts of the other.
3. The Same Emperor.
If you have been created duumvirs, under the express condition that you should
be equally responsible for one another, there can be no doubt that you are each
liable for the other's acts, as it has been established that in case of the
appointment of magistrates, recourse should first be had to those who made the
appointment. And you understand that this rule must also be observed where We,
Ourselves, are personally interested.
4. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian.
As you allege that you and your colleague, while in office, lent the public
money at interest, and some of the claims cannot be collected from certain
debtors to the State, and as you are ready to make good the loss growing out of
any transaction in which you alone were concerned, the result will be that if
the administrations of you and your
colleague were distinct, recourse can be had to the successors of the latter,
or to the persons now in possession of his property. And if the State should
not be entirely indemnified, those who appointed him can be sued, and finally
if anything should remain unpaid by your colleague, you will be responsible for
negligence, since it has been decided that those who first made the nomination
are liable as sureties.
TITLE XXXVI.
No FREEMAN CAN BE COMPELLED TO PERFORM THE FUNCTIONS OF A MUNICIPAL SERVANT.
1. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus.
If, as you allege, you obtained your freedom by a decree of the decurionate,
you should not be obliged to serve the city against your consent, and the
municipal curator will remember this fact, especially as slaves are required to
perform this duty.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian.
If you, being freeborn, should be compelled by the city to discharge the duty
of a servant, you can invoke the aid of the Governor and the protection of the
law, as far as custom authorizes this to be done.
TITLE XXXVII.
THE EXPENSES OF THE OFFICE TO WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN APPOINTED MUST BE BORNE BY
ALL THE INCUMBENTS OF SAID OFFICE.
1. The Emperor Maximian.
As you state that you, with others, have been appointed to administer the
office of Superintendent of Couriers, and that you alone have discharged the
duties of the same, having been deserted by your colleagues; any expense which
you may have incurred should, by a decree of the Governor, be divided
proportionately among all who are required to share in the administration of
the office. He will not be ignorant of your liability to public censure, if he
should ascertain that you, also, have been derelict in the performance of your
duty.
TITLE XXXVIII.
CONCERNING THOSE AGAINST WHOM LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
ARE INSTITUTED ON ACCOUNT OF THE OFFICE WHICH
THEY HAVE ADMINISTERED.
1. The Emperor Antoninus.
As the money belonging to the city, which was lent at interest, was not lost
through your fault, it is sufficient for you to be responsible for the
principal, and not for the interest.
TITLE XXXXXXIIXX..
CONCERNING THE PAYMENTS AND RELEASES OP DEBTORS TO THE STATE.
1. The Emperor Alexander to the Quatuorvirs and Decurions of the Fabretanians.
Receipts given by public slaves only release debtors from liability when they
are countersigned by the treasurer, or are approved by the authority of those
having the right to make the collections.
Moreover, he who is said to have made payment, and can produce the receipt of
the person to whom the money was given, is only considered to have a good
defence, if he is able to show that what he paid was placed in the Treasury of
the City. If it should be proved that your curator, assisted by the fraud of
the slave, intercepted any money paid by the debtors, the slave shall be
compelled to refund the amount lacking out of his own peculium.
TITLE XL. CONCERNING EXHIBITIONS, ACTORS, AND PROCURERS.
1. The Emperor Constantine.
We do not discourage public diversions, but, on the other hand, exhort citizens
to re-establish the exhibitions of strength and skill in the arena. And,
besides, as officials desire to render themselves popular by considering the
tastes and pleasures of the people, We the more readily permit them to do so,
provided they bear the expense.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Valens, Consul
for the fifth time, and Valentinian, 376.
2. The Emperors Oration, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Valerian, Prefect of
Illyria.
Your Highness should be aware that those persons who occupy themselves in
raising disturbances should be subjected to no other punishment but that of
engaging in combats in the circus.
Given on the eighth of the Idesof May, during the Consulate of Eucherius and
Syagrius, 381.
3. The Same Emperors to Valerian, Prefect of the City.
Anyone who uses for his private profit or convenience the horses which We,
Ourselves, or the ordinary consuls, have set apart for the public races, shall
be fined one pound of gold.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Eucherius and
Syagrius, 381.
4. The Emperors Theodosius, Arcadius, and Honorius to Rufinus, Prsetorian
Prefect.
If the portrait of a buffoon in short garments, or one of a charioteer with
wrinkled breast, or of a vile actor, should be placed in the
public porticoes, or anywhere in the city in which Our statues are usually
erected, it shall immediately be removed; nor shall it, hereafter, ever be
lawful for the representations of such degraded persons to be exhibited in
respectable places. We do not, however, forbid such pictures to be set up at
the entrance of the theatre or circus.
Given at Heraclea, on the third of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of
Arcadius, Consul for the third time, and Honorius, Consul for the second time,
396,
5. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Anthemius, Prsetorian Prefect.
No person in authority shall permit chariot-horses, charioteers, wild animals,
actors, or citizens to be conducted from one city to another, or from one
province to another, lest, while they are intem-perately soliciting popular
applause, they may interfere with the transaction of public business, and
interrupt the celebration of public festivals in the towns; and anyone who
fails to obey this regulation will be liable to the penalty imposed upon
violators of the law.
Given at Constantinople, on the eighth of the Idesof August, during the
Consulate of Honorius, Consul for the eighth time, and Theodosius, Consul for
the third time, 409.
6. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Florentius, Prsetorian Prefect.
We do not suffer either fathers or masters who, acting as procurers, impose
upon their daughters or female slaves the necessity of prostituting themselves,
to enjoy the right of ownership of property, or to claim immunity for such a
crime. It is therefore decided that, as the result of Our indignation, they
shall not possess any authority over their daughters or slaves, and that
nothing can be acquired for them by their instrumentality; and any slaves and
daughters, whom poverty has reduced to such an humble condition, shall be
permitted to implore the aid of bishops, judges, and defenders of the city, if
they desire to do so, in order to be released from the necessity of pursuing
this
wretched calling.
If their procurers aforesaid should think that they have the right to compel or
require them, against their will, to continue in their disgraceful occupation,
they shall not only lose the power which they had over them, but their property
shall be confiscated, and they shall be sentenced to the public mines.
This penalty is less severe than that imposed where a woman is forced by a
procurer to indulge in promiscuous sexual intercourse without her consent.
Given on the eleventh of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate
of Felix and Taurus, 428.
TITLE XLI. CONCERNING THE EXPENSES OF GAMES.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian.
As you say that the Governor of the province has applied the funds which were
intended for public exhibitions to the repair of the walls of the city, what
has been done for the general welfare cannot be revoked by Us, but the regular
performances of the arena shall take place in accordance with ancient custom,
after the repairs of the walls have been completed. For in this way, by
strengthening the walls, provision is made for the defence of the city, and
those matters which have reference to the public safety having been
accomplished, the games can be celebrated afterwards.
TITLE XLII. CONCERNING AQUEDUCTS.
1. The Emperor Constantine to the Consular, Maximilian.
We desire that the owners of land through which canals pass shall be exempt
from extraordinary charges, in order that their labors may keep the aqueduct
clear of filth of every description, and no other requirement shall be imposed
on the possessors of said land to prevent them from occupying themselves with
other matters, and taking care to keep the channels of the aqueduct in good
condition. If they should fail to do this, they shall be punished with the loss
of their property, for the Treasury will obtain the land of him through whose
negligence the aqueduct became obstructed.
Moreover, all such persons are hereby notified to plant trees at intervals of
fifteen feet on both sides of the aqueduct traversing their premises; and it
shall be the duty of the judge to see that these trees are cut down, if at any
time they should sprout, to prevent their roots from injuring the aqueduct.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of
Gallicanus and Symmachus, 330.
2. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Pan-cratius, Prefect
of the City.
If anyone should hereafter be so insolent as to attempt to interfere with the
convenience of this Most Flourishing City, "by conducting water on his own land
from a public aqueduct, he is hereby notified that the said land will be
confiscated, and added to Our private domain.
Given at Constantinople, on the eighth of . . . , during the Consulate of
Timasius and Promotus, 389.
3. The Same Emperors to Albinus, Prefect of the City of Rome.
We order that those to whom a supply of water has been either formerly or
recently granted by Our indulgence shall obtain the same from the reservoir, or
from the springs themselves, and that they shall
not take it from the principal canals, so as to divert their course, or
diminish the amount; nor shall they draw it from the aqueduct itself.
If anyone should do otherwise, he shall not only forfeit the privilege which he
formerly enjoyed, but shall be severely punished, according to his personal
status.
Given at Rome, on the fifth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of
Timasius and Promotus, 389.
4. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Astorius, Count of the
East.
We decree that the use of water, based upon ancient and well-established
ownership, shall continue to be enjoyed by citizens entitled to the same, and
that they shall not be disturbed by any innovation; provided, however, that
each one takes the same amount of water which he was allowed in former times,
and that he takes it in the same way. Those who, by the use of secret canals,
abuse their privilege for the purpose of irrigating their fields, or adding to
the attractions of their gardens, shall be punished.
Given on the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of Cse-
sarius and Atticus, 397.
5. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian.
If anyone, through the generosity of the Emperor, should obtain the right to
use water, he must have the written authority to do so registered, not by the
illustrious Governor of the province, but by Your Excellency, and anyone who
attempts to have it registered by the Governor shall be punished with a fine of
fifty pounds of gold, and the same penalty shall be imposed upon this official,
if he accepts a rescript conferring such a privilege, when it has been
surreptitiously obtained. The subordinates of the said Governor shall also be
subjected to punishment by Your Highness. In addition to this, You must
determine the quantity of water, both hot and cold, which should be devoted to
the service of the public baths, in proportion to the number of citizens who
use them, as well as the amount of superfluous water to which those persons to
whom We have granted the privilege shall be entitled.
6. The Same Emperors.
Every servitude permitting water to be drawn from the aqueduct of Hadrian,
whether for domestic use, for the irrigation of land, for country villas, or
for baths, either by virtue of an Imperial Rescript, or secured by usurpation,
is hereby absolutely abolished; for We prefer that the aforesaid aqueduct
should be used to provide water for the public, hot and cold baths, and for Our
palace.
We decree that this law shall, by all means, be observed hereafter, and that
permission shall be granted to no one, in answer to a petition, to take water
from the said aqueduct, nor shall anyone venture to pierce it for that purpose.
All persons who, for any reason whatsoever, may think that they are entitled to
this privilege (or any official who dares to grant it, or even receive a
petition for that purpose), are hereby notified that they will be fined a
hundred pounds of gold for the
benefit of the Treasury. We order that no trees shall be planted within ten
feet of a public aqueduct, but that, on each side of the same, the space of ten
feet shall remain unoccupied and unobstructed.
Moreover, We decree that the same rule shall be observed with reference to the
leaden pipes which conduct water to the hot baths, called by the name of
Achilles, which We have learned that Your Highness has erected; for We desire
that the above-mentioned pipes shall only be used for providing the hot and
cold baths with water, which is the purpose for which you intended them.
Your Highness must also give authority to your subordinates to exercise
supervision over houses, suburban villas, and baths, without running any risk,
in order to prevent deception from being practiced, or suppression, or any
other illegal act from being committed by anyone against the public welfare, so
far as the use of water is concerned.
7. The Same Emperors.
All taxes on ladders which can be collected, as well as those paid by the
laborers called zizaceni,shall be employed for the repair of the aqueducts of
this Renowned City. It should also be observed that none of those who have the
right to use the water shall be subjected to any expense for repairs, as it
would be abominable for the inhabitants of this Beautiful City to be compelled
to purchase water.
8. The Emperor Zeno.
We order, by this law, that if any Urban Prefect should convert to other
purposes money provided for the construction or maintenance of aqueducts, he
shall be compelled to refund the amount out of his own property to be used for
the said aqueducts.
A separate treasurer shall be appointed to receive the money provided by the
illustrious Consuls, which has been donated by their liberality, or has been,
or may hereafter, be obtained from other sources to insure a supply of water
for the public.
9. The Same Emperor to Poratias.
We decree that careful investigation shall be made of fountains which were
originally public, as well as those which, derived from private sources, have
afterwards become public and then been converted to the use of private
individuals, as well as of such as have been surreptitiously obtained by
Imperial Rescripts; and, by all means, where a privilege of this kind is known
to have been secured unlawfully, and not under the pretext of Imperial
sanction, so that its rights may be restored to the Capital, and what was once
public shall not become private, but shall be devoted to the use of the entire
community.
Imperial Rescripts or pragmatic sanctions which have been obtained by any
persons, contrary to the welfare of the City, should be declared illegal and
void; nor can any prescription of long time be advanced for the purpose of
curtailing the rights of the City.
10. The Same Emperor to Pentius.
We decree that nothing shall be done by anyone, no matter what his rank, for
the purpose of interfering with the smaller aqueducts, or
the public fountains which flow into them. Whoever, either secretly or openly,
relying upon his authority, diverts any of the water from the said branches of
the aqueduct or fountains, or clandestinely takes water from the public
aqueducts, shall be compelled to make complete restitution of the same.
We also order that hereafter no trees whatever shall be planted near the said
aqueducts, in order that the walls of the latter may not be ruined by their
roots. The prohibition is known to have been established by the ancient
constitutions, and all persons are notified that, hereafter, any villa, field,
bath, mill, or garden in which public water is used, or in or about which trees
have been planted by the owner thereof which may injure the aqueduct, will
subject the man or the building to proscription, and his property shall be
confiscated to the Treasury. This penalty shall not be revoked even by an
Imperial Rescript.
Again, We decree that all inspectors and guardians of water, who are styled
hydrophylacs,who are appointed to have supervision of the aqueducts of this
Imperial City, shall bear Our name stamped upon their hands for the purpose of
identification, so that by this means they may be known to all, and not be
called upon to perform other services, either by the Stewards of Our Household,
or by anyone else, and be employed as couriers, or discharge various public
duties.
When any of said water-inspectors dies, We order that whoever is summoned to
take his place shall be designated with the same mark, so that, being thus
associated in a common service, they must exercise constant vigilance for the
preservation of the water, and not occupy themselves with other matters.
11. The Emperor Justinian to Servus, Prsetorian Prefect.
We order, by this law, that the Divine Constitution promulgated by the Emperor
Theodosius, of illustrious memory, with reference to those who wish to obtain
the right to take water from the public fountains, shall be confirmed, so that
no one, either in this Most Holy City, or in the provinces, shall be permitted
to draw water from any public aqueduct or fountain without a special permit
issued by the Emperor in the usual manner, and duly recorded, either by Your
Highness, or by other officials having authority to do so.
Those who violate this law, or permit it to be done, shall not only be
condemned to pay a fine of ten pounds of gold, but shall also be severely
punished.
TITLE XLIII. CONCERNING GLADIATORS.
1. The Emperor Constantine to Maximus, Praetorian Prefect.Sanguinary
exhibitions are not proper in the midst of civil tranquillity and domestic
peace, for which reason We absolutely prohibit gladiatorial contests.1
1 The gladiatorial combats of Rome, bloody and brutal though they were,
constituted the favorite amusement of both the nobles and the populace, a
conclusive

Paulinus and Julian, 325.
TITLE XLIV. CONCERNING THE CHASE OF WILD BEASTS.
1. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Maurianus, Count of the Domestics.
We grant permission to everyone to kill lions, and no one shall have any fear
of prosecution on this account. Moreover, We order that wild beasts which are
sent by the dukes of frontiers to Us cannot, while on the way, be kept in any
city longer than seven days. The violators of this law shall pay a fine of five
pounds of gold to the Treasury.
proof of national decadence and degeneracy. A tendency to reversion to the
primal state of savagery is indicated by the fact that these contests owed
their origin to the human sacrifices which, among the barbarous tribes of
Europe, once formed part of the obsequies of distinguished persons. Early known
to, and practiced by the Greeks, this custom was transmitted by the Etrurians,
from whom the Romans, in their turn, derived it. The celebration of the rite,
which subsequently became a pastime, was supposed to propitiate the Manes,
departed spirits and tutelary deities of families, whose thirst for blood was
one of their most prominent attributes. So important was its observance
considered that wealthy persons often bequeathed large sums of money to be
expended for this purpose.
These games were, at first, under the charge of the Eediles, but, afterwards,
special officials were designated to provide for and superintend their
presentation, which, having developed from a private ceremony into a public and
official function, was then transferred from the vicinity of the funeral pyre
to the Forum and the amphitheatre. On grand occasions, and when the number of
combatants was unusually large, the Circus Maximus, with its seating capacity
of three hundred and eighty-five thousand, was the scene of this thrilling but
repulsive spectacle. By means of it, personal popularity and political
preferment were eagerly sought by both demagogues and statesmen, who combined
the expectation of future, selfish advantage with the present, pious discharge
of filial or paternal duty. Csesar, on his accession to the office of curule
ajdile, in honor of the memory of his father, exhibited three hundred and
twenty pairs of gladiators clad in magnificent armor embossed and inlaid with
gold. Augustus, in his will, declared that he had caused ten thousand to fight
during his reign; Trajan, however, exhausted the same number of contestants for
life and death in the short space of twenty-three days.
There were no less than fifteen different classes of gladiators, who were
distinguished by their weapons, armor, dress, equipment, nationality, and mode
of battle. Regular schools were established for their instruction; their
teachers, or lanistse,directed their operations in the arena; they were
solemnly sworn "to be burned, conquered, scourged, put to death by the sword,
or whatever the master, to whom we, as regular gladiators, devote ourselves
body and soul, may command."
Gladiators were, at first, solely composed of captives, slaves, and condemned
criminals. They constituted a distinct caste, and their antecedents caused them
to be regarded with contempt even by the lower orders of the populace. Their
fine physique, feats of strength, skill, and daring, nevertheless, acquired for
them the covert, or even open admiration of the gentler sex, accustomed to the
scenes of blood and horror inseparable from the exercise of their profession.
The susceptible Roman damsels, ardent worshippers of force like all their
sisters, in the decadent days of the Empire lavished gifts and caresses upon
these social outcasts, to whose barbarous origin and former crimes they were
willingly blind. To them

Constantius and Constans; and also at Constantinople, on the fifth of the
Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of Our Lord Honorius, Consul for the
eleventh time, and Constantius, Consul for the second time, 417.
TITLE XLV. CONCERNING THE MAY FESTIVAL.
1. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Csesarius, Prsetorian
Prefect.
We have decided that the May Festival shall be re-established for the benefit
of the people of the provinces, provided that decency be observed, and modesty
and chastity be maintained.1
the successful gladiator was "Suspirium"or "Decus puellamm;""Him whom girls
sigh for," or "admire;" and his intrigues with high-born maidens were the
scandal of a capital already infamous for its monstrous and unbridled
profligacy.
While participants in contests in the arena were looked upon with disdain by
respectable Romans, this was not the case in early Greece, where men of the
highest rank measured their strength and prowess against one another in the
Olympic Games. This deep-rooted prejudice was subsequently, to a certain extent
removed, and under the Empire it was not unusual for senators, as well as
members of the equestrian order, voluntarily to take part in these combats, to
which no magistrate or tribunal had authority to sentence them by way of
penalty. The better class of citizens, however, considered this practice as
deplorable and disgraceful. "Feminarum in lustrium senatorumque plures per
arenam fcedati sunt."(Tacitus, AnnalesXV, 32.)
As disclosed by the famous Roman historian, certain women --- who in our age would
be referred to as "champions of advanced ideas" --- did not hesitate to don the
martial panoply of battle, and temporarily unsex themselves in their eagerness
for excitement and notoriety. Their efforts to this end, while not encouraged,
do not seem to have been disapproved by the officials in charge of the public
games. In common with the male competitors for popular applause, they were
compelled to obey the commands of the lanista,or gladiatorial trainer. "Nan dum
valida ac juvenilia membra Sufficiunt galese, dumque ardent sanguine, fertur,
Non cogente quidem, sed non prohibento tribuno, Scripturus leges et regis verba
lanistse,"
 --- (Juvenal, SatiresXI, 8.)
Although, at the instigation of the Christian clergy, many attempts were made
by Constantine and some of his successors to suppress gladiatorial exhibitions
by means of laws, edicts, and proclamations, still their hold on popular favor
was so powerful as to render these efforts fruitless, and it was not until the
reign of Justinian that they were actually and permanently abolished throughout
the Roman world. --- ED.
1 The celebration of the day sacred to Maia, the mother of Mercury, and Flora,
the goddess of flowers, associated largely with sex worship and the annual
regeneration of Nature, one of the most beautiful and attractive festivals of
antiquity, survived for many centuries in the holiday observance of the first
of May in Europe, whose erotic and Priapic character is disclosed by the
erection of the lofty pole garlanded with flowers --- a purely phallic
symbol --- around which village maidens in their best attire danced the livelong
day, profoundly ignorant of the origin or signification of the object in whose
honor their charms and graces were dis-. played, and which was the silent and
unappreciative recipient of their devoted homage. --- ED.

TITLE XLVI.
THE USE OF ARMS WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE EMPEROR Is FORBIDDEN.
1. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Buleforus, Consular of Campania.
No one shall, hereafter, without Our knowledge and consent, have the right to
bear arms of any description whatever.
Given on the third of the Nonesof October, during the Consulate of the Divine
Jovian and Varronian, 364.
TITLE XLVII.
CONCERNING FARMERS, TENANTS OF LAND REGISTERED ON THE CENSUS,1 AND SERFS.
1. The Emperor Constantine.
Farmers engaged in sowing seed or gathering their crops shall not be subjected
to extraordinary civil burdens, in order that proper time may be given them for
performing their necessary labors.
2. The Emperor Constantine to Dulcitius, Consular of Emilia.
When anyone wishes to sell or donate land, he cannot retain for himself the
serfs attached to it, nor can he by any private agreement transfer them
elsewhere. For those who think that serfs are an advantage should either keep
them on the land, or relinquish them to those to whom it has been sold, if they
themselves do not expect to obtain any benefit for the land alone.
Given at Milan, on the third of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of
Constantius, Consul for the ninth time, and Julianus, Consul for the second
time, 357.
3. The Emperor Valentinian and Valens to Faventius, Vicegerent of Italy.
Anyone who, through Our liberality, obtains vagrant slaves from deserted lands
will, on this account, be liable to the Treasury for the annual payment of the
same amount of rent which the Treasury formerly received from the land to which
the slaves were recently attached.
1 These were possessors of land under a tenure in some respects similar to that
of copyhold at Common Law, known to the Saxons as Bockland (or "Book-land"),
which was called "base" by the old English jurists on account of its being held
subject to the performance of villein services. (VideBracton, De Legibus et
Consuetudinibus AnglixII, Vill, 26; Fleta, Commentarius Juris AnglicaniI, 8;
Britton, De Juribus Anglicanis165; Littleton, Tenures X; Coke, Institutes I,
58a.) --- ED.
We desire that this rule shall also apply to those who have permitted slaves of
this kind to settle on their own land.
Given at Milan, on the day before the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of
Valentinian and Valens, 365.
4. The Same Emperors to Modestus.
Owners of land are notified that either they or their agents will be compelled
to pay the tribute originally imposed upon the serfs, in the places from which
they came. We decree that those shall be excepted from this rule who are the
owners of land, no matter what may be its value, and who have been registered
in their own names as owners in the office of the census; for it is proper that
they themselves should pay the tribute in grain to the regular collector, in
proportion to the amount of their possessions.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Gratian
and Dagalaifus, 366.
5. The Same Emperors to Orients.
The owners of land shall only exact from their serfs what it pro-. duces, and
they must not collect their rent in money, which rustics need not pay unless
the custom of the country requires it.
6. The Same Emperors and Gratian to Germanus.
The Governors of provinces shall compel all fugitive serfs, whether attached to
the glebe or not, as well as tenants without distinction of sex, occupation, or
status, to return to the land where they are registered, and have been born and
reared.
7. The Same Emperors to Maximus.
Just as it is not lawful for serfs attached to the soil to be sold separately,
so rustic slaves and registered serfs shall, by no means, be disposed of in
this way. Nor can anyone fraudulently evade this law (which has often been done
in the past with respect to serfs attached to the glebe) by conveying a small
portion of the land to the purchaser, and transferring therewith all the slaves
belonging to the entire tract; but where all the land, or a certain part of the
same is sold to anyone, the same proportion of slaves and serfs shall pass with
it, and the corresponding number of the same shall either be delivered or
remain with the former owners or possessors. If the purchaser should disobey
this law, he must consider the price which he paid as lost, and the vendor
shall, nevertheless, have a right to recover the slaves with any offspring they
may have.
If the vendor should, for any reason, decline to take advantage of this
provision, and die without having done so, We grant the right of recovery to
his heirs against those of the purchaser, without permitting prescription for
long time to be pleaded, for no one can entertain any doubt that he is a
possessor in bad faith who has bought anything contrary to the provisions of
the laws.
8. The Same Emperors to Probus.
All fugitive serfs who conceal themselves upon the land of another shall be
recovered, together with the tribute which they owe, that is to say, if those
in whose possession the slaves are found know that they were fugitives, and
belonged to someone else, and were used for his own benefit, in other words, if
they cultivated land the crops of which were to be given to the owners, or any
other services were exacted of them, and they did not obtain any compensation
for their labor, the tribute imposed upon them and which was lost by the
Government shall be collected from the proprietor of the land.
Where, however, the fugitives concealed the fact that they were of servile
condition, and represented themselves to be free when they applied to another
person, and cultivated land for the purpose of giving only a portion of the
crops to the owner of the same, reserving the remainder for their own
peculium,or if they received a fixed salary for the performance of certain
services, any tribute which may be due to the government shall be collected
from the fugitives themselves; for it is clear that a private contract was
made. But when any debtors are found among these fugitives (as is usually the
case where men of this kind are engaged in commercial transactions), the judge
shall compel what is due to be paid by those who are liable to the creditors
entitled to the same.
9. The Same Emperors to the People.
Exemptions which have been specially granted, that is to say, of both land and
personal taxes accorded by the municipal magistrates or Governors of provinces,
are hereby annulled, and those who enjoy them shall be returned to their former
condition.
Given at Milan, on the third of the Nonesof March, during the Consulate of
Merobaudus, Consul for the second time, and Saturninus, 383.
10. The Same Emperors to Cynegius, Prsetorian Prefect.
Formerly the rule with reference to the poll-tax was that it should be imposed
upon every man, and every two women; it shall now be imposed upon every two or
three men, or every four women. Therefore, Your Highness will order the amounts
of this tax as above indicated to be justly and properly inscribed on the
public registers, in the country of the Comanenses, in that of the Ariatensians
and Second Armenia, in the country of the Amasenes, in Helenopontus, in the
country of the Diocaesareans, and in Second Cappadocia.
11. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius.
We decree that original serfs shall be exempt through no privilege, dignity, or
authority, but that all the rights which have been at any time obtained by them
through favor shall be abrogated, and that they shall be restored to their
owner, or to the land to which they were attached.
12. The Same Emperors to Florentinus.
We desire that slaves, tributary serfs, or tenants shall remain with their
masters, for as all of them are apprehensive of punishment, a slave would have
no desire to flee, if he did not know with whom he could take refuge. For no
slave would abandon his master if he was not aware where he could conceal
himself, and every person should receive only those strangers whom he is
convinced are freeborn, and he should, through dread of becoming amenable to
the laws, decline to entertain anyone who merely asserts that he is free.
Therefore, if one of the above-mentioned fugitives should be found, he who is
harboring him shall pay twelve pounds of gold to Our Treasury; and We order
that he must not only return the fugitive to his master, but also give him
another slave of the same value, in addition.
13. The Same Emperors to Vicentius.
We decree that, so far as the origin of tenants and serfs is concerned, they
shall be considered as of the same condition, even though their names may
differ; and any children born to them shall follow the condition of their
father.
(1) The following rule must also be observed. Where a man is the owner of two
tracts of land, one of which has more serfs than are required for its
cultivation, he can transfer those which are not needed to the tract which is
deficient; and if the said tracts should be conveyed to different persons, the
transfer of the serfs above mentioned shall stand, but the owner of the land
from whom they were taken must restore their relatives to them.
14. The Same Emperors to Vicemtius.
If serfs that are held by anyone in good faith flee and take refuge with
others, and then attempt to deny their status, they must first be returned to
the possessor in good faith, and then the case of their birth and ownership can
be determined.
15. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius.
No collector of debts owing to the Treasury shall ever, in the name of their
masters, molest serfs who are indebted to it, for the reason that We declare
that serfs are so absolutely attached to the glebe that they should not be
removed therefrom for a single instant of time.
16. The Same Emperors to Palladius.
Where a woman, who is shown to be a serf by birth, marries a freeman in any
city or place whatsoever, it has been decided by the ancient laws that all her
offspring will follow her condition.
17. The Same Emperors to John.
It is declared by jurisconsults that nothing which can, in any way, prejudice
the title of the land to which a serf is attached, shall be done by him without
the knowledge or consent of the owner.
18. This Law is Not Authentic.
19. The Emperor Valentinian.
We do not, under any circumstances, permit serfs to be admitted into the army,
nor do We grant them the privilege of serving as aids to commanders, because,
in this instance, We take into consideration not only the rights of their
masters, but also the honor of the public service.
20. The Emperor Justinian to Demosthenes, Praetorian Prefect.
With a view to accelerating the progress of litigation, We order that when
serfs, of any class whatsoever, dispute the title of their master to the land
which they cultivate, and We are in doubt on the point whether the master is
the owner of the land or not, or whether the serfs themselves are entitled to
the ownership of the same, it is hereby decreed in such cases that the serfs
must furnish sufficient security before their claims can be heard, except where
their masters are unable to defend themselves by prescription of long time, and
the sureties furnished must guarantee that if the masters gain the case, they
will pay what is due to them.
A surety of this kind shall only be accepted for the term of three years, and,
at the expiration of that time, he must be replaced by another, and, in the
meanwhile, the serfs shall, under no circumstances, be annoyed by their masters
on account of any quitrent to which the latter may be entitled.
(1) Where, however, the serfs are either unwilling or unable to do this, then
the annual quitrent shall be exacted by the judge, at the usual time when it
was paid to the owners, and it shall either be deposited in a church or with
the magistrate of the city within whose jurisdiction the land is situated; or,
if the local church is not suitable for the deposit of the money, it shall with
every necessary precaution be placed in the metropolitan church, and after the
decision has been rendered, it must either be paid to the owners of the land,
or refunded to the serfs.
(2) Moreover, when the quitrent does not consist of money, but is either wholly
or in part paid by the delivery of a certain portion of the crops, the latter
must be sold by the court, and the proceeds of the same deposited in the manner
aforesaid.
(3) The above-mentioned provisions have reference to quitrent paid to the
owners of land, and We must now pass to the duties required by the State.
If the serfs themselves were in the habit of paying what was due to the
Treasury in a certain way, they shall continue to do so, without prejudice to
the owners of the land, who have no right to interfere with the discharge of
the indebtedness to the State, so long as the serfs remain quiet, and offer no
opposition. Where, however, it was the custom for the owners of the land to
receive the entire amount, and pay a portion of it to the Treasury, retaining
the remainder for themselves in satisfaction of their quitrent, then, if a
surety is fur-
nished by the serfs, he must guarantee the payment, not only of the ouitrent to
the owner, but also the tax due to the State, in order that the obligations of
the owners to the Treasury may be discharged. No prejudice shall, on this
account, result to the serfs, for the owners must remain content with the
security furnished with reference to the ouitrent to which they are entitled.
(4) Where, however, no security was furnished, but the property has been
sequestered and the money deposited, the judge shall take from the amount
sufficient for the payment of what is due to the Treasury, and the owner shall
be given receipts, just as if he himself had paid it, while the remainder due
for quitrent must be deposited in a safe place, until the termination of the
lawsuit.
No prejudice shall result either to the serfs or their masters (because of any
security of this kind) from the sequestration of the property, or the payment
of the sum due to the Treasury, but everything shall remain in suspense until a
decision has been rendered by the court disposing of the entire affair,
clearing up the whole controversy, and showing who was the owner of the land,
and to whom the receipts for what was due to the Treasury shall hereafter be
given, and to whom the quitrent shall be paid or belong.
Read seven times in the New Consistory of the Palace of Justinian.
Given . . . ,. during the Consulate of Decius, 529.
21. The Same Emperor to the Senate.
In order that it may no longer be doubted what is the status of a child born to
a female serf and a freeman, or to a female serf and a slave, or to a male serf
and a female slave, or whether the condition of the serf or a slave is rendered
worse, We order that what has been provided by former laws with reference to
children of this kind, who are the issue of female serfs and freemen, shall
remain unaltered; and therefore any issue of serfs shall follow the condition
of their mother.
If, however, a child should be born to a male slave and a female serf, or to a
female slave and a male serf, it shall follow the condition of its mother,
whether she was a slave or a serf, which rule has hitherto only been observed
with respect to free persons and slaves. For does any difference exist between
slaves and serfs, both being under the control of their masters, as a slave can
be manumitted with his peculium,and a serf be released from ownership along
with the land to which he is attached ?
22. The Same Emperor to Julianus, Praetorian Prefect.
As we are aware that our laws do not allow the rights of any one to be
prejudiced on account of his condition, either from his admissions, or because
of any written document, unless additional evidence is produced, We order that
an admission alone, or any private written paper shall not be sufficient to
decide whether or not a man is a serf, but that some other instrument in
writing, either taken from the public records or derived from some other source
recognized by law, must be offered for the purpose of confirming a document of
this kind. For, in the
settlement of such controversies, it is better for the condition of anyone to
be established by different proofs, and that men who, perhaps, are free, may
not be reduced to servitude, merely by admissions, or by the production of
private papers.
If, however, the writing should be confirmed by a subsequent admission, or a
deposition (made voluntarily, and without the employment of force, or as the
result of necessity), or if an instrument having reference to his status, or
any other public document, which had been recorded, should be produced in which
the party in question wrote, stated, and deposed that he was a serf, then the
result of all these combined proofs, that is to say, of the writing, the
admission, and the deposition, would be that the person who wrote and made the
solemn declaration aforesaid was what he represented himself to be.
(1) Again, a doubt, which is not unreasonable, formerly arose, where the son of
a serf had remained at liberty free for the term of thirty or forty years, or
even longer, while his father was still living, and cultivating the soil, and
the owner of the land, for the reason that he was satisfied with the services
of his father, did not require the presence of the son on his premises,
whether, after the death of the father or after he had become infirm, and
incapable of agricultural toil, his son could be excused on the ground of his
long-continued freedom; and, because for many years he had neither cultivated
the soil, nor performed any other of the labors of a serf, his master could
only blame his own neglect, as every duty which he required was performed by
his father.
In all cases of this kind, it seems to Us to be very harsh that the rights of
the master should be prejudiced by the absence of his serfs, who, having been
born on the land and afterwards being absent, cultivated it by means of either
their fathers, their brothers, or other relatives ; for as a portion of his
body remained upon the land in the form of his relatives, he should not be
considered either to have been absent, to have been on a journey, or to have
possessed his freedom. The rights of the owner shall therefore remain
unimpaired, and so long as the ascendants, descendants, or collaterals of the
serf shall remain on the land, he himself shall be considered to be there.
23. The Same to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
As it would be extremely unjust for land, which was in the beginning provided
with serfs, afterwards to be deprived of its members, as it were, and serfs
residing on the lands of others to cause serious loss to the owners of the
land, We decree that, as in the case of decurions, no one is released from his
obligations by lapse of time, so those belonging to the condition of serfdom
cannot be liberated by the passage of years; nor can anyone of this class claim
his freedom on account of any protracted negotiation, but he shall always
remain a serf, and be attached to the glebe; and if he should lie concealed, or
attempt to withdraw from the soil, he shall, like a fugitive slave, be
understood to have stolen himself by long-continued treachery, and shall remain
in this class, together with all his offspring (if he should have begotten
any upon the land of another), and shall be liable to the payment of quitrent,
from which he cannot be released by any act of generosity
whatsoever.
(1) Since the Anastasian Law provides that the children of anyone who has been
attached to land as a serf for thirty years shall remain there, and not have
the power to migrate elsewhere, the question arose '.whether the children of
either sex --- even though they may not have remained for the term of thirty years
on the land or in the village ---  should be considered serfs, or whether only
their father, who had belonged to this class, should, for that time, be
designated as such, We hereby order that the children of serfs shall, in
accordance with the terms of the above-mentioned law, remain forever free, and
cannot be reduced to an inferior condition; still, they shall not have
permission to leave the land and migrate elsewhere, but must always remain
attached to the soil which their fathers have cultivated.
Moreover, the owners of the land to which such serfs are attached must be
careful not to annoy them in any way, nor inflict any violence on them; but if
this should be proved to have been done, and a decision rendered by a judge to
that effect, the Governor of the province in which the act was perpetrated
shall see that the injury is atoned for (if any took place), and the ancient
custom with reference to the quit-rent is observed; and permission shall be
granted to the serfs to leave the places where they reside.
We decree that this rule shall apply not only to serfs themselves, but also to
their children of both sexes and of all ages, so that any who have been born
upon the land may remain there subject to the same regulations and conditions
under which We have prescribed that their parents should reside upon land owned
by others.
(2) Again, no one shall be permitted knowingly and deliberately to harbor on
his own premises any serf or dependent attached to the land of another. Where,
however, he has received him in good faith, and afterwards ascertains that
someone else is entitled to his services, or is notified of this fact by the
owner of the land, or the master of the serf, either in person or by his agent,
he must restore the serf with all his peculium,and his offspring. If he should
fail to do this, he shall be compelled to settle all claims due to the
Treasury, whether derived from the land, or payable annually, for which the
serf was liable during the time he remained with him. This shall be
accomplished by the care and diligence of the prefect and the Governor of the
province, by whom punishment shall be inflicted, and restitution shall be made
in accordance with the ancient constitutions.
24. The Same Emperor to John, Prsetoricm Prefect.We decree that, when male
serfs marry free women, no matter with what intention or by what contrivance,
either with or without the knowledge of their masters, the women as well as any
children who are known to have been born from such a marriage shall retain
their freedom. It should, however, undoubtedly be observed that where a child
ig'born to a free husband and a wife who is a serf, it will follow
the servile condition of the mother, and will not enjoy the freedom of its
father.
And, in order that serfs may not think that an attempt of this kind will go
unpunished (which is greatly to be feared), and that the condition of men of
this kind may not decrease little by little on account of their marriages with
free women, We decree that if any such act should be perpetrated by a male
serf, his master shall himself have full authority to punish him by the
imposition of a moderate penalty (or the Governor of the province can do so),
and separate him from the woman. If he should neglect to do this, he can only
blame his own negligence for any loss which he may sustain.
TITLE XLVIII.
CONCERNING THE EXEMPTION OF CITIZENS FEOM THE CAPITATION TAX.
1. The Emperors Constantine to Eusebius, Governor of Lycia and Pamphilia.
The people of the City of Rome (as is also the case in the provinces of the
East) shall not be subjected to the imposition of a poll-tax, but are by this
law entitled to exemption from the same.
Given on the Kalendsof June, during the third Consulate of Constantine and
Licinius, 313.
TITLE XLIX.
IN WHAT CASES REGISTERED SERFS CAN ACCUSE THEIR
MASTERS.
1. The Emperor Constantine.
Any serf, from whom more is exacted by his master than was required of him in
former times, and he was previously accustomed to pay, should appear before a
judge as soon as he can obtain access to him and prove the offence, so that he
who is convicted of having demanded more than he was in the habit of receiving
may be prohibited from doing so hereafter, having first restored what he is
known to have extorted by this illegal demand.
2. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius.
Serfs inscribed upon the register of the census are not subject to the same
tributes as those whose names are not enrolled thereon, but as they who are
compelled to make annual payments as the result of their condition are, to a
certain extent, in a state of servitude, it would be intolerable for them to be
permitted to institute legal proceedings against persons by whom there is no
doubt that they can be sold along with the land to which they are attached. We
shall hereafter deprive them of permission to do this, for no serf must dare to
bring his mas-
ter, to whom he and all his property are known to belong, into court, for it
has frequently been decided that a serf cannot, without the knowledge of his
master, sell, or alienate in any other way, the land to which he is attached,
just as he whom the laws do not permit to have any property of his own, and who
is not authorized to acquire or transfer it, and whom the laws only permit to
obtain and hold property for the benefit of his master, cannot appear against
the latter in court. Hence We exclude persons of this kind from appearing
against their masters or patrons in all civil proceedings, except in cases of
extortion, in which former Emperors have granted this privilege, and We also
deny them the right to prosecute the latter criminally by accusations of a
public character, except where some injury has been committed against them or
their relatives.
TITLE L. CONCERNING THE SERFS OF PALESTINE.
1. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens.
As the law promulgated by Our predecessors prescribes that serfs shall remain
in the condition in which they were born in all the other provinces subject to
Our Empire, so, in order that they may not be able to depart from those places
which they are engaged in cultivating, oorrabandon the soil which should always
be tilled by them, and as this does not apply to the owners of land in the
Province of Palestine, We now decree that no serf of Palestine shall have the
right to wander about, and boast that he is free, but shall, as in other
provinces, be subject to the proprietor of the land, so that he cannot depart
therefrom without being liable to punishment; and it is also added that full
authority to claim him is hereby granted to the said proprietor.
TITLE LI. CONCERNING THE SERFS OF THRACE.
1. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius.
The poll-tax is hereby forever abolished throughout the entire Province of
Thrace, and only the land tax shall be paid. And, in order that permission may
not appear to have been granted to serfs liable to tribute, to withdraw and
wander wherever they please, they themselves shall be retained in their
original condition; and, even though they may appear to be freeborn, they shall
still be considered to be attached to the land where they originated; nor shall
they have the power to go wherever they choose, or to change their residence,
but the owners of the land shall exercise over them the rights and care of
patrons and the authority of masters.
Moreover, if anyone should think he has the right to harbor or retain a serf,
he shall be compelled to pay two pounds of gold to him whose land the fugitive
serf abandoned, and he shall also surrender the latter, together with all his
peculiumand his children.
TITLE LII.
CONCERNING THE SERFS OF ILLYRIA.
1. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius.
We decree that the vassals and tenants of both Illyria and the neighboring
countries shall not have permission to abandon the land to which it is certain
that they are attached by origin and birth, but shall continue to cultivate it,
not on the condition of paying tribute, but under the name and appellation of
serfs; so that if they desert it and go elsewhere, after having been brought
back they can be placed in chains, and subjected to other punishment. The
penalties denounced against those who receive the serfs of others, even if they
are not known to be such, shall be enforced, and shall consist of indemnity for
the services which were lost, and the injury sustained by the place which they
abandoned, as well as of a fine, the amount of which We leave to the discretion
of the court; so that the owner of the land on which the serf is shown to have
been employed may be compelled to suffer punishment in proportion to the nature
of the offence; nor shall there be any ground for ignorance, as the mere fact
that he kept possession of a serf who was unknown to him will, of itself, be
sufficient to establish the offence.
Again, if anyone should receive a slave in any of the countries above
mentioned, he shall not be allowed to excuse himself through ignorance, but
will be liable to a penalty of fourfold damages; and, in addition, must make
good the losses sustained by the owner of the slave.
We decree that the same rule that We have prescribed concerning emancipated
serfs * shall be observed with reference to freedmen who are harbored in this
way.
1 The Romans divided tenants, in general, into two classes: inquilini,or lessee
of houses, and coloni,or lessees of land. The first of these terms was, for the
most part, applied to persons who rented property in towns or cities.
The primary and usual signification of colonuswas serf, otherwise designated
servus terras,or adscriptus glebss(one who is attached to the glebe). The
colonusoccupied an anomalous position in the eye of the law. He was nominally
free, enjoying the right to marry and make other valid contracts, was subject
to taxation, and could do many other things forbidden to a slave. Still his
liberty was far from absolute, as he was obliged to remain on the land where he
was born, and not only was he prohibited from leasing it, but his master could
not dispose of him separately, or even manumit him. He was, therefore, as his
name implies, practically a part of the soil upon which he performed his daily
toil. His children were also hereditary bondmen, and the offspring of a female
serf, like that of a slave, in accordance with the maxim "Partus sequitur
ventrem,"followed the condition of the mother.
While the colonuscould own personal property, he could not alienate it without
his master's consent.
He did not necessarily owe his status to the accident of birth. He might
voluntarily acquire it by announcing his intention before a competent tribunal,
and contracting marriage with a female of the class in which he desired to be
enrolled. The same rule was applicable to women. When once assumed, however,
the acquired status of the individual could 'never be renounced or abandoned.
TITLE LIII.
No ONE SHALL EXTEND PROTECTION TO PEASANTS OR SUPPORT THEM IN ANY CHANGES WHICH
THEY MAY
MAKE.
1. The Emperor Leo to Eryfh/rius, Praetorian Prefect.
If anyone, after the publication of this law, should, for the purpose of
defrauding the State out of any tax or obligation which is due, claim the
protection of a person of rank, whatever has been enacted on this
It was often found to be a convenient and profitable manner of permanently
disposing of able-bodied mendicants and impostors, by the authorities, to
arrest and turn them over to some land proprietor as coloni,and thus, from
being a burden, they became a benefit to the community.
The method of leasing to coloniwas similar to that employed at the present day.
Rent could be made payable in cash, or by giving a share of the crop; and when
discharged by the delivery of farm products, the tenant was styled colonus
partiarius.The nature of the compensation was, however, entirely regulated by
the agreement made between the contracting parties.
It was an ancient rule of law that where a man who was actually free cultivated
land as a serf for the term of thirty years, the title to it became vested in
him without any qualification whatever. Such tenants were known as coloni
liberi.The privilege of thus obtaining liberty and property simultaneously by
usucaption was rescinded by Justinian. The condition of colonus,originally an
incident of conquest, and universally imposed upon the provinces of the Empire,
survived for many centuries in Eastern Europe, and "has only within a
comparatively recent
period been abolished.
The Saxon ceorl(or churl) was the prototype of the villain of the English .law.
The social position upon which his integrity (or lack of it) was presumed to
depend was so lightly considered that the oath of a thegn,or lord, was
judicially declared to be equal to that of six villeins,or ceorls. "Thaini
jusjurandum contravalet jusjurandum sex villanorum."(Ancient Laws and
Institutes of England; Leges Regis Henrici PrimiLXIV, 2.) The wer-gild,or fixed
sum which a homicide was compelled to pay to the family of his victim, in
Northumberland, was, in the case of an ealdorman --- that is a general, noble, or
royal councillor ---  thirty times greater than that which could be demanded by the
relatives of a ceorl. The status of the latter, who, like the Roman colonus
liber us,was nominally free, was, nevertheless, a most onerous and degraded
one.
The churl is thus defined by an old English legal writer:
"Ceorle (that is of the Carle or Churle) and Husbandman. The Ancients
called him in Latin Villanus,not as we ordinarily take it for a Bondman, but
, for him that dwelling in a Village or Country Town, lived by the Country
course
of Husbandry.
"Such were the Ceorls among the Saxons; but of two sorts, one that hired the
Lord's Out Land or Tenementary Land (called also the Polcland) like our
Farmers; the other that tilled and manured his Inland or Demeans (yielding
Operamnot Censum,Work and not Rent), and were thereupon called his Socmen or
Ploughmen. These, no doubt, were oftentimes his very Bondmen.
"The first sort, who having ordinarily no Lands of their own, lived upon the
Outlands before mentioned of their Lord the Thane, as customary Tenants at his
Will (after the usual manner of that time), rendring into him a certain portion
of Victuals, and things necessary for Hospitality. This Rent or Retribution
they called Feorme, but the word in the Saxon signifieth Meat or Victuals; and
tho' we have ever since Henry IPs time chang'd this reservation of Victuals
into Mony, yet in letting our Lands, we still retain the name of Fearms and
Fearmers
unto this day.
"But this Service was no Bondage. For the Ceorl or Husbandman might as well
leave this Land at his Will, as the Lord might put him from it at his Will:
subject, either under the pretext of a donation, a sale, a lease, or any other
contract, shall be void; and all notaries who dare to draw up such instruments
shall be punished by the confiscation of their property ; provided they acted
knowingly, and the estates or lands of those who have appealed to the
protection of the said powerful person shall be confiscated.
Moreover, all those who, contrary to the public welfare, have been convicted of
having extended their patronage to persons intending to defraud the Treasury,
if they are of noble rank, shall be condemned to pay a fine of a hundred pounds
of gold; and if they are of moderate fortune, shall be punished by the loss of
all their property; and those also who, by their wicked arts, have dishonorably
encouraged these nefarious acts, shall suffer the same penalty.
We order that this law shall be valid and enforced from the time fixed by the
constitution promulgated by the Emperor Martian, of Divine Memory; that is to
say, in the province of Thrace, for thirty years from the Consulate of ^tius,
Consul for the second time, and Sigisbuldus; and in the East and the Provinces
of Egypt, Pontus, and Asia, for twenty-six years, that is to say from the
Consulate of Cyrus.
and therefore it was provided by the Laws of Ina in what manner he should leave
the Land when he departed from it to another Place. And the Writ of Waste in
Pitz-Herbert seemeth to shew that they might depart if they were not then well
used.
"It is apparent also that the Ceorl was of free Condition, for that his Person
was valued as a Member of the Common-Wealth in the Laws of ^thelstan and his
least valuation is there reckoned to be 200, whereas the Bondman was not valued
at all, for that he was not (as I said) any part of the Commonwealth, but of
his Master's Substance; nor was he capable of any Public Office. But the Ceorl
(tho7 he had no Land) might rise to be the Leader of his Country-men, and to
use the Armour of a Thane or Knight, viz. an Helmet, and Habergeon, and a gilt
Sword. And if his Wealth so increased as that he became owner of five Hides of
Land, the valuation of his Person (which they call'd his Were or Weregild) was
increased to two thousand thrimsas,that is six thousand shillings, and being
then also adorned with other marks of Dignity, he was counted for a Thane."
(Spelman, English Works II, Pages 14, 15.)
Early English authorities practically place villeins in the category of slaves,
their condition being due to their birth. "Sunt autem nativi a prima nativitate
sua, quemadmodmn si quis fuerit procreatus ex nativo & nativa, ille quidem
nati-vus nascitur. Idem est si ex patre libera & matre nativa."(Glanvil,
Tractatus De Legibus et Consuetudinibus AnglissV, 6.) When a freeman married a
woman born in villeinage, he "lost his law," and himself became a villein. The
issue of two villeins of different sexes, belonging to different lords, was
divided equally between the latter.
Coke describes villeinage as follows: "Villenagiumis the service of a bondman.
And yet a freeman may doe the service of him that is bond." (Institutes I, II,
116a.) Those subject to this tenure were of two kinds, villeins in gross, who
were attached to the person of their lord, and could be sold or donated by him;
and villeins regardant, who were attached to the soil. The condition of the
villein was one of abject submission to his lord. He was substantially a mere
chattel, like the horse and ox with which he toiled. He could hold no property
of any description, not even conditionally or precariously, in which he was
inferior in privileges to the Roman slave. The degrading menial services to
which he was liable were defined only by the caprice of his lord. The latter
could inflict severe corporeal punishment upon him, but had no right to maim,
or kill him. Unlike
2. The Emperor Justinian.
We decree that when the tributary of anyone marries a woman who is the
tributary of another, or, on the other hand, when some one's female slave
marries the slave of another, the children of the tributary, as well as those
of the slave, will follow the fortune of their mothers, and will belong to the
owners of the latter.
TITLE LIV.
PEASANTS SHALL NOT BE SUBJECTED TO ANY NEW OBLIGATIONS.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars.
No peasant, residing outside the walls of a town, who pays his poll-tax or
contributes his amount of grain, shall be subjected to any other obligations by
the Receiver of Our Treasury, nor shall he be compelled to furnish mules or
horses for the public service.
the colonus,the villein could be voluntarily manumitted by whoever was entitled
to his services. Freedom thus obtained was, as with the colonusunder other
circumstances, qualified, and only applicable to cases in which the interests
of the lord and his successors were involved. Hence, if a villein, who had been
liberated, appeared in court against a stranger, he could not, even if he had
been knighted, proceed, if his birth in villeinage was established by his
adversary. When a lord sued his villein or seduced his wife, either of these
acts, ipso facto,immediately caused his emancipation. Residence for a year and
a day in a town enjoying franchise either by prescription or charter, enabling
him to be admitted into the community as a citizen, also released him from the
obligations of villeinage. (VideGlanvil, Ibid.,V, 5.)
According to the old English law, there were two methods by which a person
could be subjected to the obligations of villeinage.
"Also, every villein is either a villeine by title of prescription, to wit,
that See and his ancestors have been villeines time out of mind of man; or he
is a villeine by his owne confession in a court of record.
"But if a freeman hath divers issues, and afterwards he confesseth himselfe to
be a villaine to another in a court of record; yet those issues which he hath
before the confession are free, but the issues which he shall have after the
confession shall be villaines." (Littleton, Tenures II, II, Secs. 175, 176.)
This confession is interpreted by Coke to mean that a freeman could not, as
under the Civil Law, voluntarily adopt the status and incident disabilities of
a serf; and that it merely meant that he publicly acknowledged that he was born
in that condition, and therefore had hitherto, occupied a position in society
to which he was not entitled. (Coke, Institutes III, II, 117b.) If this be the
case, it seems extraordinary that his children, born while he was in reality a
serf, should become free; while their father, whose status always legally
remained the same, despite the pretended character which he had wrongfully
assumed, was reduced to bondage.
The requirements of serfdom, during the Middle Ages, were far more exacting and
oppressive in France than in England. The tyranny of the nobles was exercised,
almost without restraint, upon the unhappy dependent, whose birth rendered him
a slave in all but name. The odious privilege known as the Jus primse noctis,or
"Droit de prelibation,"attaching to many fiefs, including those held by the
clergy, by which the bride of a serf was at the discretion of her lord
immediately after the marriage ceremony, and which was unknown in England, was
one of the most reprehensible but popular of the seigniorial rights enjoyed by
the privileged classes of the kingdom, which were swept away by the
Revolution. --- ED.
2. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Probus, Prsetorian Prefect of
Ittyria.
Any of those belonging to the retinue of Governors of provinces, who hold the
first rank in different offices, and, under the pretext of public duty, have
the power to commit extortion and impose upon any peasant who is required to
render them services, just as if he was their own slave, or deprive him of his
slaves or his cattle, for the purpose of converting them to their own use,
shall, having been deprived of all their property, be sentenced to perpetual
exile, and any peasant who voluntarily assists in the perpetration of such acts
shall be punished with equal severity.
Given at Agrippina, on the day before the Kalendsof October, during the
Consulate of Valentinian and Valens, 365.
TITLE LV.
THE RESIDENTS OF A MOTHER-VILLAGE ARE NOT PERMITTED TO TRANSFER THEIR LANDS TO
STRANGERS.
1. The Emperors Leo and Anthemius to Nicostratus, Praetorian Prefect.
Through motives of humanity, We deem it necessary for the following provision
to be added to those previously enacted with reference to what are called
"mother-villages," to prevent the owner of land from transferring the same to a
stranger, under any circumstances. Hence, if anyone should desire to alienate
land which belongs to him, he shall not be permitted, under the terms of any
contract whatsoever, to convey the ownership and possession of said land to
anyone except a registered inhabitant of the same village, and all strangers
are hereby notified that if they attempt to conclude, or obtain possession of
property by means of a transaction of this kind, in violation of what is
forbidden by law, every such agreement entered into will be of no force or
effect, and if it has been completed, and the property delivered, the latter
shall merely be returned.
TITLE LVI.
No RESIDENT OF A VILLAGE SHALL BE LIABLE FOR THE DEBTS OF OTHER RESIDENTS OF
THE SAME VILLAGE.
1. The Emperor Zeno.
It is not only a serious offence in law, but it is also contrary to the
principles of natural equity that persons should be molested on account of the
debts of others, and therefore, We forbid injustice of this kind to be
perpetrated against the inhabitants of villages under any circumstances.
TITLE LVII.
CONCERNING TAXES, TAX GATHERERS, APPRAISERS, AND INSPECTORS.
1. The Emperor Constantine to the People.
As the receivers of taxes in cities, acting in collusion with powerful persons,
are in the habit of transferring the greater part of the burden of taxation to
persons of inferior rank, everyone who is able to prove that he has been
imposed upon in this way shall only be required to pay the amount originally
allotted to him.
Given at Rome, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate
of Constantine, Consul for the third time, and Licinius, 313.
2. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Eutro-pius, Prsetorian
Prefect.
Anyone who cuts down his vines, or removes the buds from his fruit trees, for
the purpose of avoiding the payment of taxes, and fraudulently represents
himself to be poor, shall be subject to the penalty of the law as soon as he is
detected. But as you are found to have done this without fraudulent intent, and
not for the purpose of causing sterility or the failure of the fruit crop, but
in order to increase production, you will incur no criminal responsibility.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Nonesof June, during the
Consulate of Eucherius and Syagrius, 381.
3. The Same Emperors to Cynegius, Prsetorian Prefect.
If anyone should make complaint of having been imposed upon, and an appraiser
should be despatched for the purpose of investigation, and the tributary should
then remove his agent, or eject his tenant, under the pretext of his obstinacy,
he shall, by Our authority, be compelled to pay the amount of the tax fixed by
the appraiser, during his own absence, or that of his agent.
Given at Constantinople, on the sixth of the Kalendsof April, during the
Consulate of Our Prince Honorius and Evodius, 386.
4. The Emperors Theodosius, Arcadius, and Honorius to Rufinus, Prsetorian
Prefect.
All land shall be inscribed upon the rolls of the Census, and whenever relief
is demanded, the amount of tax assessed upon sterile and barren soil shall be
made up by a levy upon that which is cultivated and productive.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Nonesof April, during the
Consulate of Theodosius, Consul for the third time, and Abundan-tius, 393.
5. The Same Emperors to Rufinus, Prsetorian Prefect.Those who complain of
having been imposed upon by appraisers, and allege that they have been
subjected to unjust burdens, have the
right to accuse them, if any indulgence was granted to others, or any property
was fraudulently misappropriated, and shall be entitled to relief, where they
can prove that they have been treated with injustice, or that a criminal
transaction has taken place, for the purpose of favoring others.
This, however, should be done within a year after the record was made, by which
it appears that an inequitable burden was imposed, and, during the same time an
accusation must be brought against the appraiser, and the fact that he has
favored another in consideration of having been paid must be established, so
that he may be held responsible for the amount of the excess which he
fraudulently misappropriated from the contribution due to the State.
This action shall not be barred by lapse of time, except in the case of minors
who are undefended. Those who were absent on public business, but who acted
within the time prescribed by law, shall, for this reason, have power to apply
to the courts for relief.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Kalendsof December, during the
Consulate of Our Lord the Emperor Theodosius, Consul for the third time, and
Abundantius, 393.
6. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Eusebius, Praetorian Prefect.
When appraisers and examiners are found guilty of negligence, or of illegally
favoring anyone, they shall not only be subjected to the loss of their
property, but shall also be forced to pay a fine equal to four times the amount
of their salaries. Those who are convicted of having accepted anything to the
prejudice of the people of the provinces shall be compelled to pay fourfold
damages.
Gfoen at Milan, on the fourth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of
Arcadius and Honorius, Consuls for the third time, 396.
7. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Sebastian, Count of the First Rank.
Where abandoned land has been transferred by an appraiser to anyone, the latter
shall retain possession of the same without being disturbed. Moreover, We do
not permit the Treasury to molest the new owner, on account of any previous
contributions which remain unpaid, as one should not be responsible for the
fault of another. If, however, any private individual should allege that land
abandoned up to the present time is encumbered in his favor, or that he is
entitled to it for some other reason, he must prove his allegations v/ithout
delay, either in person, or through someone else authorized by law to do so, in
order that, if his claim is an equitable one, the property may be transferred
to him, and he who received it from the appraiser shall be reimbursed for the
expenses incurred in the improvement of the property.
But, to prevent donations, once made, from being interfered with by means of
litigation, We decree that the term of six months shall be established, within
which time he who thinks that he has a good
title to the property must institute the proper proceedings to recover iitt..When,
however, the term above designated is permitted to expire, We are unwilling for
any attempt to be made for its recovery. If anyone should, either in his own
proper person, or by his representatives, neglect to take this step, when the
appraiser adjudges him the land, and the six months should elapse, he shall not
be able to do so at any
time thereafter.
\Given at Ravenna, on the day before the Idesof March, during the Consulate of
Honorius, Consul for the eleventh time, and Constantius, Consul for the second
time, 417.
TITLE LVIII.
CONCERNING ABANDONED LANDS AND WHEN SUCH AS
ARE BARREN ARE CONSIDERED TO BE ATTACHED TO THOSE
THAT ARE FERTILE.
1. The Emperor Constantine.
As Our relative, the Divine Aurelian, ordered the decurionates of cities to be
responsible for the taxes due on abandoned lands, as well as on those whose
owners cannot be found, so We decree that, after the first three years of
possession, they shall be exempt from all enforced contributions.
We decree that this law shall be observed, and if it should be established that
the said decurionates are not able to pay the taxes assessed on said lands, the
latter shall be divided among the citizens.
2. The Same Emperor.
When anyone buys land from a tenant holding under emphyteusis, or having a
private right to the same through inheritance, upon which other real property
is dependent, and the strength of the latter having become undermined, it falls
into decay, any burdens attaching to the ownership of the said land which was
useless while in the hands of the person who abandoned it must be borne by the
purchaser.
Given at Thessalonica, on the eighth of the Idesof December, during the
Consulate of Felicianus and Titian, 337.
3. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens.
Anyone who obtains deserted land under a grant of immunity from taxation for a
certain time shall not be placed in possession of the same before sureties, who
are solvent, have been furnished at the risk of the decurions, or he has
hypothecated lands of his own which should be of good quality, and thereby have
given sufficient security that the land acquired by him will not be abandoned
with any detriment to the public welfare.
4. The Same Emperors and Gratian to Crescentius.Testamentary heirs are also
obliged to sustain fiscal burdens imposed upon unproductive land belonging to
the estate, or if they think
that they should reject the estate, they must restore to it everything which
they have received therefrom, by any right or title whatsoever. Given on the
fourth of the Ides ofJuly, during the Consulate of Gratian, Consul for the
second time, and Probus, 337.
5. The Emperors Valentinian and Theodosius.
Persons who have acquired productive lands from the State shall also receive
other lands which have been abandoned, and if they should consider themselves
aggrieved by the addition of lands which they formerly abandoned through
disgust, they must transfer them to other decurions, who will hold them under
the condition of paying the taxes assessed upon both, for it would be unjust
for the choice land to be retained by a few persons, and the decurionate to be
oppressed with the burden imposed by the remainder.
6. The Same Emperors.
Where a lessee is in possession of a fertile tract of land, which has been
acquired from the public domain, or from some temple, an unproductive tract
shall be united with it. When, however, the lessor refuses to accept it,
another possessor must be sought for on the same terms, and if a voluntary
lessor cannot be found, then the land shall revert to the ancient possessors,
that is to say, the decurions, or any others whomsoever, with the addition of
the barren land as above mentioned, after solvent sureties have been furnished.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof February, during the
Consulate of Merobaudus and Saturninus, 383.
7. The Same Emperor.
Anyone who cultivates an abandoned tract of land belonging to Our private
domain, and renders it fertile and valuable shall, in accordance with the rule
established in such cases, become the private owner of the same forever, and
shall hold it as his own property, just as if he had acquired it by inheritance
from his ancestors, and shall have the right to bequeath it to his descendants;
nor can anyone, by the production of a rescript, or of any other Imperial
written instrument, exclude him from the enjoyment of the fruits of the labor
which he has performed.
Moreover, We order that those who are in possession of rich and fertile lands,
or even think that they are now entitled to any such, shall be liable for all
taxes due at the time on lands which have been abandoned. Those, likewise, who
hold lands which are neither fertile nor altogether sterile, under the tenure
of emphyteusis, as in the case of those who are also in need of relief, must
remember that after the term of two years has expired they shall, in conformity
with the ordinary rule, be liable for the regular taxes which may be due.
No one, no matter what his rank or power may be, shall be released from the
obligation of receiving as his own lands which have been abandoned, and which
formed part of Our patrimony, and he must pay the tributes and tax imposed upon
them.
It should also be specially observed that the adjoining owners will primarily
be liable for this payment, and if the said lands do not join, and are not in
the same neighborhood, those farther away will be responsible. The appointment
should be made in such a way as to be based upon propinquity, or regulated by
the intervening space, and in such a way as to be in conformity with justice
and moderation, so that what is for the profit of all may be effected by
universal consent.
8. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Tatian, Praetorian
Prefect.
Where anyone desires to cultivate fields abandoned by their owner, -whether
they are situated at a distance, or are adjacent to his own premises, and
whether they belong to private individuals, or are part of the public domain,
he is hereby notified that he has Our authority to do so; provided, however,
that if the new cultivator establishes himself on the vacant or abandoned land,
and the former owner wishes to assert his right to the same within the term of
two years, he shall have the right to do so, after having, in the first place,
reimbursed the recent occupant for any expenses which he may have incurred. If,
however, the said term of two years has expired, he who remained silent during
the time shall have no right to either the possession, or ownership.
9. The Same Emperors and Uonorius.
All those, without exception, who hold under a lease lands belonging to Our
private domain, are hereby informed that they are required to accept lands of
inferior fertility along with those which are productive, and they must not
refuse to hold them, or, if they reject fields which are sterile, they must
surrender those which are fertile.
10. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Eutychianus, Pr&-torian Prefect.
Persons who have received rich and fruitful lands from the State shall be
compelled to accept, along with them, a proportionate amount of sterile and
unproductive soil.
Given at Constantinople, on the Nonesof March, during the Consulate of
Honorius, Consul for the fourth time, and Eutychianus, 398.
11. The Same Emperors to Hadrian.
The owners of abandoned lands shall be summoned by public proclamation to
return, resume possession of the same within the term of six months, and pay
any taxes which may be due. If, however, they show by their absence that the
land did not produce crops sufficient to pay the tribute, and they refuse to
return, the land shall be transferred to those who are willing to accept it,
and who promise that they will certainly pay the tribute in arrears. They shall
then obtain undisputed ownership of the said land, and are notified that, if
afterwards they discharge the indebtedness they will be subjected to no
annoyance, and will not, through the intrigues of anyone whomsoever, be
deprived of the land which they occupy. We also enjoin upon them
the payment of tribute from the time when they first acquired possession of the
land in question.
12. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Seleucus, Prsetorian Prefect.
We order, by this law, that no possessor of land which is profitable shall be
rendered liable for debts due from other persons whose land is unproductive,
and that fertile lands shall not be considered as united with others which are
sterile, unless it is shown that they belong to the same person; and this rule
is established to prevent any extortion from being committed under any pretext
or fiction.
Given at Ravenna, on the day before the Kalendsof February, during the
Consulate of Honorius, Consul for the eighth time, and Theodosius, Consul for
the fifth time, 412.
13. The Same Emperors.
The managers and the owners of land are warned that if, through their fault,
the tribute due on account of said land is not paid, it will be absolutely
necessary for the ownership of the same to be transferred.
14. The Same Emperors.
Lands which decurionates have, under some contract, which has been duly
registered with the Governor of the province, either abandoned or conveyed to
others, shall remain permanently in the possession of those who cultivated
them, and pay the tribute due to the Treasury, and the decurionates shall not
have the power to reclaim them.
15. The Same Emperors to Sebastianus.
Where anyone has legally received, from the proper authority, any deserted
lands, taxes upon which were levied for the benefit of the navy, and which have
remained abandoned up to this time, it is proper that they should be improved
in every respect, and that the naval assessment should not be imposed upon them
except when other financial burdens have been suspended.
16. The Same Emperors to Hermogenes.
When anyone, by the authority of the Emperor, receives unproductive lands
forming part of the Imperial domain, under the agreement to pay a certain tax,
We desire him to retain undisputed possession of the same in consideration of
his paying annually the amount which the Emperor has declared must be paid; and
We decree that the said land shall hereafter not be subjected to any new tax,
additional burden, or imposition whatsoever, as it would be absurd for persons,
at Our request, to improve unproductive lands which demand the exertion of
great labor, or the expenditure of entire fortunes to complete said
improvements, so that being deceived, and compelled to assume an unexpected
burden, they may allege that they have been, as it were, defrauded; and that if
they had known that the lands had been
transferred to them under such conditions, they would have refused to accept
them, or even to engage in their cultivation.
17. The Emperor Valentinian.
We order that no decurion shall be responsible for any taxes due from the lands
of others, but shall only be obliged to pay what is assessed upon his own
property.
Given at Ravenna, on the fifth of the Kalendsof May, after the Consulate of
Felix and Taurus, 429.
TITLE LIX.
CONCERNING LANDS AND THEIR BOUNDARIES, MARSHES, PASTURES, FRONTIER MILITARY
STATIONS, AND THE GARRISONS OF FORTRESSES.
1. The Emperors Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian to Licinius, Prsetorian
Prefect.
Tiberianus designated certain lands whose owners were charged with the
transportation of grain to the frontiers after having carefully weighed the
ability of the latter to discharge this duty, hence We, by this general law, do
order that the regulations of Tiberianus shall be observed, hereby annulling
every exemption which may have been obtained through the influence of anyone,
or by means of some petition furtively presented for that purpose; and, in
addition, We decree that, for the future, no one shall be permitted to evade
this ancient custom, ,or refuse obedience to the present law, or request that
it may not be enforced.
2. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius.
The possessor of lands attached to fortresses must surrender and abandon them,
for the reason that only those to whom they have been assigned are entitled to
hold lands attached to fortresses, unless some ancient custom is applicable to
them.
If any private individual, who is not a soldier of the garrison of a fortress,
should hereafter be found in possession of such lands, he shall be punished
with death and the confiscation of his property.
3. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian.
Where soldiers have been accustomed to take care of, and plow lands on the
frontiers, together with the marshes in the neighborhood, for their own
benefit, under some ancient law, free from all public burdens, and when the
said lands are, at present, in cultivation, they shall be held by said soldiers
without question as to their title, and free from the imposition of any tax;
and if such lands are in the possession of Others, they can not be acquired by
the latter through lapse of time, and can be recovered from all those who hold
them; and We desire them to be transferred to the said soldiers without being
liable to any enforced contribution, as was prescribed by an ancient law.
The penalty of confiscation shall be inflicted upon those who violate the
present rule, for when anyone by purchase holds possession of property like
that above mentioned (which he should, by no means, venture to do), he will
unquestionably have a right of action against the vendor.
TITLE LX. CONCERNING PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PASTURES.
1. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius.
As there is no reason why the rent of pastures belonging to Our private domain
should be increased, this must not be done according to the pleasure of
decurions, for We have learned that higher rent has been collected by them, and
that they have also excluded animals belonging to Our private domain from said
pastures. The Emperor Julian, of Divine Memory, forbade this by a decree which
he promulgated, and therefore, Your Excellency having summoned the Governors of
provinces, will inform them that this liberty which the municipalities have
assumed cannot be tolerated, but that the same custom which was established in
ancient times shall continue to prevail.
2. The Emperors Arcadia and Honorius.
Your Excellency must see that animals belonging to soldiers are excluded from
all public fields and pleasure grounds, and forbid them to be pastured there,
and all persons, including your subordinate officials, are notified that if
anyone should, hereafter, make use of the above-mentioned fields for this
purpose, he shall be compelled to pay twelve pounds of gold to the Treasury,
and the same penalty shall be imposed if the fields belonging either to private
individuals, or to the citizens of Antioch, are trespassed upon in this manner.
Decurions must, however, provide for the maintenance of animals belonging to
the soldiers, without causing any injury to the inhabitants of the provinces.
3. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to All Counts and Generals.
Lands belonging to the inhabitants of Our provinces, as well as those of Our
private domain, must not be injured or interfered with by soldiers, and
therefore, by the present law, which has been promulgated to the Prefecture for
execution, We decree that this abuse shall not occur hereafter. Your Highness
will not delay to see that all necessary measures are taken, in this instance,
for the enforcement of the laws, and you must not permit the owners or tenants
of land to be annoyed by any acts of soldiers whatsoever.
Given on the Nonesof September, during the Consulate of Honorius, Consul for
the tenth time, and Theodosius, Consul for the sixth time, 415.
TITLE LXI.
CONCERNING LANDS AND FORESTS BELONGING TO THE EMPEROR, AND EMPHYTEUTICAL
CONTRACTS AND LESSEES UNDER THE SAME.
1. The Emperor Constantine to Cypitus.
If anyone should, without judicial authority, alienate lands held under
emphyteusis, the alienation shall stand, provided the person who received them
is compelled to pay the rent due to the Treasury at the specified times.
Published on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of
Constantine, Consul for the fourth time, and Licinius, Consul for the third
time, 315.
2. The Same Emperor to Dracontius.
We order that the failure to pay rent due for land belonging to the domain of
the Emperor, within the time prescribed, whether the payment is to be in money
or grain, shall not prejudice the ownership of minors, nor shall they sustain
any injury if what is due should be paid a little later, provided the judge
compels the guardian or curator, through whose negligence payment was deferred,
to make good the loss sustained, and also subjects him to the penalties
incurred for the non-performance of his duty.
3. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Germanianus, Count of the Imperial
Largesses.
Those persons who have received lands by the right of emphyteusis cannot refuse
to pay the rent, under the pretext that the land was sterile, even if they have
fraudulently obtained a rescript for that purpose. Nor shall they be deprived
of the said lands, even if a higher rent has been promised by another, but they
shall remain forever in the hands of those who have received them, and of their
posterity, although a rescript to the contrary may have been obtained against
them.
4. The Emperors Valens, Gratian, and Valentinian.
Persons who have obtained lands forming part of Our private domain, which have
come into Our possession in different ways and are now held under emphyteusis,
shall have no fear of their being confiscated, for We convey the entire
ownership of said lands, rather than merely lease them, provided the lessees
afterwards, at the proper times, pay the rent which has been agreed upon.
5. The Emperors Gratian and Valentinian.
When any person receives land belonging to Our domain, which has been abandoned
by former tenants, or those who held under emphyteusis, from the proper
authority, he shall retain said land forever,
by an undisputable right, nor shall the demands of any second claimant be
heard.
6. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius.
Persons to whom lands belonging to the Imperial domain situated in the
provinces of Asia or Pontus, and which has been donated to them by Us, or by
Our Divine Ancestors, shall hold possession of the same without molestation,
and transmit them to their heirs.
So far as the transmission of the property is concerned We desire that this
rule shall apply not only to descent to their heirs, but also to every kind of
contract which the donees may enter into.
7. The Same Emperors to Cynegius.
Those who obtain lands forming part of the Imperial domain, or which belong to
the State under emphyteusis by Our order, if they are sufficiently solvent to
pay the rent, must pledge their own property by way of security for such
payment, to provide against the said lands being abandoned. When, however, they
are not solvent, they can acquire the land by emphyteutical right, after having
furnished proper sureties, and the officials whose duty it is to have charge of
such matters are notified that if any loss results from their negligence, and
the security given should not prove to be good, they themselves will be
responsible.
8. The Same Emperors to Nedearchus.
All the lands belonging to Our private domain, situated in the Mesopotamian and
Osdroenian provinces, and which were set apart by the orders of Our Imperial
predecessors for the use of soldiers on the frontier, shall all be restored to
their former condition, notwithstanding any objection which may be urged
against this as everything which was formerly destined for the necessities of
the frontier should be preserved, and no one shall be heard who advances any
claim based either upon a rescript, an Imperial annotation, an emphyteutical
contract, or a lease of any description, which has been obtained through Our
liberality.
9. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius.
All persons are hereby notified that with the exception of the tax, nothing in
common exists between land privately purchased by the Emperor and that already
belonging to the Imperial domain, so that appraisers must never confuse the
two, and those who venture to violate the present law shall be severely
punished.
10. The Same Emperors to Eutychianus, Praetorian Prefect.
Your Highness will order that only those lands belonging to Our private domain,
which have been granted to anyone through Our liberality with the reservation
of a specified tax, shall be considered in the same class with those also
forming part of Our private domain,
which have been rented conditionally, so that any tenants who are oppressed by
the burdens imposed upon them may be relieved, and their liabilities
transferred to others who are more prosperous, and the apportionment of tribute
thus be equally divided.
11. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius.
We order that the right of emphyteusis, by which land is held without being
subject to any other requirement, shall remain forever unimpaired, but We are
unwilling that mere possession should obtain the benefit of prescription, which
possession has been invalidated without the existence of any special
obligation.
12. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Taurus, Praetorian Prefect.
Possessors holding land of the Imperial domain by the right of emphyteusis, and
who, up to this time, have not purchased the property, cannot be compelled to
do so, but they shall be considered as having paid the price of the same; and
hence they obtain the benefit of Our generosity, so that the emphyteutas
aforesaid will obtain through Our liberality what another could secure by
paying the purchase-money. They are advised that the title to the land which
they cultivate, and of which they have obtained possession either by
inheritance, private purchase, Imperial generosity, or in any other way
whatsoever, will remain unimpaired and inviolate, and that permission will be
granted all holding under emphyteusis to emancipate slaves attached to said
land of the Imperial domain as they are the owners of said land.
13. The Same Emperors to Florentius.
We order that, hereafter, no one shall be allowed to transfer to private
individuals any portion of the Imperial domain, or any lands situated on the
frontier, or any forests throughout the East, whether said lands are subject to
taxation or exempt.
Persons who violate this law shall be liable to a penalty of fifty pounds of
gold, which, shall be incurred by a petitioner, as well as by the officer who
grants the request, even though an Imperial annotation or a pragmatic sanction
may be produced by way of justification.
14. The Emperor Anastasius.
We order that all those who, in any diocese, province, forest, or city
whatsoever, have now, or may hereafter obtain possession of lands belonging to
the Imperial domain, or to temples, or to a director of the public games, or to
any other government official whomsoever, without any title, up to this time,
for forty years without interruption (this possession being computed not only
with reference to those who now hold the land, but also with reference to
others who formerly held it), or who may hereafter possess real property of
this kind for the aforesaid term of forty years, need entertain no fear of a
public action, or
of molestation or annoyance of any description whatsoever, concerning the
ownership of the land or buildings above mentioned. But if they pay the annual
tax imposed, which is dependent upon the nature of the right under which the
said lands or premises are held by him to whom they were granted, they shall be
considered as absolutely belonging to those who are now in possession, or may
afterwards obtain possession of the same.
Hence all persons shall be excluded from raising the question as to their
ownership, under any pretext whatsoever, and an exception based upon any title,
or even without any title to actual possession, for the term of forty years,
will suffice; and it must be added that those also who can prove that lands of
this kind were originally given to them by order of the Emperor, exempt from
any liability, and that they have lawfully been in possession of them for forty
consecutive years without the payment of rent, no tax which (as above stated)
has not been imposed during the possession of forty years can afterwards be
levied, for the reason that We have established the rule that, in both cases,
that is to say, where the tax is either reserved or released, the rights of the
parties in possession shall, without any change whatever, remain in the same
condition in which they continued during the term of forty years, as aforesaid.
TITLE LXII.
CONCERNING SLAVES AND SERFS ATTACHED TO THE
PRIVATE DOMAIN OF THE EMPEROR, PASTURES, AND
LANDS HELD UNDER EMPHYTEUSIS.
1. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens.
Serfs commit a wrong against emphyteutas by taking possession of lands of
greater extent than they are accustomed to cultivate, as they are not legally
entitled to handle any which have not been planted with olive orchards, or
vines by their own labor. They also attempt to illegally make use of the water
of springs, the benefit of which emphyteutas, alone, are permitted to enjoy. It
has therefore been decided that, hereafter, the right to and enjoyment of water
shall only be permitted to emphyteutas, and that serfs shall obtain from them
no more than is manifestly required for the irrigation of the fields which they
themselves cultivate, and that they must make arrangements with the emphyteutas
in possession to pay rent for any superfluous water which they may need for the
purpose of tillage.
2. The Emperors Valens, Gratian, and Valentinian.
Receivers of the Treasury shall, by the authority of this law, rescind all
grants of freedom which may have been bestowed upon slaves attached to Our
Imperial domain, or to lands held under emphy-teusis, by persons who are not
the owners of the same.
3. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius, to Post-humianus,
Prsstorian Prefect.
We have ascertained that serfs who, from ancient times, have been attached to
Our private domain, have been removed by persons to whom the same has been
granted by Us, and that their own slaves, or other serfs, have been placed
there in their stead. Therefore, by the authority of this Edict, We direct that
those who, hereafter, attempt anything of this kind, shall be deprived of the
said land.
4. The Same Emperors to Cynegius, Prsetorian Prefect.
It was recently established by Our laws, enacted with reference to maintaining
Our domain in good condition, that the serfs who formerly cultivated the land,
and have in some instances settled elsewhere, and others who have enlisted in
the army, could be reduced to the status of their ancestors, and recalled to
the discharge of their specific duties.
We do not, however, by any means intend that those who, having performed
military service, deserve to be left in leisure and peace, and are entitled to
the privilege of veterans, should exchange their weapons for plows and hoes.
TITLE LXIII.
CONCERNING FUGITIVE SERFS ATTACHED TO THE IMPERIAL ESTATES, AND TO FORESTS AND
LANDS HELD UNDER EMPHYTEUSIS.
1. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadiws.
Whenever any sons of decurions, or serfs attached to the Imperial domain, or to
any of the forests belonging to the same, with reference to which their
ancestors or parents were required to perform public duties, have with the
connivance of military officers, or other persons, enlisted in the army, or
obtained other employment, they shall be recalled to their municipal duties or
to the cultivation of their lands by the commanders and tribunes aforesaid, nor
shall their past military service be of any advantage to them.
2. The Same Emperors to Cynegius, Przetorian Prefect.
Anyone who leads astray or secretly harbors a serf attached to the Imperial
domain shall not only be compelled to restore him, but shall also be subjected
to a fine of a pound of gold by way of penalty.
Published at Constantinople, on the eighth of the Kalendsof November, during
the Consulate of Our Prince Honorius, and Evodius, 886.
3. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius.
All persons attached to lands belonging to the Imperial domain, who have been
removed therefrom by the authority of an Imperial annotation or rescript which
has been or may hereafter be obtained,
and who are serving in any rank in the army, shall immediately be sent back
under a suitable guard appointed by the Governor of the province.
TITLE LXIV.
CONCERNING OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED UPON THE OCCUPANTS
OF LANDS BELONGING TO THE IMPERIAL DOMAIN AND
OTHERS HELD UNDER EMPHYTEUSIS.
1. The Emperor Constantine to Proculiis, Proconsul of Africa.
Possessors holding under emphyteusis, although they may have been released from
extraordinary impositions through Our indulgence are, nevertheless, like other
inhabitants of the provinces, liable to the payment of taxes for the repair of
the roads, for there is no reason why they should be exempt from what is for
the common benefit of all.
Published at Carthage, on the Nonesof May, during the Fifth Consulate of
Constantine, and the Caesar Licinius, 319.
2. The Same Emperor to Catulinus.
It is not proper for lands constituting part of the Imperial domain to be
subjected to extraordinary burdens, or be compelled to give half or a third of
the crop, as it is well known that they, for the most part, already pay a
rental either in money or in grain.
Anyone who attempts to violate this law shall be punished.
Published at Carthage, on the sixth of the Kalendsof September, during the
Fifth Consulate of Constantine and Licinius.
3. The Emperor Julian.
All persons who are in possession of land belonging to the Imperial domain,
whether they hold them in common or in their entirety, shall be required to pay
their shares of all taxes charged against said land, either in proportion to
their ownership or to the full amount, just as the necessities of the public
welfare impose the obligation of payment upon all private individuals.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Mamertinus
and Nevitta, 362.
4. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens.
It has been decided that the possessors of land held under emphyteusis, as well
as of that belonging to the Imperial domain, shall be permitted to give to the
Receiver of the Treasury, at any time that they wish, as much of the rent as
they may have (provided that it is not paid in more than three installments
during each year), and that they shall be entitled to receipts for said
payments, upon the same day, as is customary, provided that the entire sum due
is paid to the Public Receivers before the Idesof January.
Any official who refuses to accept these payments on account, at any time of
the year (provided they do not exceed three in number),
or is guilty of delay in giving a written receipt for the same, shall be
subjected to severe punishment.
The possessors of the land or their agents must, under such circumstances,
apply to a magistrate or someone who represents him, and has power to act, so
that the insolence of the officials may be proved and punished, and the
interests of the parties be protected.
5. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius.
The tax imposed upon occupants of the Imperial domain, in all the provinces,
shall be collected by the ordinary judges, and whatever is obtained shall be
deposited in the Treasury.
Moreover, the above-mentioned judges are notified that none of the private
property of the Emperor, nor any of the tax derived from the same, shall be
devoted to other purposes, unless they desire their audacity to be punished
with exemplary severity.
TITLE LXV.
CONCERNING THE LANDS BELONGING TO THE PRIVATE ESTATE OP THE EMPEROR, AND THE
FORESTS ATTACHED TO THE IMPERIAL HOUSEHOLD.
1. The Emperor Constantine.
All persons are notified that any property which they have purchased or may
purchase from Our Treasury can, under no circumstances, again be claimed by Us,
that all such possessions are irrevocable, and that the ownership of the same
may be transmitted to their heirs for all time.
2. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens.
Those whose private convenience demands the acquisition of lands belonging to
Our private domain can apply to Your Excellency, set forth their wishes by
means of a petition, and rest assured that every estate will pass to the new
owner, together with the tax or financial burden to which it is at present
liable, so that, no matter what may be expended upon the property by his care
or industry, or whatever increase of slaves or cattle may take place, he will
not be subjected to any additional poll or land tax, but that the benefit of
the same will accrue solely to the owners of the property and their heirs.
Moreover, if anyone should fail to pay the tax due each year, at the designated
time, and he is proved to be in default, he shall be compelled to make payment
without delay. And if he should be found to be insolvent, and not able to pay
the prescribed tax, We order that the property which he received for Our estate
shall be transferred to someone else who is solvent, but that the latter shall
not be oppressed with the payment of the arrears of his predecessor.
3. The Emperors Gratian and Valentinian.
Where anyone, having acquired land belonging to Our private estate in his .own
name, either by the right of emphyteusis or under an ordi-
nary lease, transfers the said land to a person who is insolvent, and unable to
pay the tax or rent to which the land is liable, he who transferred the same
shall be subrogated to his successor, and shall always remain responsible for
the payment of what is due.
4. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius.
All lands belonging to the temples shall be committed to the care and
administration of the Stewards of Our private estate, and they must always
exert themselves with peculiar zeal to the collection of the entire amounts due
from them, as has always been the case.
5. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius.
The use of water destined for the irrigation of Our lands is said to have been
appropriated by many persons, and this having occurred through the connivance
or deceit of Our Stewards, the usually fertile soil, which has been deprived of
it, has failed to yield any crops to the cultivators of the same. Therefore,
for the reason that it is extremely unjust that Our estates, formerly in a
flourishing condition, should now become arid and barren, We order that the
water shall be conducted to its previous destination, irrespective of any
prescription.
6. The Same Emperors.
No one having charge of Our Imperial domain shall molest another who has served
for thirty years as the member of a guild, a decurionate, a barough, or any
other corporate body without his right being challenged, but the latter shall
continue to be a member of the said decurionate or corporate body to which he
is attached.
Given at Milan, on the third of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of
Stilicho and Aurelian, 400.
7. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian.
No one shall purchase any part of the private estate of the Emperor which is
not subject to some rental, and if anyone should, hereafter, enter into a
prohibited contract of this description, We desire that he shall forever lose
the price which he paid, and have no right to present any claim for expenses
incurred, or for any improvements which he has made on the property, nor can he
flatter himself that he will be entitled to any advantage arising from
prescription, except where this is authorized by former laws.
Any officer of the palace who permits such a contract to be entered into, or
who draws up a petition to this effect, must pay a fine of fifty pounds of gold
to Our Treasury. No order which is prejudicial to Our interest shall be valid
in a case of this kind, even though it may be an Imperial annotation or
pragmatic sanction authorizing such a sale, contrary to what has been provided,
nor shall the penalty imposed upon the officer of the palace be remitted.
TITLE LXVI.
CONCERNING THE LANDS AND FORESTS BELONGING TO THE PRIVATE DOMAIN OF THE
EMPEROR.
1. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius.
If anyone should turn his flock of sheep or his drove of horses into the
pastures forming part of the private estate of the Emperor, it shall
immediately be confiscated to the Treasury. If this should take place hereafter
through the corrupt connivance of the Imperial Stewards, We order that they
shall be subjected to the severest punishment.
2. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian.
Where anyone has the audacity to occupy lands belonging to Our private domain,
the said lands shall be restored to their former condition, in accordance with
the ancient registry, and any rescripts fraudulently obtained, or any
prescription based upon long time, or any new record of the census shall, under
such circumstances, be of no avail, for the title to Our property cannot be
annulled by a false report, a lasting possession, or a new registry.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifth of the Kalendsof April, during the
Consulate of Arcadius, Consul for the fourth time, and Honorius, Consul for the
third time, 396.
TITLE LXVII.
CONCERNING THE CULTIVATORS AND SLAVES BELONGING TO THE DOMAIN OP THE EMPEROR,
OR THE IMPERIAL
TREASURY.
1. The Emperor Constantine.
No original serf attached to Our private domain shall be raised to any dignity,
or be called upon to perform any curial duties, as it is not necessary for the
decurions of towns and other citizens from whom any number of appointments of
competent persons can be made, to be degraded by a selection of this kind for
high municipal honors.
2. The Same Emperor to Januarius, Pr&torian Prefect.
We order that Our serfs who have been employed by private individuals for the
purpose of keeping accounts, or for the tillage of _the soil, be reduced to
their former status, and only be used in the cultivation of Our lands.
Moreover, the rule must hereafter be observed that none of them shall undertake
the transaction of anyone's private business, or any other administration
whatsoever.
3. The Same Emperor to Equitius.
Slaves and serfs, their children and grandchildren, and any other persons
attached to Our lands and demesnes, who clandestinely engage
in other occupations, shall be returned to their former status, even if they
have already been enrolled in the army, for We decree that they shall be
discharged and return, even if they have attained to the rank of protectors.
4. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius.
You will cause all children of either sex, born to men of free birth and female
serfs or slaves, to be assigned to the condition to which their mothers belong.
5. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius.
We do not permit serfs attached to Our private estates to be subject to tax, or
compelled to perform extraordinary services, especially when these are said to
be imposed upon them contrary to long-established custom.
6. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian.
Whenever it is decided to sell any portion of Our private domain to a serf, it
must not be conveyed to one alone who may, perhaps, become a burden and
annoyance to his associates, but two or more of the same origin and status
shall be joined in the aforesaid transaction.
TITLE LXVIII.
CONCERNING CERTAIN LANDS, AND CHILDREN BORN TO
SERFS ATTACHED TO THE IMPERIAL DOMAIN, AND OTHER
PERSONS OF FREE CONDITION.
1. The Emperor Zeno.
If a free serf, of either sex, should marry a Tamiac man or woman, the children
who are the issue of a union of this kind shall be considered Imperial serfs.
If, however, a serf attached to the glebe, or a slave belonging to another,
should marry a female serf or slave belonging to the Imperial domain, or a
female serf or slave should marry a male serf or slave attached to the Imperial
domain, the children born of such a marriage will be free, and We order that
they shall enjoy the rights conferred by the ancient laws.
2. The Emperor Justinian.
We remember that a pragmatic sanction was promulgated which provided that when
Tamiac estates situated in the provinces, as well as Gomatic lands subject to
certain impositions (that is to say to land-taxes and tributes) were sold, the
price paid for the same must be deposited in the Public Treasury, but although,
by the said pragmatic sanction, the most complete validity is given to
contracts of sale of this description, still, in order to grant perpetual
security to the purchaser, We do hereby order that by the terms of this
Constitution all such purchases shall have an indisputable title to such lands.
TITLE LXIX.
CONCERNING DIFFERENT URBAN AND RUSTIC ESTATES BELONGING TO TEMPLES AND CITIES
AND ALL CIVIL
REVENUES.
1. The Emperor Julian.
Where any persons erect buildings upon public lands, they shall be compelled to
pay a fixed rent for the same.
2. The Same Emperors.
The cities of Pamphilia, as well as all others, shall have an indefeasible
right to any property they may acquire.
3. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Our Beloved Vincent.
It is certain that the third part of the tax payable annually on account of
ground and lands belonging to the State is abundantly sufficient to provide for
the repair of the public walls.
Given at Milan, on the third of the Nonesof July, during the Consulate of
Olybrius and Probinus, 395.
4. The Same Emperors.
We decree that those who have offered the highest price for property belonging
to the Imperial domain, or to the temples, and have been or may become the
possessors of the same, shall have the indisputable ownership of said land, and
that, hereafter, there shall be no question as to the right of possession of
any of them, but each one shall hold the property as his own, where the
contract is fulfilled by the payment of the purchase-money.
5. The Emperor Valerian.
If any persons, after the Consulate of Ausonius and Olybrius, should, either by
way of donation or purchase, or under any other title whatsoever acquire lands,
houses, or warehouses owned by a municipality (and particularly to this Eternal
City to which We owe especial favor), or any real property belonging to the
Director of the Games, none of which are subject to any civil imposition, We
order that the same tax shall be imposed upon them to which their former
proprietors were liable, and which shall be established by having recourse to
the records of the municipality 'to which said property belongs, for if We do
not suffer the debts due to private individuals to be evaded, there is much
more reason why what is legally due to cities should be liquidated, as it is
sufficient for the possessors to pay the imposition for the sake of securing
the perpetual ownership which they have acquired through Our indulgence.
Those who, at present, hold lands belonging to municipalities, shall discharge
their obligations to the Treasury of Our Imperial Largesses, whether the lands
have never been exempt from taxation, or it has subsequently been imposed, and
if this law does not have reference
to them, they should pay the tax to which they are now liable to Our private
Treasury, as is customary, and the title to said property shall, in like
manner, remain forever indisputably vested in them and their successors.
6. The Emperor Zeno.
We order, by this law, which shall be valid for all time, that the right to
collect forty solidiannually, a tax imposed upon property situated in the
territory of the City of Apamena by the possessors of the same, that is to say,
Callimachus, Eliburnus, Emptorius, Vera-torius, and Epotius, shall be restored
to the City of Nicea and its inhabitants, after the expiration of the third
indiction.
Everything which was enacted by the law of the Emperor Martian, of Divine
Memory, to the prejudice of the said City of Nicea, is hereby annulled, and
whatever was granted by the said laws to the City, and which has in the
meantime, under any pretext, been diminished shall, by the authority of Our
present Constitution, be restored to the said cities, so that no judicial
authority, nor any Imperial Rescript which may at any time be produced will, in
any way, affect the validity of this frequently referred to general law.
If anyone should violate its provisions, he shall be severely punished.
TITLE LXX.
CONCERNING THE LEASING OP LANDS OWNED BY CITIES,
OR BELONGING TO THE TREASURY, THE TEMPLES, AND THE
PRIVATE OR PUBLIC IMPERIAL DEMESNES.
1. The Emperors Gratian, Theodosius, and Arcadius.
It is provided by an order of Our Divine Father that lands belonging to Our
private domain shall be transferred by perpetual lease in such a way as to be
at the risk of the officials making the transfer. For no one can fail to
discharge his duty if the lands are assigned by judicial decree to persons who
are solvent, or what is due to the Treasury be, in this way, properly secured,
and when either one of these things is neglected, the rent can be collected
from the property of the officials responsible for the transfer.
2. The Same Emperors to Nibrius.
In accordance with an ancient law, lands belonging to the State should not be
taken away from those to whom they have not been leased, and who have not been
authorized by Us to hold them (when persons have fraudulently obtained
possession of the same), provided they have improved them by diligent
cultivation, and permission has subsequently been granted to occupy them.
3. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius.
All lands and estates belonging to the government, which have been offered at
auction, and have, in conformity to law, been disposed of to the highest
bidder, shall be leased to him in perpetuity.
4. The Same Emperors to Minervius, Count of Private Affairs.
It is consonant with the principles of equity for ancient possessors of public
lands to be preferred to recent lessees, if they are willing to pay a higher
rent.
5. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Volusianus, Praetorian Prefect.
Lands belonging to Our private domain which have once been leased in
perpetuity, either directly by Our authority, or by that of Our illustrious
Count of the Private Treasury, or which may be leased to anyone hereafter in
this manner, cannot be transferred in perpetuity to another. For, by the
present Edict, We decree that the possession of property leased in perpetuity
cannot be transferred, even if the Emperor himself should sanction it, either
upon request or voluntarily, by a written annotation or a pragmatic sanction.
If the illustrious Count of Private Affairs should consent to a proceeding of
this kind, in violation of the provisions of this law, he himself shall be
compelled to pay a hundred pounds of gold by way of fine, and his subordinates
shall be required to pay the same amount to the Imperial Treasury, and no order
of this kind shall have any validity after the promulgation of this law, nor
shall the land be leased to another, even though he may be willing to pay a
higher rent.
Therefore, every person making a contract under a perpetual lease shall be
secure, and he is informed that the property leased to him cannot be taken away
from him or his heirs, or from those into whose hands it may come, either by
inheritance, donation, sale or under any other title whatsoever. And in order
that the Imperial generosity may not be circumscribed, the Emperor can bestow
property forming part of his private domain in perpetuity to anyone in
possession of the same, if he desires to do so, whether the former has himself
obtained it directly from Us, or has acquired it by any other title, for to
relinquish payment of the rent is a favor which does not injure another, where
the Emperor desires him to be designated as the owner, who formerly held the
property under a perpetual lease.
And, indeed, if anyone should be found to have obtained any of Our land, not
under a perpetual lease but under a temporary one, by the authority of the
illustrious Count of Private Affairs, this circumstance will offer no obstacle
to the generosity of the Emperor if he should wish to transfer to another as a
donation what the party in possession had only leased for a specified time.
Again, if an increased rent should be offered by someone else for land of this
description, the first tenant to whom the property was temporarily leased will
have the right to retain the said land, if he offers as much as the other has
done. Where, however, he acquired the said property under a perpetual lease, he
shall remain in undisturbed possession of the same, as previously stated.
TITLE LXXI.
CONCERNING LESSEES AND AGENTS, OR COLLECTORS OF
LANDS BELONGING TO THE TREASURY OP THE IMPERIAL
HOUSEHOLD.
1. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Bassus, Prasto-rian Prefect.
Lessees and other persons employed on the lands of the Imperial household,
whenever any question arises with reference to the same requiring judicial
investigation, must either defend or bring lawsuits as all other persons are
legally required to do. And they shall not meddle with the business of other
litigants, or officiously protect them, even when authorized to do so by a
judicial decision, or, by turbulent and violent acts, dare to interfere with
the execution of the law.
Nor shall they busy themselves with any matters either public or private, nor
inform against any quiet household, lest they may afterwards repent of their
thoughtless pertinacity, for a severe penalty is imposed upon those who are
under Our immediate control, and are obliged to obey Our commands.
Given at Ravenna, on the day before the Nonesof March, during the Consulate of
Theodosius, Consul for the twelfth time, and Valentinian, Consul for the second
time.
TITLE LXXII.
WHAT PERSONS ARE NOT PERMITTED TO LEASE LANDS BELONGING TO THE TREASURY.
1. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Nestorius, Count of Private Affairs.
No Palatine, who is attached to Our private service, has authority to lease
property belonging to Our private domain, either in his own name or in that of
anyone else whomsoever, for We do not allow this to be done by one who is a
soldier or a decurion.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Vincentius
and Fravitta, 401.
TITLE LXXIII.
CONCERNING CONTRIBUTIONS IMPOSED UPON LANDS BELONGING TO THE TREASURY, TO THE
PRIVATE DOMAIN OF THE EMPEROR, TO THE STATE, OR TO TEMPLES.
1. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Firminus, Count of the Imperial
Largesses.
We grant permission to ordinary judges, as well as to the Governors of
provinces, to decide questions arising between the stewards or
lessees of Our private domain, but we reserve for the Receivers of Our Private
Treasury the right to collect any sums which may be due.
2. The Same Emperors to Messala.
Officers of the palace who have been given public letters by the illustrious
Count of Private Affairs for the purpose of assisting collectors of the
revenue, in order that the amounts due from the lands of Our private domain may
the more readily be paid, are hereby directed to perform their duty with the
greatest diligence, and if they should act rashly, they shall be reported by
the ordinary judges to Your Highness, so that they may be severely dealt with.
3. The Same Emperors.
All lands, not only those which, for a long time, have belonged to Our private
domain, but also those which have become the property of the Treasury through
confiscation, shall not be released from pecuniary obligations by virtue of any
privileges and exemptions of this kind; but notice is hereby given that every
species of contribution, tax, and imposition shall be required of them, and
collected without deduction.
TITLE LXXIV.
CONCERNING THE PRIVILEGES ENJOYED BY LANDS ATTACHED TO THE IMPERIAL HOUSEHOLD,
AND THOSE BELONGING TO THE PRIVATE DOMAIN OF THE EMPEROR, AND FROM WHAT
CONTRIBUTIONS THEY ARE EXEMPT.
1. The Emperor Constantine.
It is settled that lands belonging to Our private domain shall be exempt from
all ignoble services, nor shall the lessees of the same or the serfs attached
to them be subjected to any extraordinary impositions or additional charges.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of Placidus
and Romulus, 347.
2. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius.
For the sake of lightening the burdens of the people of the provinces, We
desire that Our private estates shall be liable to the same contribution that
all others are, but whenever grain is transported through places where it is
not usual to carry it, and where it can be conveyed through other uninhabited
regions, this rule will be violated, for the said grain should not be
transported where it will cause any inconvenience or loss to the inhabitants of
the provinces, hence, Your Excellency will cause it to be transported by the
same route that was formerly taken.
3. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius.
We order that the money paid as rent for lands belonging to Our private-domain,
which have been leased in perpetuity, shall, like those
of private individuals, be subject to the contributions imposed in behalf of
applications for admission to corporate bodies.
4. The Same Emperors to Asclepiodotus, Praetorian Prefect.
We, by no means, include among ignoble services the construction of public
highways, bridges, and works erected in honor of Our Imperial predecessors.
Therefore, no class of men, of whatever rank or dignity, shall be exempt from
assessments for the construction and repair of highways and bridges, and We
also include the Imperial palaces in the provision.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof March, during the
Consulate of Asclepiodotus and Marianus, 423.
5. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Flavian, Prse-torian Prefect.
We decree that all the possessors of land hereinbefore mentioned shall, without
any exception but the occupants of Our private domain, be liable to the
contributions prescribed, the revenues of which We have frequently set apart
for the requirements of the public welfare.
Given at Ravenna, on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate
of Bassus and Antiochus, 431.
TITLE LXXV. CONCERNING THE IMPERIAL STUD.
1. The Emperors Arcadius and Honoring to Csesarius, Praetorian Prefect.
All persons, from the highest to the lowest, are notified by an edict to be
published by Your Highness that they will be liable to a fine of a pound of
gold for every horse or mare, whether they are Hermo-genians or Palmates, which
they take away, unless they voluntarily restore them; and those who are proved
to have removed animals from any other drove shall be compelled to pay a fine
of six ounces of gold to Our Treasury.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Kalendsof December, during the
Consulate of Olybrius and Probinus, 395.
TITLE LXXVI. CONCERNING THE IMPERIAL PALACES AND BUILDINGS.
1. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to John,. Count of Private Affairs.
We except all buildings which are set apart for Us, that is to say, the
Imperial palaces, from the use and occupation of private persons.
TITLE LXXVII.
CYPRESS TREES FROM THE SACRED GROVES OF DAPHNE AND PERSEUS IN EGYPT SHALL NOT
BE CUT DOWN,
OR SOLD.
1. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Sylvanus, Count of Private Affairs.
If anyone should purchase cypress trees cut down in the sacred groves of Daphne
in Syria, or of Perseus in Egypt, he is notified that he will be fined five
pounds of gold; and he who dares to sell the trees, which no one is permitted
to purchase, shall be liable to the same penalty.
2. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Eudoxius, Prse-torian Prefect.
All judges, of whatever rank, are hereby notified that hereafter, without the
consent of Your Highness, permission will be refused them to cut down any trees
in the sacred grove of Daphne at Antioch, or even to remove such as have fallen
for any cause whatsoever. Nor can it be asserted by the Alytarch that he has
the right to cut down a single cypress, for the reason that he has planted
others.
And, lest it may appear that by denying him permission to cut down a cypress We
are depriving him of a privilege of long standing, without compensation, We
decree that he shall receive a pound of gold from Our Private Treasury for
every cypress which he was entitled to cut down, and anyone who violates this
law shall be condemned to pay a fine of fifty pounds of gold.
