THE THREE PREFACES OF THE CODE OF JUSTINIAN
FIRST PREFACE. CONCERNING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW CODE.
The Emperor Justinian to the Senate of the City of Constantinople. Those things
which seem to many former Emperors to require correction, but which none of
them ventured to carry into effect, We have decided to accomplish at the
present time with the assistance of Almighty God; and to diminish litigation by
the revision of the multitude of constitutions which are contained in the Three
Codes; namely, the Gregorian, the Hermogenian, and the Theodosian, as well as
in those other Codes promulgated after them by Theodosius of Divine Memory, and
by other Emperors, who succeeded him, in addition to those which We Ourselves
have promulgated, and to combine them in a single Code, under Our auspicious
name, in which compilation should be included not only the constitutions of the
three above-mentioned Codes, but also such new ones as subsequently have been
promulgated.
(1) Therefore, having in view the accomplishment of this extensive work, as
well as the maintenance of the public welfare, We have chosen, as being
competent for a task involving such labor and care, John, a most eminent man,
Ex-Quaestor of our Sacred Palace, and of consular, as well as patrician dignity;
Leontius, a man of the highest standing, an officer in the army, an Ex-
Praetorian Prefect, of consular and patrician dignity; Phocas, a most
illustrious man, an officer of the army, also of consular and patrician
dignity; Basilis, a most excellent man, Ex-Praetorian Prefect of the East, and
of patrician rank; Thomas, a most glorious man, Quaestor of our Sacred Palace,
and Ex-Consul; Tribonian, a distinguished man of great authority, and invested
with magisterial dignity; Constantine, an illustrious man, one of the Stewards
of Our bounty, Master of Requests, and of Our Judicial Inquiries; Theophilus, a
most eminent man, and one of the members of our Sacred Consistory, a Doctor of
Laws in this Fair City; and Dioscorous and Praesentinus, most learned jurists of
the Praetorian Tribunal.
(2) To these We have especially entrusted the suppression of superfluous
preambles, so far as this can be done without affecting the efficacy of the
laws, as well as of such enactments as are similar or contradictory, and, in
addition to this, the division of the laws; and it will be to the advantage to
omit such as have fallen into desuetude, to give expression in concise terms to
those which are included in the said three Codes, and in the New Constitutions,
and to place them under suitable titles, adding and omitting portions of the
same, and, indeed, changing their phraseology where convenience requires it.
bringing under one head enactments which are scattered through various
constitutions, and rendering their meaning clearer; so that the order of the
said constitutions may appear not only from the days and the consulate when
they were enacted, but also from their composition itself, by placing those
primarily published in the first place, and those which follow in the second.
And if any laws should be found in the three ancient codes without the date and
the name of the consul, or if any new constitutions have been inserted among
them, they should be so arranged that no doubt may arise with reference to
their general application, in such a way that rescripts addressed to certain
individuals, or originally issued by pragmatic sanction, may obtain the effect
of general constitutions, where, for the public welfare, they have been
included in a new code.
(3) Hence We have hastened to bring these matters to your notice, in order that
you may be informed to what an extent Our daily care is occupied with matters
having reference to the common welfare, by collecting such laws as are certain
and clear, and incorporating them into a single code, so that, by means of this
code, designated by Our auspicious name, the citation of the various
constitutions may cause decisions to be more readily rendered in all
litigation.
Given at Constantinople, on the Idesof February, during the reign and second
Consulship of the Emperor Justinian.
SECOND PREFACE.
CONCERNING THE CONFIRMATION OF THE CODE OF JUSTINIAN.
The maintenance of the integrity of the government depends upon two things,
namely, the force of arms and the observance of the laws: and, for this reason,
the fortunate race of the Romans obtained power and precedence over all other
nations in former times, and will do so forever, if God should be propitious;
since each of these has ever required the aid of the other, for, as military
affairs are rendered secure by the laws, so also are the laws preserved by
force of arms. Therefore, We have, with reason, directed Our attention, Our
aims, and Our labors, in the first place, to the maintenance of the public
welfare, and have corrected matters relating to the army in many ways, and thus
provided for everything; as We have by means of old laws not only brought
matters into a better condition, but We also have promulgated new laws, and by
Our just administration, or with additional expense, We have preserved those
already enacted, and afterwards by publishing new ones, have established them
most firmly for the obedience of Our subjects.
(1) But as it was necessary to reduce the vast number of the constitutions
contained in the three old codes, as well in the others compiled in former
times, and to clear up their obscurity by means of proper definitions, We have
applied Ourselves with willing mind to the accomplishment of this work for the
common good; and, after having
selected men conspicuous for their legal learning and ability, as well as for
their experience in business, and tireless zeal for the interests of the State,
We have committed this great task to them under certain limitations, and have
directed them to collect into a single code, to be designated by Our auspicious
name, the constitutions of the three ancient codes, namely the Gregorian,
Hermogenian, and Theodosian compilations, as well as all those subsequently
promulgated by Theodosius of Divine Memory, and the other princes who have
succeeded him; together with such constitutions as have been issued during Our
reign; and to see that any preambles which are not confirmed by subsequent
decrees, and any constitutions which are contradictory, or should be
suppressed, as well as such as have been repealed by others of later date, or
which are of the same character  except those which, by conferring upon them
Our sanction to a certain extent, We have considered to be susceptible of
division, and by such division of these ancient laws some new principle may
appear to arise.
In addition to all this, many other matters relative to the composition of this
Code have been placed by Our authority in the hands of these most wise men; and
Almighty God has afforded this protection through Our zeal for the welfare of
the State.
(2) The following persons have been chosen for this work, and the completion of
a task of such importance, namely: that most excellent man, John, Ex-Quaestor of
Our Palace, and of consular and patrician dignity; as well as that most eminent
man, Leontius, Ex-Praetorian Prefect, of consular and patrician dignity; and
also the most distinguished Phocas, officer of the army, also of consular and
patrician dignity; and that most accomplished man of patrician dignity,
Basilis, Ex-Praetorian Prefect of the East, now Praetorian Prefect of Illyria;
also, the most illustrious Thomas, Quaestor of our Sacred Palace and Ex-Consul;
and the eminent Tribonian, of exalted magisterial dignity; the distinguished
Constantine, Steward of Our Imperial Largesses, Master of Requests, and of
Judicial Inquiries; Theophilus, former magistrate and Doctor of Laws in this
Fair City; as well as those most learned jurists, Dioscorus and Praesentinus,
members of your bar; and all that We have directed them to do, they with God's
assistance have, through assiduous and untiring industry, brought to a
successful conclusion, and offered to Us this new, systematically arranged
Justinian Code, compiled in such a manner as to contribute to the common
benefit, and meet the requirements of Our Empire.
(3) Therefore We have had in view the perpetual validity of this Code in your
tribunal, in order that all litigants, as well as the most accomplished
advocates, may know that it is lawful for them, under no circumstances, to cite
constitutions from the three ancient codes, of which mention has just been
made, or from those which at the present time are styled the New Constitutions,
in any judicial inquiry or contest; but that they are required to use only the
constitutions which are included in this Our Code, and that those who venture
to act otherwise will be liable to the crime of forgery; as the citation
of the said constitutions of Our Code, with the opinions of the ancient
interpreters of the law, will be sufficient for the disposal of all cases. No
doubt as to their validity should arise where any of them appears without a
date and without the name of the consul, or because they may have been
addressed to certain private individuals; as there can be no question whatever
that all have the force of general constitutions; and even if there should be
some of them from which anything has been taken, or to which anything has been
added, or which have been changed in certain respects (which We have specially
permitted the most excellent men aforesaid to do), We grant to no one the right
to cite the said constitutions, as they are stated in the books of the ancient
authorities, but merely to mention the opinions of the latter, as being of
legal effect when they are not opposed to the constitutions of this Our Code.
(4) Moreover, the pragmatic sanctions that are not included in Our Code, and
which have been granted to cities, corporate bodies, bureaus, offices, or
private individuals, shall remain in every respect valid, if they concede any
privilege as a special favor; but where they have been promulgated for the
settlement of some legal point We direct that they shall only hold when not
opposed to the provisions of Our Code. But in any matter which comes before
your tribunal, or in any other civil or military proceeding, or in one which
has reference to accounts forming part of the public expenses, or in such as
have any relation to the public welfare, We decree that they shall remain valid
as far as public convenience may require this to be done.
(5) Therefore let your illustrious and sublime authority, actuated by a desire
for the common good, and with zeal for the execution of Our orders, cause
information of this Code to be communicated to all peoples, by the promulgation
of an edict in the customary way, and by sending into each province, subject to
Our Empire, a copy bearing Our signature, so that in this manner the
constitutions of this Our Code may be brought to the knowledge of all persons;
and that during festival days, that is to say, from the sixteenth day of the
Kalendsof May of the seventh current indiction, and during the consulate of
that most illustrious man Decius, citations of the constitutions shall be made
from this Our Code.
Given at Constantinople, on the sixth of the Idesof April, during the Consulate
of the illustrious Decius.
THIRD PREFACE.
CONCERNING THE AMENDMENTS OF THE CODE OP OUR LORD JUSTINIAN, AND THE SECOND
EDITION OF THE
SAME.
Our heart, Conscript Fathers, always induces Us to pay the strictest attention
to matters concerning the public welfare, so that nothing which has been begun
by Us may be left imperfect. Therefore, in the beginning of Our reign, we
formed the design of collecting in a single
body the Imperial Constitutions which were scattered through several volumes,
and the most of which were either repetitions or conflicting, and free them
from every defect. This work has now been perfected by certain most
distinguished and learned men, and has been subsequently confirmed by Us, as is
shown by Our two Constitutions prefixed hereto.
(1) But after We decreed that the ancient law should be observed, We rendered
fifty decisions, and promulgated several constitutions relative to the
advantages to be derived from the proposed work, by means of which the majority
of the former enactments were amended and abridged; and We divested all the
ancient law of superfluous prolixity, and then inserted the same in Our
Institutes and Digest.
(2) But, as Our new decisions and constitutions, which were promulgated after
the completion of Our Code, were distinct from the body of the same, and seemed
to demand our care and attention, and as some of them, which were afterwards
inserted, appeared to require alteration or correction, it seemed to Us
necessary to have the said constitutions revised by that eminent man Tribonian,
Ex-Quaestor and Ex-Consul, the authorized minister of our work; and also by the
illustrious Dorotheus, Quaestor and Doctor of Laws of Berytus; and, in addition
to these Menna, Constantine, and John, most eloquent men, and distinguished
advocates of the bar of this City, who were ordered to divide said
constitutions into separate chapters for the purpose of rendering them more
available; to place them under proper titles; and to add them to those
constitutions which had preceded them.
, (3) We permitted the aforesaid distinguished and most learned jurists to do
all these things, and when there was need of any correction, allowed them to
make it without hesitation, relying upon Our authority; and where any of the
constitutions were superfluous, or had been annulled by any of Our subsequent
decrees; or where they were found to be similar or conflicting, to remove and
separate them from the compilation of the Code itself; as well as to complete
such as were imperfect, and to bring to light those that were shrouded in
obscurity, so that not only the way of the Institutes and the Digest might
appear clear and open, but also that the splendor of the Constitutions of Our
Code might be manifest to all, and no constitution which resembled another, or
was contradictory or useless, should be retained, and no one should have any
doubt that what was confirmed by the revision was both valid and sufficiently
perspicuous. For, in the ancient Books, the authorities of former times not
only called the first, but also the second editions, revisions; which can be
readily ascertained from the works of that eminent jurist Ulpianus, on Sabinus,
by those who desire to know.
(4) These things having been accomplished according to Our intention, and the
Justinian Code having been purified and elucidated by the aforesaid most
illustrious and learned men (all of this having been done in compliance with
Our order, and the work offered to Us with its amplifications, and changes), We
ordered that it should be copied in accordance with the second edition, and not
in accordance
with the first, but as it was revised; and, by Our authority, We directed that
it alone should be used in all tribunals, whenever the Divine Constitutions
were applicable, from the fourth day of the Kalendsof January of the most
auspicious Consulate of Ourself and that illustrious man Paulinus; and that no
constitution not contained in this Our Code should be cited, unless in the
course of events some new question may arise which requires Our decision. For,
if something better should be found hereafter, and it becomes necessary to
revise a constitution, no one will doubt that We should do so, and incorporate
into another compilation those laws which are designated by the name New
Constitutions.
(5) Therefore, having repeated Our order that We shall permit none hereafter to
quote anything from Our decisions, or from other constitutions, which We have
previously promulgated, or from the first edition of the Justinian Code; but
that only what may be found written in this Our present purified and amended
Code shall be regarded as authority, and cited in all tribunals, We have
ordered it to be transcribed without any ambiguity, as was done in the case of
Our Institutes and Digest, so that everything which has been compiled by Us
shall be clear and intelligible, not only in the chirography, but also in the
laws themselves, although on this account the matter contained in this Code has
been considerably extended.
(6) Therefore, Most Reverend and Illustrious Fathers, in order that Our labors
may become manifest to you and obtain authority through all time, We have
presented this collection of laws to your most distinguished Order.
Given at Constantinople, on the seventeenth day of the Kalendsof December,
during the Consulate of Our Lord Justinian, for the fourth time Consul, and of
Paulus.
THE CODE OF OUR LORD THE MOST SACRED EMPEROR JUSTINIAN.
SECOND EDITION. BOOK I.
TITLE I.
CONCERNING THE MOST EXALTED TRINITY AND THE
CATHOLIC FAITH, AND PROVIDING THAT No ONE
SHALL DARE TO PUBLICLY OPPOSE THEM.
1. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to the people of the City
of Constantinople.
We desire that all peoples subject to Our benign Empire shall live under the
same religion that the Divine Peter, the Apostle, gave to the Romans, and which
the said religion declares was introduced by himself, and which it is well
known that the Pontiff Damasus, and Peter, Bishop of Alexandria, a man of
apostolic sanctity, embraced; that is to say, in accordance with the rules of
apostolic discipline and the evangelical doctrine, we should believe that the
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit constitute a single Deity, endowed with equal
majesty, and united in the Holy Trinity.
(1) We order all those who follow this law to assume the name of Catholic
Christians, and considering others as demented and insane, We order that they
shall bear the infamy of heresy; and when the Divine vengeance which they merit
has been appeased, they shall afterwards be punished in accordance with Our
resentment, which we have acquired from the judgment of Heaven.
Dated at Thessalonica, on the third of the Kalendsof March, during the
Consulate of Gratian, Consul for the fifth time, and Theodosius.
2. The Same Emperors to Eutropius, Praetorian Prefect.
Let no place be afforded to heretics for the conduct of their ceremonies, and
let no occasion be offered for them to display the insanity of their obstinate
minds. Let all persons know that if any privilege has been fraudulently
obtained by means of any rescript whatsoever, by persons of this kind, it will
not be valid. Let all bodies of heretics be prevented from holding unlawful
assemblies, and let the name of the only and the greatest God be celebrated
everywhere, and let the observance of the Nicene Creed, recently transmitted by
Our ancestors, and firmly established by the testimony and practice of Divine
Religion, always remain secure.
(1) Moreover, he who is an adherent of the Nicene Faith, and a true believer in
the Catholic religion, should be understood to be one
who believes that Almighty God and Christ, the Son of God, are one person, God
of God, Light of Light; and let no one, by rejection, dishonor the Holy Spirit,
whom we expect, and have received from the Supreme Parent of all things, in
whom the sentiment of a pure and undefiled faith flourishes, as well as the
belief in the undivided substance of a Holy Trinity, which true believers
indicate by the Greek wordo9moo/usiov. These things, indeed, do not require
further proof, and should be respected.
(2) Let those who do not accept these doctrines cease to apply the name of true
religion to their fraudulent belief; and let them be branded with their open
crimes, and, having been removed from the threshhold of all churches, be
utterly excluded from them, as We forbid all heretics to hold unlawful
assemblies within cities. If, however, any seditious outbreak should be
attempted, We order them to be driven outside the walls of the City, with
relentless violence, and We direct that all Catholic churches, throughout the
entire world, shall be placed under the control of the orthodox bishops who
have embraced the Nicene Creed.
Given at Constantinople, on the fourth of the Idesof January, under the
Consulate of Flavius Eucharius and Flavius Syagrius.
3. The Emperor Martian to Palladius, Praetorian Prefect.
No one, whether he belongs to the clergy, the army, or to any other condition
of men, shall, with a view to causing a tumult and giving occasion to
treachery, attempt to discuss the Christian religion publicly in the presence
of an assembled and listening crowd; for he commits an injury against the most
reverend Synod who publicly contradicts what has once been decided and properly
established; as those matters relative to the Christian Faith have been settled
by the priests who met at Chalcedony by Our order, and are known to be in
conformity with the apostolic explanations and conclusions of the three hundred
and eight Holy Fathers assembled in Nicea, and the hundred and fifty who met in
this Imperial City; for the violators of this law shall not go unpunished,
because they not only oppose the true faith, but they also profane its
venerated mysteries by engaging in contests of this kind with Jews and Pagans.
Therefore, if any person who has ventured to publicly discuss religious matters
is a member of the clergy, he shall be removed from his order; if he is a
member of the army, he shall be degraded; and any others who are guilty of this
offence, who are freemen, shall be banished from this most Sacred City, and
shall be subjected to the punishment prescribed by law according to the power
of the court; and if they are slaves, they shall undergo the severest penalty.
Given at Constantinople, on the eighth of the Idesof February, under the
consulship of Patricius.
4. John, Bishop of the City of Rome, to his most Illustrious and Merciful Son
Justinian.
Among the conspicuous reasons for praising your wisdom and gentleness, Most
Christian of Emperors, and one which radiates light
as a star, is the fact that through love of the Faith, and actuated by zeal for
charity, you, learned in ecclesiastical discipline, have preserved reverence
for the See of Rome, and have subjected all things to its authority, and have
given it unity. The following precept was communicated to its founder, that is
to say, the first of the Apostles, by the mouth of the Lord, namely: "Feed my
lambs."
This See is indeed the head of all churches, as the rules of the Fathers and
the decrees of Emperors assert, and the words of your most reverend piety
testify. It is therefore claimed that what the Scriptures state, namely, "By Me
Kings reign, and the Powers dispense justice;" will be accomplished in you. For
there is nothing which shines with a more brilliant lustre than genuine faith
when displayed by a prince, since there is nothing which prevents destruction
as true religion does, for as both of them have reference to the Author of Life
and Light, they disperse darkness and prevent apostasy. Wherefore, Most
Glorious of Princes, the Divine Power is implored by the prayers of all to
preserve your piety in this ardor for the Faith, in this devotion of your mind,
and in this zeal for true religion, without failure, during your entire
existence. For we believe that this is for the benefit of the Holy Churches, as
it was written, "The king rules with his lips," and again, "The heart of the
King is in the hand of God, and it will incline to whatever side God wishes";
that is to say, that He may confirm your empire, and maintain your kingdoms for
the peace of the Church and the unity of religion; guard their authority, and
preserve him in that sublime tranquillity which is so grateful to him; and no
small change is granted by the Divine Power through whose agency a divided
church is not afflicted by any griefs or subject to any reproaches. For it is
written, "A just king, who is upon his throne, has no reason to apprehend any
misfortune."
We have received with all due respect the evidences of your serenity, through
Hypatius and Demetrius, most holy men, my brothers and fellow-bishops, from
whose statements we have learned that you have promulgated an Edict addressed
to your faithful people, and dictated by your love of the Faith, for the
purpose of overthrowing the designs of heretics, which is in accordance with
the evangelical tenets, and which we have confirmed by our authority with the
consent of our brethren and fellow bishops, for the reason that it is in
conformity with the apostolic doctrine.
The following is the text of the letter of the Emperor Justinian, Victorious,
Pious, Happy, Renowned, Triumphant, always Augustus, to John, Patriarch, and
most Holy Archbishop of the fair City of Rome:
With honor to the Apostolic See, and to Your Holiness, which is, and always has
been remembered in Our prayers, both now and formerly, and honoring your
happiness, as is proper in the case of one who is considered as a father, We
hasten to bring to the knowledge of Your Holiness everything relating to the
condition of the Church, as We have always had the greatest desire to preserve
the unity of your Apostolic See, and the condition of the Holy Churches of God,
as they
exist at the present time, that they may remain without disturbance or
opposition. Therefore, We have exerted Ourselves to unite all the priests of
the East and subject them to the See of Your Holiness, and hence the questions
which have at present arisen, although they are manifest and free from doubt,
and, according to the doctrine of your Apostolic See, are constantly firmly
observed and preached by all priests, We have still considered it necessary
that they should be brought to the attention of Your Holiness. For we do not
suffer anything which has reference to the state of the Church, even though
what causes the difficulty may be clear and free from doubt, to be discussed
without being brought to the notice of Your Holiness, because you are the head
of all the Holy Churches, for We shall exert Ourselves in every way (as has
already been stated), to increase the honor and authority of your See.
(1) Therefore, We present to Your Holiness the fact that certain infidels and
persons who do not belong to the Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church of God
have, like Jews and apostates, dared to dispute matters which are properly
accepted, glorified, and preached by all priests in accordance with your
doctrines, denying that Our Lord Jesus Christ is the only begotten Son of God,
and that Our Lord was born of the Holy Spirit and of the Holy, Glorious, and
always Virgin Mary, the Mother of God, and became a man and was crucified, and
that he is one of the persons of the Holy Trinity, who are all of one
substance, and who should be adored and exalted along with the Father and the
Holy Spirit, and that he is consubstantial with the Father according to
divinity, and consubstantial with ourselves according to humanity, and
susceptible of. the sufferings of the flesh, but not susceptible of the same as
a deity. For these persons refusing to acknowledge Our Lord Jesus Christ as the
only begotten Son of God, and Our Lord as one of the Holy Trinity, and of the
same substance with the other persons composing it, appear to follow the evil
doctrine of Nestor, who asserts that there is one Son of God according to
grace, whom he styles the Word of God, and another Son whom he calls Christ.
(2) All the priests of the Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church and the most
Reverend Abbots of the Holy Monasteries, acknowledging Your Holiness, and
solicitous for the prosperity and unity of the Holy Churches of God, which they
receive from the Apostolic See of Your Holiness, making no changes in the
ecclesiastical condition which has existed up to this time, and still exists;
with one voice, confess, glorify, and preach that Our Lord Jesus Christ is the
only begotten Son and the Word of God, and that Our Lord, born of His Father
before all centuries and times, Who descended from Heaven in the last days, was
born of the Holy Spirit and the Holy and Glorious Virgin Mary, the Mother of
God; became a man and was crucified; is of the same substance as the Holy
Trinity to be adored and glorified with the Father and the Holy Spirit; for we
do not acknowledge any other God, Word or Christ, but one alone, and the same
of like substance with the Father, in accordance with divinity, and of like
substance with us in accordance with humanity, Who could suffer in the flesh,
but could not suffer as a deity; and Whom, Himself perfect in divinity as well
as humanity, we receive and confess as being what the Greeks callo9moo/usiov.
And, as the only begotten Son and Word of God was born of His Father before
centuries and times existed, and as He, in later times, descended from Heaven,
was born of the Holy Spirit and the Holy ever Virgin Mary, the Mother of God,
Our Lord Jesus Christ having become a man, is properly and truly God. Hence we
say that the Holy and Glorious Virgin Mary is properly and truly the Mother of
God, not for the reason that God obtained speech and origin from her, but
because in the last days He descended from Heaven, and, incarnated through Her,
became a man, and was born; whom we confess and believe (as has already been
stated), to be of the same substance with the Father according to deity, and of
the same substance with ourselves according to humanity, whose miracles and
sufferings voluntarily sustained by Him while in the flesh we acknowledge.
(3) Moreover, we recognize four Sacred Councils, that is to say, the one
composed of three hundred and eighteen Holy Fathers who assembled in the City
of Nicea; and that of the hundred and fifty Holy Fathers who met in this
Imperial City; and that of the Holy Fathers who first congregated at Ephesus;
and that of the Holy Fathers who met at Chalcedony, as your Apostolic See
teaches and proclaims. Hence, all priests who follow the doctrine of your
Apostolic See believe, confess, and preach these things.
(4) Wherefore We have hastened to bring to the notice of Your Holiness, through
the most blessed Bishops Hypatius and Demetrius (so it may not be concealed
from Your Holiness), that these tenets are denied by some few wicked and
judaizing monks, who have adopted the perfidious doctrines of Nestor.
(5) Therefore We request your paternal affection, that you, by your letters,
inform Us and the Most Holy Bishop of this Fair City, and your brother the
Patriarch, who himself has written by the same messengers to Your Holiness,
eager in all things to follow the Apostolic See of Your Blessedness, in order
that you may make it clear to Us that Your Holiness acknowledges all the
matters which have been set forth above, and condemns the perfidy of those who,
in the manner of Jews, have dared to deny the true Faith. For in this way the
love of all persons for you, and the authority of your See will increase, and
the unity of the Holy Church will be preserved unimpaired, when all the most
blessed bishops learn through you and from those who have been dispatched by
you, the true doctrines of Your Holiness. Moreover, We beg Your Blessedness to
pray for Us, and to obtain the beneficence of God in Our behalf.
The subscription was as follows: "May God preserve you for many years, Most
Holy and Religious Father."
HERE FOLLOWS THE REMAINDER OF THE LETTER OP THE POPE.
It is then clear, Most Glorious Emperor (as the tenor of your message and the
statements of your envoys disclose), that you have de-
voted Yourself to the study of apostolic learning, as You are familiar with,
have written, proposed and published to believers among the people, those
matters having reference to the faith of the Catholic religion, which (as we
have already stated), both the tenets of the Apostolic See and the venerated
authority of the Holy Fathers have established, and which, in all respects, we
have confirmed. Therefore, it is opportune to cry out with a prophetic voice,
"Heaven will rejoice with You, and pour out its blessings upon You, and the
mountains will rejoice, and the hills be glad with exceeding joy." Hence, you
should write these things upon the tablets of Your heart, and preserve them as
the apples of your eyes, for there is no one animated by the charity of Christ
who will appear to impugn this confession of the just and true faith; as it is
evident that You condemn the impiety of Nestor and Eutyches, and all other
heretics, and that You firmly and inviolably, with devotion to God and reverent
mind acknowledge the single, true, and Catholic Faith of Our Lord God, as
revealed by the agency of Our Savior Jesus Christ; diffused everywhere by the
preaching of the Prophets and Apostles; confirmed by the confessions of saints
throughout the entire world, and united with the opinions of the Fathers and
Doctors conformably to our doctrine.
Those alone who are opposed to your professions are they of whom the Holy
Scriptures speak as follows: "They have based their hope on lying, and have
expected to remain concealed through falsehood." And also those who, according
to the prophet, say to the Lord, "Depart from us, we are unwilling to follow
your ways"; on account of which Solomon said, "They have wandered through the
paths of their own cultivation and gathered unfruitful things with their
hands." This, then, is your true faith, this your true religion, which all the
Fathers and heads of the Roman Church of happy memory (as we have already
stated) and whom we follow in all things, have embraced; this is what the
Apostolic See has preached up to this time, and has preserved inviolate, and if
anyone should appear to oppose this confession, and this Faith, he must show
himself to be outside of the communion and the Catholic Church. We have found
Cyrus and his followers in the City of Rome, who came from the Cumitensian
monastery, and whom we have attempted by our apostolic arguments to recall to
the true faith, as sheep who are about to perish and are wandering, should be
brought back to the fold of the owner. In order that, according to the prophet,
stammering tongues may know how to speak matters which have reference to peace,
the first of our apostles quotes the words of Isaiah, the prophet, through us
to unbelievers, namely: "Continue in the light of the fire and the flame which
you yourselves have kindled, but their heart is so hardened (as has been
written), that they do not recognize the voice of the Shepherd, and the sheep
which were not mine are unwilling to hear." With reference to such persons, we,
observing what was established by the Pontiff on this point, do not receive
them in our communion, and we order them to be excluded from every Catholic
Church, unless, having renounced their errors, they adopt our doctrine, and
announce their
adherence to it, after having made a regular profession of the same. For it is
just that those who do not show obedience to the laws which we have established
should be banished from the churches. But as the Church never closes her heart
to those who return to her, I beseech Your Clemency, if they, having renounced
their errors and abandoned their wicked designs, should wish to return to the
bosom of the Church, to receive them in your communion, and abandon your
feelings of indignation, and that through our intercession you pardon them, and
grant them your indulgence.
Moreover, we pray God and Our Saviour Jesus Christ, that he may preserve you
long in peace in this true religion and in the unity and veneration of the
Apostolic See, and that your most Christian and pious Empire may, in all
respects, long be maintained. Moreover, 0 most Serene of Princes, we praise
Hypatius and Demetrius, your envoys, and our brothers and fellow-bishops, whose
selection has shown that they are acceptable to Your Clemency; for the
importance of such an embassy indicates that it could not be entrusted to
anyone who is not perfect in Christ, and that You would not have deemed them
worthy of a mission involving so much piety and reverence, unless they have
been very dear to You.
The favor of Our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God the Father, and the
Communion of the Holy Spirit, remain forever with you, Most Pious son. Amen."
The subscription was as follows, "Most Glorious and Clement Son of the Emperor
Augustus, may Almighty God guard your kingdom and your health with His eternal
protection."
Given at Rome, on the eighth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of
the Emperor Justinian, Consul for the fourth time, and of Paulinus, Consul for
the fifth time.

1. The Emperor Constantine to the People.
Let everyone, at the time of his death, have the liberty to leave any portion
of his property that he chooses to a most holy and venerable Catholic
congregation, and let his dispositions not be set aside; for there is nothing
to which men are more entitled than to have free power to exert their last
will, as afterwards they cannot do so, and let them be unrestrained, for the
right exercised then does not return.
Given at Rome, on the fifth of the Nonesof July during the Consulate of Crispus
and Constantine-Caesar, each Consul for the second time, 321.

2. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Pancratius, Urban
Prefect.
Let no one think that he has permission to bury human bodies in churches
consecrated to the apostles or martyrs.
Given at Heraclea, on the third of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate
of Eucharius and Syagrius, 381.

3. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius.

and Evodius, 386.

4. The Same, to Nicenus, Praetorian Prefect.
Let no more than nine hundred and fifty canons be appointed for the Church of
this great City, and let no one have the power to add to their number, or to
change it, or to substitute others for those who may die; and let none of those
of this body who exceed the abovementioned number and have been appointed
through patronage, and have been denied the right of innovation, claim those
things which have been bestowed upon the Holy Church by way of honor, or as
necessary privileges.
Given at Eudoxiopolis, on the seventh of the Kalendsof September, during the
Consulate of Honorius, Consul for the eighth time, and Theodosius Junior,
Consul for the third time, 409.

5. The Same, to Melitius, Praetorian Prefect.
It is decided, after proper consideration, to severely restrict the charges
from which churches of different cities shall be held especially exempt; and,
in the first place, no injury shall be inflicted by usurpation, and no lands
dedicated to the uses of the secrets of Heaven shall be soiled with the filth
of base exaction. Nor shall any extraordinary tax be levied, nor a
supplementary one be imposed; nor shall any desire for their transfer to the
Treasury in default of taxes be manifested. And, finally, no burden shall be
imposed upon its functions, beyond that payable under the Canon Law, and such
as sudden necessities or contingencies demand.
If anyone violates this law, he shall be condemned to perpetual exile or
deportation, after having undergone the punishment prescribed for sacrilege.
Given at Ravenna, on the eighth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of
Honorius, Consul for the ninth time, and Theodosius, Consul for the fifth time,
412.

6. The Same, to Philip, Prefect of Illyria.
All innovation having been abolished, We command that ancient custom and the
former ecclesiastical canons which have been in force up to this time shall be
observed through all the provinces of Illyria; and if any doubt should arise
with reference to them, it must be removed by the knowledge of the Holy Law
possessed by that most reverend man, the Patriarch of the Church of the City of
Constantinople (which enjoys the prerogatives of Ancient Rome), and the
judgment of the ecclesiastical assembly of that City.
Given on the day before the Idesof July, during the Consulate of Eustachius and
Agricola, 421.

7. The Same to Asclepiodotus, Praetorian Prefect.
We freely place the care of the Divine Houses and Venerable Churches in the
same honorable class with that of highways and bridges, because these are not
included among base employments.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof March, during the
Consulate of Asclepiodotus and Marinian, 423.

8. The Emperor Cams to Praesidorus, Praetorian Prefect.
Let the Sacred Church of the City of Thessalonica know clearly that it is,
through Our indulgence, released from the payment of its own capitation tax;
but that it should not injure the State by abusing the ecclesiastical name, in
order to prevent the payment of taxes due from others.
Given at Constantinople, on the sixth of the Idesof October, during the fifth
consulate of Victor, 424.

9. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinum to Cyrus, Prefect of the City.
We believe that the frauds of those who, under the pretext of their official
position as canons, or members of other religious bodies, whose duties they do
not perform, attempt to evade the charges imposed upon them, should be
prevented; therefore, let no one be excused from other duties, under the
pretext of some employment which he does not discharge, in order that bankers
or money brokers may not refuse to perform the functions of their calling by
representing themselves as members of ecclesiastical bodies, or canons.
Therefore, if any such person gives himself the mere appellation of the member
of an ecclesiastical body, or a canon, let him know that another will be
appointed in his place, who will be qualified to discharge the aforesaid
employment; and that the substitution of those previously mentioned, or of any
who may die, cannot be made except with the consent of the superior of him who
is substituted; and that from this date, no one can be excused through
reverence for the Holy Church.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Theodosius,
Consul for the seventeenth time, and Festus, 439.

10. The Same, to Florentius, Praetorian Prefect.
We order that no ship having more than the capacity of two thousand measures of
grain shall be excused from the transport of public property, or be released
from the public service, either through the privilege of rank enjoyed by the
owner, or on account of some personal privilege, or through respect for
religion; nor any Imperial decree be cited, or any rescript or pragmatic
sanction be put forward as an excuse for not obeying this most wise law.
This rule We desire to be observed in all cases, so that, generally speaking,
if anything of this kind is advanced against the law or the public welfare, in
any matter whatsoever, it shall not be valid. When any attempt whatever to
evade this law is made, We shall punish it with the confiscation of the ship
whose owner was excused.
Given under the Consulate of Theodosius, Consul for the seventeenth time, and
Festus, 439.

11. The Same, to Taurus, Praetorian Prefect.
We order that no one shall be excused from furnishing couriers, horses, and
vehicles, or from any other duty, when it is usual for similar service to be
furnished during Our journey through all Our provinces, wherever We may stop,
even though these possessions may belong to the Holy Churches.
Given at Constantinople, on the thirteenth day of the Kalendsof March, during
the Consulate of the Emperor Valentinian, Consul for the fifth time, and
Anatolius, 440.

12. The Emperors Valentinian and Martian to Palladius, Praetorian Prefect.
We decree that the privileges conceded by former Emperors under the general
terms of constitutions, to all the Holy Churches of the orthodox religion,
shall be observed, and remain firm and unimpaired for all time.
(1) We command that all pragmatic sanctions which are contrary to
ecclesiastical canons and have been obtained through favor or political
intrigue, shall be deprived of all their force and authority.
(2) And, for the reason that it becomes Our humanity to provide for those who
are poor, and to use Our efforts to prevent indigent persons from wanting food;
We order that those things of different kinds which up to this time have been
furnished the Holy Churches but of the public property shall remain unaltered,
and shall not hereafter be diminished; and We hereby confirm this liberality
for all time.
Given during the consulate of Aêtius and Studius, 454.
The New Constitution of The Emperor Frederick.
We order that it shall be promulgated throughout Italy that all laws and
customs which are contrary to the liberties of the Church and its ministers, as
well as such as are opposed to the Canon and Imperial laws, shall be null and
void; and this New Constitution directs that they be entirely removed from the
capitularies, and it decrees besides that similar enactments shall not be valid
in law. When anything is done in violation of this, the parties shall incur the
penalties prescribed. If, however, during the year following the publication of
this new Constitution, anyone should violate it, their property throughout our
entire Empire may be seized by anyone with impunity.

13. The Same, to Palladius, Praetorian Prefect.
We decree by the following general law, that if a widow, a deaconess, or a
virgin consecrated to God, or any other good woman, or one mentioned under any
other title of religious honor or dignity, believes that she has left either by
her will or codicil (which, however, should be executed with all legal
formalities), anything either entirely or in part to a church, or a shrine
dedicated to a martyr, or to a clerk, a
monk, or to the poor, her bequest shall, under all circumstances, remain valid
and permanent, whether it was left by the appointment of an heir, or by a
substitution, or as a legacy, or under a general or a special trust, or by a
nuncupative or written will, in order that no doubt may hereafter arise with
reference to matters of this kind.
Given at Constantinople, on the tenth of the Kalendsof May, during the
Consulate of Athemius and Valentinian, 455.
Extracts from Novel 5, Chapter V. Latin Text.
Persons who enter monasteries, at the time of their entrance consecrate
themselves and their property to God, and therefore they cannot dispose of it
by will, for the reason that they are no longer its owners.
Extracts from Novel 123, Chapter XXXVIII. Latin Text.
When any man or woman without children chooses a monastic life, and enters a
monastery, We order that the monastery into which they enter shall be entitled
to his or her property.
If any such person has children, and enters a monastery before dividing his
property among them, he can do so afterwards, without diminishing their lawful
shares, and anything which he does not bestow upon them shall belong to the
monastery. If, however, he should wish to divide his entire estate among his
children, he should include himself with them, and retain as their father the
share to which the monastery would be entitled. But if he should die after
having entered the monastery, and before he has divided his property among his
children, they shall be entitled to their lawful shares, and the remainder of
the estate shall belong to the monastery.

14. The Emperors Leo and Anthemius to Armasius, Praetorian Prefect.
We order that no archbishop who may hereafter preside over the Holy Orthodox
Church in this Imperial City, or any official to whom the administration of
ecclesiastical property has been entrusted, shall have the power, by any kind
of alienation whatsoever, to transfer to any person any lands or real estate
(either in the city or the country), in short, any immovable property, or any
serfs attached to said lands, or any slaves, or any testamentary annuities, or
any donations made by a living person to a church. The said lands, however, can
be divided, cultivated, increased and amplified, but no one can convey to
another any interest in them.
If, however, anyone should desire that his patrimony, or any portion of the
same, which consists of land with or without houses, or of revenues, slaves,
tenants, and the peculiumof the latter, shall belong to the above-mentioned
venerable church, and manifest his intention either by a will or a codicil,
executed according to law, or by a nuncupative will, or by a legacy, a trust, a
donation mortis causa,or any other final disposition of the property, or by
means of a donation inter vivos,or by a contract of sale, gift, or other title,
his disposition of the same shall be valid, and remain unaltered.
Let them know that, under no circumstances, and at no time, shall they be
prevented from disposing of their property under the pretext of liberality or
gratitude, or from alienating it to persons who are willing to purchase the
same, provided all members of the clergy, including the bishop and the steward,
consent to the alienation of said property; for it is proper to preserve
reverently and intact all rights which now or may hereafter belong to the Most
Blessed Church, just as religiously as the Holy Church itself, for as the
mother of religion and faith is herself perpetual, so her patrimony should
remain entire and uninjured for all time.
(1) It is clear that if any steward of the Church or other person should, with
audacious spirit and sacrilegious intent, venture to violate this law of Ours,
and attempt to acquire or hold with shameless insolence any ecclesiastical
lands acquired under the title of donation, purchase, exchange, or any other
contract (unless in the manner which We have now established), he shall lose
all the fruit of his own boldness, and any price or privilege which, for the
sake of favor, may have been given to the said official, or to any other person
whomsoever; and it shall be acquired for the profit and the advantage of the
Church. Again, any lands which have been obtained in any of these ways by
clerks themselves, or temporal stewards, along with their profits, shall be
demanded with their rents or accessories for the entire intermediate time, just
as if the property had not been purchased or sold; for the reason that whatever
is done contrary to law is considered as not having been done at all.
(2) Any steward who has done anything of this kind, or, indeed, permitted it to
be done, whether by sale, donation, or exchange (except in the way which we
have permitted by the present law), or, finally, who has given his consent to
any kind of an alienation, shall be deprived of the administration which has
been entrusted to him; and any loss which the Church has sustained shall be
repaired out of his property, and his heirs, successors, and descendants shall
be liable to an action brought by a competent person appointed by
ecclesiastics, whether the damage was caused by his own act, or merely by his
acquiescence.
(3) Notaries, who have dared to draw up instruments containing forbidden
contracts of this kind, shall be punished with the penalty of perpetual exile.
(4) Judges who have jurisdiction of such matters, and who confirm donations or
forbidden contracts of this kind, shall be condemned to lose their office and
their property.
(5) And that it may not appear that every method and opportunity of obtaining
benefits for the Church have been taken away from religious stewards, We give
them permission to proceed cautiously with reference to things which, for the
most part, are considered to be useful. Therefore, when a steward belonging to
the clergy has a view to the interest of the Church of this Imperial City, and
wishes that the temporal usufruct of certain possessions and estates, either
urban or rustic, which are the property of the Church, shall be granted to
someone who desires it, possession shall be given the latter in accordance with
his request; even if the time agreed upon between the parties shall be for the
entire life of the person making it, and the steward shall become a party to
the contract, and shall sign it, along with the person who has made the choice,
and the time for which it is agreed that the usufruct shall be granted shall be
mentioned therein, and it shall clearly be stated that whoever has obtained the
usufruct of the said ecclesiastical land has received it as a favor; and that,
after the time settled and specified has elapsed, the property shall revert to
the ownership enjoyed by the Church; so that the term which had been prescribed
having expired, or the date of the death of the usufructuary having arrived (if
this also should have been agreed upon), he who had acquired the usufruct of
any ecclesiastical property and revenues for the purpose of holding the same
under the said agreement must, none the less, relinquish to the Church what he
had received, including the control of the land itself, and all other immovable
property, tenants, and slaves attached to the same.
Where, however, agreements had not been entered into in the first place under
this condition, We decree that the grant shall not be valid. and that the
ecclesiastical property, not having been legally transferred, shall remain with
the ownership, and can be claimed by the clergy or the stewards.

This right having been conceded to all religious places and all ecclesiastical
congregations established for pious purposes, in order that none of their
property may be encumbered, this rule shall be perpetually observed, even with
reference to such immovable property as has been added by the Imperial House to
the religious places aforesaid. With reference to others, the exception only
applies where the debt is urgent. When, however, the indebtedness cannot be
paid out of the movable property, that which is immovable should be specially
given in pledge, of which the creditor can take for himself the principal and
interest to the amount of four per cent. If the creditor does not consent to
this, then the ecclesiastic having charge of the house shall swear before him
by whom he was ordered, without expense, and with the consent of the majority
of those subject to him, that the debt actually exists, and cannot be paid out
of the movable property. This having been done, notice of the sale of the
Church property shall publicly be given for twenty days, and it shall then be
sold to the person who offers the most; and the price must, by all means, be
employed for the payment of the debt by the purchaser, otherwise, the property
shall not be transferred to him, and in the instrument of sale it must be
inserted that nothing has been done in the matter to the prejudice of the
Divine House.
If, however, a purchaser should not be found, an appraisement shall be made of
the property, and it shall be delivered to the creditor
in payment of the debt, the tenth part of the entire appraisement being added
to the price; this having been done with the consent of the ecclesiastic in
charge, and the majority of those subject to his authority; but property of
inferior value, as compared with the remainder, either with reference to
quality, quantity, or weight, must first be disposed of.
In cases of this kind, the creditor is understood to be one who can prove that
what he lent was destined for the benefit of the Divine House.

Just as the alienation of ecclesiastical property is prohibited, so it is also
prohibited that any barren or onerous property, or such as is encumbered with

This right is granted to others under specified conditions, and certain persons

from whom they received it.

Anyone who has not received the above-mentioned property by a gratuitous title
of alienation, according to law, must restore it, with all its increase during
the intermediate time; and he will be entitled to no action against the sacred
place to which he gave it, but one will lie in his favor against the party who
alienated it. The donee must restore the property unimpaired, with all its
profits and as much more. The creditor, having restored the property pledged to
him, will be entitled to an action only against him who gave it to him in
pledge. The lessee under emphyteusis cannot recover what he gave although the
lease is void, and he must also pay at once what he would have paid every year,
if the contract had been legal; but it is better to hold that all actions
should be refused to anyone making a contract of this kind.1
1 The emphyteusisof the Roman law was a perpetual lease, usually made of public
lands by the government, but not infrequently employed by individuals It
originated during the reign of the Emperor Zeno, and was first adopted for the
purpose of improving lands taken from the enemy, and which were still covered
with forests. It was also employed subsequently to enable the insolvent
patricians of the Eastern Empire to repair their fortunes; as well as to bring
under profit-

If the religious house previously mentioned has buildings which have become
dilapidated and are not worth repairing, they should be leased perpetually by
emphyteusis, and the rent which the lessee should pay for the house which had
fallen into ruin shall be the third part of what would have been collected when
it was still in good condition;, or if he has rebuilt it before paying any of
the rent, he shall give to the religious house half the value of the new
appraisement which has been made; for, in the first instance, the rent under
the emphyteutical lease would have been payable from the beginning.
Extract from Novel 7, Chapter HI; and 120, Chapter VI. Latin Text.
It is also permitted to grant a perpetual emphyteutical lease of property of
this kind, provided the contract is executed in the presence of persons
authorized by law, those who are interested in the
able cultivation conquered provinces which had been depopulated by war. Real
estate of this kind, before its apportionment among the soldiery, who were
generally the tenants of the State, was called ager publicus;when leased to be
cleared, it was known as ager emphyteuticus;if already susceptible of tillage,
it was styled ager vectigalis.The fact that the right derived from an
emphyteutical agreement could be encumbered in many ways, alienated by gift or
purchase, and transferred by the lessee to his heirs, in time caused a doubt to
arise whether the transaction was not in reality a sale rather than a lease. It
was finally decided by imperial authority that it was neither, but sui
generis,a peculiar contract to be interpreted and enforced strictly in
accordance with the terms of its contents. Its permanent character was the
essential and distinguishing feature of emphyteusis.The right could be acquired
by agreement or by will. It differed from dominium,or ownership, in that the
occupant was obliged to pay an annual rent, and take proper care of the land.
It was indispensable that the contract should be reduced to writing, as no
verbal agreement, no matter how solemnly executed, was sufficient to vest an
emphyteutical right. Stringent, and sometimes oppressive provisions might be
inserted therein; for instance, such as rendered the lessee liable for any
damage resulting from unavoidable accident. Even in case of its absolute
sterility, he was not allowed to surrender the property.
If he did not pay the rent for two years when the ownership was vested in the
Church, or in three, when the proprietor was secular, he could be ejected. This
might also be done if he committed waste. The right could not be acquired by
prescription. If the lessee sold it to a third party, the owner could collect a
fine equal to one fiftieth of the purchase money, or of the appraised value of
the property. He was also compelled to transfer to the latter anything which
came into his hands through possession of the land, which could not be classed
as crops, or as directly and legally derived from it.
Emphyteusis bore considerable resemblance to usufruct, but the latter was
considered more advantageous, for the reason that it was more certain, as the
government could, without notice, when the public welfare, which was paramount,
demanded it, dispossess the emphyteuta.In consideration of this privilege,
which might be exercised at any time and subject the tenant to great
inconvenience and loss, the rent was always lower than was the case with
ordinary leaseholds.
Another distinction existed between these two species of contracts, for while
the State, as well as individuals, could lease lands under emphyteusis, this
was not the case with the grant of an usufruct, a proceeding to which the
government never became a party. The emphyteutical right could also be
extinguished by a catastrophe, such as an earthquake or an inundation, which
rendered the land unavailable for the purpose for which it had been rented; by
the death of the lessee without heirs; by the consent of all the parties
interested; and by the expiration
contract making oath that no injury shall be caused to the Divine House. It is
customary for the same rent to be paid which the property ordinarily brought
when it was dedicated to sacred purposes, diminished only by one sixth. If,
however, it should be diminished on account of some misfortune, it should be
leased by emphyteusis for the rent which it yields at the present time. But
where the property is of great value, and still yields little or no return, its
appraisement should be carefully made in order that a just rent for the same
may be established, and only such property should be granted by emphyteusis as
appears to the steward and other ecclesiastics in authority to be suitable for
this purpose.
Extract from Novel 7, Chapter II. Latin Text.
It is even lawful to exchange property with the Emperor for something greater,
better, or of equal value, if the public welfare demands it, and specific
regulations upon this subject exist.
of the term specified in the contract, if the latter had not been executed in
perpetuity.
As possession of the land was granted to the emphyteutafor the purpose of
having it improved, he was at liberty to make such alterations as were adapted
to that end, which the usufructuary, whose occupancy was restricted to mere use
and enjoyment, was not permitted to do. Where the grant was perpetual, the land
was exempt from tax, provided it belonged to the State; this rule, however, was
not applicable to private contracts of this description.
The consideration could neither be increased nor diminished, because it was
considered to constitute a portion of the purchase-money for which the property
was transferred.
This peculiar leasehold has not been generally adopted by European nations. The
rules of the Civil Law on the subject, however, with but trifling
modifications, have been incorporated into the jurisprudence of Italy. The
emphyteutais liable for all taxes and other charges imposed upon the land; he
is entitled not only to the crops, but also to the accessions and the owner's
share of any treasure trove, or minerals; if he should alienate his right, he
will incur no liability for a fine; and he can, at any time, purchase the land
by paying a sum of which the annual rental represents the legal interest.
The lessor may, every twenty-nine years, require the party then in possession
to acknowledge his title as owner, all expenses of which proceeding are to be
paid by the former. (Codice Civile del Regno d'ltalia,Arts. 1556-1565.)
Emphyteutical contracts in perpetuity are declared by the Portuguese Code to
constitute absolute inheritances, and their transmission to be subject to the
rules regulating the descent of estates. (Codigo Civil Portuguêz,Art. 1696.)
Under the laws of Japan, emphyteusis is, to all intents and purposes, an
ordinary leasehold. If the occupant should be forcibly deprived of his income
from the land for five years, he can relinquish his right, otherwise he is
liable for the rent. Its duration may not exceed the term of fifty years, and a
renewal of fifty more is permitted.. Where no term is mentioned, the period is
fixed by law at thirty years, except where some special local custom prevails.
(Civil Code of Japan V, Arts. 270-279.)
In Scotland, the tenure called "feu holding," (nominae feudae firmae), corresponds
almost exactly with the emphyteusis of the Civil Law. It was first established
by statute in 1457, but its origin is of much earlier date. "Feu-holding is
that whereby the vassal is obliged to pay to the superior a yearly rent in
money or grain, and sometimes also in services proper to a farm, as ploughing,
reaping, carriages for the superior's use, etc." (Erskine, Principles of the
Law of Scotland II, IV, 2.)

15. The Same Emperors to Sebastian, Praetorian Prefect.
We decree that whatever has been done which is in any respect contrary to the
ancient and established principles of the orthodox religion shall be absolutely
void; and that whatever relates to the orthodox religion and the faith of the
most holy churches and martyrs, shall be firmly established and restored to the
condition in which it was before the accession of Our Majesty. With reference
to the innovations which took place during the time of the tyranny, not only
against the sacred churches whose supervision belongs to the most blessed and
reverend Bishop Acacius, Patriarch of Our piety, but also against others
situated in different provinces, and their most reverend prelates, whether they
were appointed by virtue of a sacerdotal right or obtained their offices
through the expulsion of other incumbents during those times, or through the
prerogative of the bishop having precedence over others, in or out of the
Councils, or by virtue of the privileges of a metropolitan during the former
evil days, We declare that these wicked orders, pragmatic sanctions, and
impious constitutions, even though they may have been executed with the
ordinary legal formalities, are hereby annulled, and rescinded; and We direct
that such as were granted or established by the Emperors of
Divine Memory who have preceded Our reign, and those which have been afterwards
promulgated by Us with reference to holy churches, martyrs, bishops, clerks, or
monks shall be preserved inviolate.
Moreover, We order and decree that the Holy Church of this most religious
community, the mother of our piety, the source of the orthodox religion of all
Christians, and the most Sacred See of this Imperial Metropolis, shall legally
enjoy all privileges and honors relating to the creation of bishops, in
preference to all others, and that it shall be acknowledged to possess and to
perpetually and firmly hold, by virtue of this Royal City, all other rights
which it possessed before Our reign, or during its existence.

16. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Praetorian Prefect.
The principle set forth in the ancient laws, although obscurely
stated, that donations made for pious purposes were valid, even though
they had not been inserted into written instruments, We plainly and
clearly direct shall stand; just as in other cases, where ancient
rights remain intact if they have reference to gifts of this
description. When, however, anyone makes a donation of property up to
the value of fifty solidi,either to a holy church, to a house for the
entertainment of strangers, an infirmary, an orphan asylum, an
establishment where indigent persons are sheltered, an old men's home,
a foundling hospital to the poor themselves or to some city; such
donations shall be valid, if the necessary legal formalities have been
complied with.  If, however, the donation should be for a larger sum
than that above mentioned (except, of course, where one is made by the
Emperor), it will be void unless it is set forth in a proper
instrument, for no one shall have the right for any reason, and under
the pretext of piety, to change the rules established by the ancients
concerning such donations, with the exception of those which We have
expressly mentioned.  Given 528.

17. The Same to Demosthenes, Praetorian Prefect.
We order that no one shall be permitted to sell, hypothecate, or pledge any of
the most sacred and mysterious vessels, clothing, and other articles which have
been donated, and are necessary for the services of the Divine Religion; as
even the ancient laws did not sanction that things employed in the celebration
of Divine rites should be affected by human liens.
We also order that such property can, under all circumstances, be recovered
from those who have been so bold as to take it, not only by the most reverend
bishops, but also by the ecclesiastical stewards, as well as by the custodians
of the sacred vessels; nor shall any actions be granted to the parties in
possession of the same, for the recovery of the price received for the said
property, or for the collection of interest where it has been pledged, but they
shall be refused every
action of this kind, and shall, by all means, be required to make restitution.
Where, however, the vessels have been melted, or changed in any way, or
disposed of, still an action either in rem, in conditionem,or in factumwill lie
for their recovery, or for their value; a fact which is repeatedly stated in
many different sections of the law.
An exception, however, is made in instances where any of these events has
occurred on account of captivity (which we detest); for if it was necessary for
a sale, an hypothecation, or a pledge of the aforesaid sacred property to be
made for the purpose of redeeming captives, We permit this to be done; as it is
praiseworthy for the souls of men to be preferred to any vessels or vestments
whatsoever. We direct that this rule shall apply not only to cases which may
occur hereafter, but also to those that are now pending.
Extract from Novel 120, Chapter X. Latin Text.
Moreover, if a church is in debt, and has vessels for which it has no use, and
cannot otherwise pay its indebtedness without the alienation or sale of its
immovable property, the said vessels may be offered intact to some other
religious house, after the transaction has been authorized by the ecclesiastic
in charge, or, after the vessels have been melted, they may be sold to anyone
else to provide for the payment of the debt.
He, however, who receives property in violation of this law, shall suffer the
same penalty prescribed for those who acquire lands belonging to the church.
18. The Same, to Demosthenes, Praetorian Prefect.
We order that property that comes into the hands of churches, hospitals,
monasteries, orphan asylums, old men's homes, foundling hospitals, insane
asylums, or any other establishments of this kind, whether it is derived from
the liberality of the people, or from donations inter vivosor mortis causa,or
from a last will, or has been acquired by any other lucrative title, shall be
free and immune from interference; for although the law enacted on this subject
exerts all its force with reference to other persons, still, in consideration
of piety, its vigor should be relaxed so far as the Church or any other
institutions which have been set apart for pious uses are concerned. For why
should we not make a distinction between Divine and human things? And why
should not the privileges to which it is entitled be reserved in favor of
Heaven?
(1) This law shall not only be observed in cases which may arise hereafter, but
also in those which are at present pending, and which have not yet been
determined, either by a judicial decision or by amicable compromise.
Published at the seventh military of this renowned City, in the new Consistory
of the Palace of Justinian.
19. The Same to Julian, Praetorian Prefect.
Although a proper distinction exists between Divine and public law and private
convenience, We decree that where anyone leaves
an estate, a legacy, a trust, or anything under the title of a donation, or
sells anything, either to the Holy Church, or to houses of charity, hospitals,
monasteries of men and women, orphan asylums, insane asylums, old men's homes
or cities, a long time shall be granted them to recover what has been donated,
sold, or bequeathed, and they shall not be barred by ordinary prescription. But
where any money or property is bequeathed for the redemption of captives, or
for any other lawful object, We decree that a very long time shall be granted
for its recovery. And, indeed, according to the dictates of Our heart, actions
of this kind should not be barred by the lapse of any length of time; but, in
order that it may not be prolonged indefinitely, We have chosen to limit it to
the longest period to which the life of man may extend, and have consented that
the right to bring this action shall not be barred until after the term of a
hundred years shall have elapsed, for only then do We permit the right of
recovery of this kind to be extinguished.
Therefore, whether an estate, a legacy, or a trust has been left to the above-
mentioned most sacred places, or to cities, or whether a donation or a sale of
any property movable, immovable, or which can move itself has been negotiated;
or whether a bequest has been made for the redemption of captives, or funds
donated for that purpose; there shall be an almost perpetual right to recover
them, and that right shall be extended for the term of a hundred years (as has
already been stated), without any other prescription being allowed, either
against the original parties themselves, or their heirs or successors. (1) In
all these cases, We not only grant personal actions but also real and
hypothecary ones, in accordance with the terms of Our Constitution which
concedes the hypothecary action to legatees and the beneficiaries of trusts;
and with reference to all the matters above mentioned We only impose the term
of human life, that is to say a hundred years. Again, We order all these things
to be observed not only in such cases as may hereafter arise, but also in those
which are now pending in court.
Given under the Consulate of Our Lord Justinian, 528.
Extract from Novel 131, Chapter VI. Latin Text.
.Prescription prevents some actions from being brought after ten years; others
after twenty years; and others still after thirty years; but if these lie in
favor of some religious house, they will only be barred after forty years.
Usucaption for three years, or prescription after four, remaining in all their
force, the Roman Church alone enjoys the term or privilege of a hundred years.

1. The Emperor Constantine to the Clergy, Greeting:
In accordance with the law enacted some time since for your benefit, on account
of your deserts, by the terms of which law no one can compel you or your slaves
to pay any new taxes, you will enjoy the privilege of exemption from them; and,
moreover, you shall not be required to entertain guests.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of Placidus
and Romulus, 343.
2. The Emperor Constantine and Julian-Caesar to Felix, Bishop.
Let all ecclesiastics be free from the imposition of taxes which are not due,
and from the wickedness of unjust exactions; for no agreement having reference
to base employments shall be required of them; and while traders are liable to
certain contributions, all ecclesiastics shall be exempt from the noise and
bustle incident to transactions of this kind. For when they have accumulated
anything, either through economy, foresight, or trade (if they know their
conduct to have been honorable), they are obliged to devote it to the relief of
the poor and needy. Anything which can be acquired or accumulated by the said
ecclesiastics in factories or shops, they must consider to have been obtained
for the benefit of religion.
(1) The laws of the Divine Emperor, My Father, provide that their employees who
are engaged with them in the same occupation, shall also enjoy the same
privileges as the clergy themselves.
(2) Hence the aforesaid persons shall be exempt from the necessity and the
annoyance of extraordinary burdens.
(3) Nor shall they, or their property, be liable to contribution for travelling
expenses.
(4) This privilege is granted to all ecclesiastics, so that their wives,
children, and servants, both male and female, and their sons and daughters,
shall always remain exempt from impositions of this kind.

Moreover, no community or public or private person shall presume to impose upon
any church or other sacred place, or ecclesiastic,
any collections, exactions, expenses for couriers, or travelling expenses; or
seize property belonging to the Church. If they should do so, and refuse to
make amends after having been notified by the Church or the Emperor, they shall
be liable to triple damages, and their property shall be confiscated by the
government, and shall not be returned until the satisfaction due has been
rendered.
3. The Same Emperor and Caesar to Taunts, Praetorian Prefect.
In order that your authority may not permit such of the clergy as have lands
not only to be released from other liabilities, but also that they may be
required to pay the taxes to the Treasury on the lands which are possessed by
them, We order that all ecclesiastics possessed of real estate in the provinces
shall pay the claims due to the Treasury, otherwise it shall be transferred.
Given on the day before the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of
Constantius, Consul for the tenth time, and Julian-Caesar, Consul for the third

4. The Same to Taurus, Praetorian Prefect.
Where officials, charged with the collection of the public funds, have not
rendered an account of their last or preceding administration, or have
appropriated money belonging to the Treasury, and aspire the honors of the
Church, they shall be reduced to their previous condition. If, however, after
their accounts have been rendered and proper investigation has been made, they
are found not to be liable for anything (if their demand has been made with
sincerity), this favor shall be granted them with the consent of their
superiors, and they need not apprehend the loss of their possessions. But where
they have attempted to become members of the clergy by the practice of
clandestine arts, two-thirds of their estates shall be granted to their
children, or if they have no offspring, to their next of kin, and they can
retain the third part of their own property for themselves. But if they have no
near relatives, two-thirds of it shall go to those officials with whom they
have served, and only the remaining third shall be reserved for themselves.
Given on the fourth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of Taurus
and Florentius, 361.
Extract from Novel 123, Chapter XV. Latin Text.
We do not permit a member of the curia,or any other official, to become an
ecclesiastic, lest injury be done to the sacred body of the clergy; for if
persons of this kind are admitted to the clerical order they shall be
considered as never having received ordination, and shall be restored to their
former condition, unless some of them should happen to have lived a monastic
life for not less than fifteen years; as We order that such persons shall be
ordained, and that they shall retain for themselves the fourth part of their
own property, and that the remaining three-fourths shall belong to the curiaand
the Treasury; and this shall be done where the person who aspires to become a
member of the clergy has led a respectable and monastic life.
(1) If, however, anyone should have obtained the honor of admission to the
clergy and afterwards marries, or takes a concubine, he shall be restored to
his original condition, even though he held a position in a branch of the
ecclesiastical order whose members are not forbidden to marry.
The same rule applies to all other monks, even though they may not previously
have been members of a curia.And, generally speaking, anyone who is admitted to
any rank in the clergy, and returns to a secular life, shall be deprived of his
honors and restored to his former status as a citizen.
5. The Emperor Jovinian to Secundus, Praetorian Prefect.
If anyone should merely attempt to, I do not say ravish, but marry a
consecrated virgin, he shall suffer the penalty of death.
Given on the eleventh of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Gratian,
Consul for the third time, and Merobaudus.
6. The Emperors Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian to Cataphronius.
We order that priests, deacons, sub-deacons, exorcists, altar attendants, and
acolytes shall be exempt from personal employments.
Given the third of the Nonesof March, during the Consulate of Gratian, Consul
for the third time, and Merobaudus, 377.
7. The Emperor Theodosius said:
"No bishop shall be compelled to give testimony either under the praetorian or
the civil law." He also said that it is not fitting for a bishop to be
permitted to testify, for this would be a personal hardship for him, and would
compromise his sacerdotal dignity, which is exempt from such obligations.

But let the judge send some of his officials to them, in order that they may
tell what they know on the Holy Scriptures, as is proper for priests to do, but
they shall not be sworn.
8. The Same, to Paulinus, Augustal Praetorian Prefect.
Priests can give their testimony without subjecting them to the injury of
torture, but in such a way that they may not testify falsely. Where other
members of the clergy who belong to lower degrees or orders are called to give
their evidence, they shall be heard in accordance with what the laws direct; so
that litigants may be entitled to the action for deceit against priests who, on
account of their superior rank, cannot by the infliction of any corporeal
penalty, be compelled to testify, and who, for the reason that they fear
nothing, have suppressed the truth. For those are much more worthy of
punishment upon whom higher honors have been bestowed by Our command, when they
are found guilty of the crime of concealing the facts.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Arcadius
and Bauto, 385.
Extracts from Novel 123, Chapter XX. Latin Text.
When either priests or deacons have been convicted of giving false testimony,
and the case is one in which the payment of money is involved, they shall be
excluded from their Divine Ministry for the term of three years, and shall be
confined in a monastery by way of punishment. In criminal cases, however, they
shall be deprived of their clerical honors, and punished with the penalties
prescribed by law.
Other members of the clergy shall, under similar circumstances, be expelled
from their ecclesiastical offices without distinction of cases, and be punished
with blows.
9. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Tatian, Praetorian
Prefect.
Let no woman, unless she has reached the age of fifty years, in accordance with
the precept of the apostle, be admitted to the association of the order of
deaconesses.
Given at Milan on the eleventh of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of
Valentinian, Consul for the fourth time, and Neotherius, 390.
Extract from Novel 13, Chapter 123. Latin Text.
We do not permit anyone to become a priest under the age of thirty-five years,
nor to become a deacon or subdeacon under twenty-five years, nor a reader under
eighteen years. We also forbid anyone to be ordained a bishop under the age of
thirty-five years.
Extract from Novel 13, Chapter 123. Latin Text.
We direct that no woman who is under forty years of age, or who has been
married twice, shall be ordained a deaconess in the Holy Church.
10. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Theodore, Praetorian Prefect.
If anyone should be guilty of the sacrilege of forcing his way into a Catholic
Church, or doing any injury to the priests and ministers, to the service, or to
the place itself, he shall be punished by the provincial authorities, so that
the head of the priests of the province and of the ministers of the Catholic
Church may know that the culprit has received a capital sentence, whether he
has been convicted, or confessed that he was guilty of committing an offence
against the place itself, or the worship of God, without waiting for the bishop
to demand punishment for the injury inflicted upon him, as his sanctity does
not allow him to take notice of it; and it shall be praiseworthy for all
persons to prosecute any atrocious injuries committed against priests or
ministers of religion as public crimes, and their perpetrators as deserving of
punishment. If the number of those guilty of violence is so great that they
cannot be arrested by the civil authorities, with the assistance of the people,
for the reason that they defend
themselves by arms, or are protected by the difficulty of access to the place,
the Governors of the provinces shall not hesitate to call for military
assistance by public proclamation, and inflict suitable punishment for an
offence of this description.
Given at Milan, on the seventh of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of
Honorius, Consul for the third time, and Eutychianus, 398.
Extract from Novel 123, Chapter XXXI. Latin Text.
According to the new law, a crime of this kind is punished with scourging or
exile, but if the culprit interferes with the sacred rites, or prevents them
from being celebrated, he shall be put to death.
The same rule applies to the litanies, for the offender is scourged and sent
into exile for an ordinary offence, but if he interferes with them, he is
punished with death. We forbid members of the laity from conducting the service
of litanies without ecclesiastics, because this should not be done without
prayers and the presence of the cross.
11. The Same to Eutychianus, Praetorian Prefect.
In churches which are in the possession of different persons (as is customary),
or which have been established in villages or any other places whatsoever,
members of the clergy are not ordained who belong to any other parish or
village than that where the church is situated, so that they may assume the
burden and responsibility of their own establishment; and only a certain number
of the clergy can be ordained by the bishop, according to the size and means of
each parish.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Honorius,
Consul for the fourth time, and Eutychianus, 398.
12. The Same to Eutychianus, Praetorian Prefect.
When any member of a curiareceives holy orders, and, after having been warned,
is not returned to his former condition, he can immediately be reduced to it by
the power and authority of the judges, through the employment of force; for we
do not permit the clergy to profit by the former law which did not forbid
decurions to become ecclesiastics, provided they had given up their property.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Honorius,
Consul for the fourth time, and Eutychianus, 398.
13. The Same to Fidianus, Vicegerent.
If the privileges of a holy church have been violated by the rashness of
simulated ignorance of anyone, he shall be punished with a fine of five pounds
of gold.
New Constitution of the Emperor Frederick, Concerning the Laws and Customs
providing against the Infringement of the Liberties of the Church. Coll. 10.
Moreover, let any community or person that has been excommunicated, and has
persevered for more than a year in the offence of
having infringed or violated the liberties of the Church, be placed under the
ban of the empire; from which he or it shall by no means be relieved, without
having previously obtained from the Church the benefit of absolution.
14. The Same to Adrian, Praetorian Prefect.
If anyone who has been removed from the office, and deprived of the title of
bishop by a convocation of ecclesiastics, should be convicted of having plotted
against the public order and tranquillity, and again seek the sacerdotal
position from which he was deposed, he shall be compelled to pass the remainder
of his life a hundred miles from the city whose peace he disturbed; shall not
have access to Us, nor hope to obtain a rescript for his benefit; but he shall
be deprived of even such as he may have obtained, and those who defend him
shall be the objects of Our indignation.
Given at Ravenna, on the day before the Nonesof February, during the Consulate
of Stilicho and Aurelian, 400.
Extract from Novel 123, Chapter XL Latin Text.
If a bishop, who has been deposed from the priesthood, having left the place in
which he was ordered to remain, should presume to enter the city from which he
was expelled, We command that he shall be confined in a monastery situated in
some other country, so that, while there, he may expiate the offences which he
committed while a member of the clergy.
15. The Same to Studius, Urban Prefect.
We forbid persons to hold religious assemblies in private houses, even outside
the Church, under the penalty of confiscation of the house, if the owner of the
same permitted ecclesiastics to hold new and tumultuous meetings therein
outside the church.
Given at Constantinople, on the fourth of the Kalendsof September, during the
Consulate of Honorius, Consul for the seventh time, and Aristenetus, 404.
16. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Anthenius, Praetorian Prefect.
Let any serf attached to the glebe abstain from every ecclesiastical office, if
the owner of the land does not give his consent; so that if he has been
ordained in the place where he was born, he can assume the duties of the
priesthood under the condition that his master will agree to pay the taxes to
which he is liable, and is willing for someone to be appointed in his stead to
perform his duties; with the understanding that immunity shall be granted from
any taxes from which churches are exempt. No rescript promulgated against this
law shall be valid.
Given during the Consulate of Honorius, Consul for the eighth time, and
Theodosius, Consul for the third time, 409.
17. The Same to Maximus, Praetorian Prefect.
It pleases Our Majesty that members of the ecclesiastical order shall not
interfere in any way with public acts or political affairs with which their
profession has no concern.
(1) Moreover, We do not give permission to those who are called parabolanito be
present at any public exhibition, or at assemblies of the people, or in court,
unless they do so in cases of their own when they are required to appear,
either for the purpose of bringing an action against someone, or where they
themselves are sued, or where one has been appointed as the representative of
their entire body. If anyone violates this regulation, he shall be expelled
from the parabolani,be subjected to suitable punishment, and never be restored
to his former position.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Kalendsof October, during the
Consulate of Theodosius, Consul for the seventh time, and Palladius, 416.
Extract from Novel 123, Chapter X. Latin Text.
We forbid the reverend bishops, priests, deacons, sub-deacons, readers, and all
other members of any religious organization, who have been regularly appointed,
to play backgammon, or to participate in, or be present at any other games, or
at any exhibition merely for the pleasure of witnessing it.
(1) Moreover, We order that anyone who violates this law shall be suspended
from his sacred functions for the term of three years, and be confined in a
monastery. If, however, in the meantime, he should show that he is penitent,
the bishop to whose authority he is subject can shorten the time, and reinstate
him in his former office.
18. The Same to Monaxius, Praetorian Prefect.
We order that the parabolani,who are appointed to take charge of the sick,
shall be limited to six hundred in number, and that the said six hundred
parabolaniselected for duties of this kind shall be appointed by the most
reverend Bishop of Alexandria from among those who formerly acted as such, and
who, in consequence, are experienced in the care of persons who are ill; those,
of course, being excepted who have been invested with office, and are members
of the curiae.If, however, any of these should die, another shall be appointed
in his place by the above-mentioned bishop, with the exception of those
who have held office and belong to the curiae;so that the said six hundred shall
be subject to the orders and at the disposal of the Most Reverend Bishop, and
shall act under his supervision. All other provisions which have formerly been
established under the law previously enacted with reference to
parabolani,whether they relate to exhibitions or proceedings in court, shall be
observed (as has already
been established).
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Nonesof February, during the
Consulate of Honorius, Consul for the twelfth time, and

19. The Same to Palladius, Urban Prefect.
He who pursues a proper course of conduct in the world should not have his
reputation tarnished by intimacy with a woman whom he calls his sister.
Therefore everyone, no matter what rank in the priesthood he may hold, or what
ecclesiastical distinction may have been conferred upon him, must take notice
that association with strange women is forbidden him, and that permission is
only granted to have his mother, his daughter, or his sister occupy his house
with him; for natural relationship prevents anything criminal from being
suspected in cases of this kind. The love of chastity induces Us not to exclude
any who, before the ordination of their husbands, were worthy of lawful
marriage, for those may not improperly be permitted to associate with members
of the clergy, who, by their companionship, have rendered their husbands worthy
of the priesthood.
Given at Ravenna, on the eighth of the Idesof May, during the Consulate of
Theodosius, Consul for the ninth time, and Constantius, Consul for the fifth

Much more reason exists why they should not retain their wives, as only
choristers and readers are allowed to marry, for We absolutely forbid all
others to do so, and if either of the latter marry a second time, they shall
not be eligible to the high office of the priesthood.
Extract from Novel 6, Chapter V. Latin Text.
A bishop is not permitted to have a wife, and if he is proved to have one, he
shall be degraded from the rank of which he has rendered himself unworthy.
20. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Taurus, Praetorian Prefect.
Whenever a priest, deacon, deaconess, sub-deacon, or member of any other
ecclesiastical order, monk, or woman consecrated to a solitary life, dies
intestate without leaving any relatives of either sex, children, or connections
by affinity or cognation, or a wife; any property that the said ecclesiastic,
or conobite of either sex left, and which would have belonged to him or her,
shall pass to the church or monastery to which they were appointed; with the
exception of anything that may be due as taxes, or liable under the right of
patronage, or for which the said persons were responsible on account of his
membership in a curia.For it is not just that property forming part of a
peculiumand to which a patron has a legal right, or the owner to whom the
person in question was subjected is entitled to possession of; or which is
known to belong to the curiaunder certain conditions, in accordance with the
tenor of the constitution formerly promulgated, should be retained by churches
or monasteries; still, the churches or monasteries retain the rights of action
vested in them, where anyone is liable under the aforesaid conditions, or dies
bound on account of any transaction, or any ecclesiastical matter whatsoever.
Given on the eighteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Ariovindus and Asper, 434.
Extract from Novel 5, Chapter V. Latin Text.
Now, however, when a man becomes a monk, by this very act he is understood to
have offered all his property to the monastery, if he has not previously made a
will; and hence, as he cannot dispose of it himself, the law disposes of it for
him; so that if he leaves children to whom he gave nothing, or a smaller
portion than that to which they were entitled, a sufficient sum should be
deducted from the property intended for the monastery to prevent injustice from
being done to them. The rights of the wife and other creditors should also be
protected.
21. The Same Emperors to Thomas, Praetorian Prefect.
As in the case of bishops of the orthodox faith, so in that of priests and
deacons, those who have obtained illustrious rank by means of an honorable
title are not forbidden to discharge, by means of substitutes and at their own
risk, the official duties imposed upon them by curiae.
Given at Constantinople, on the fourth of the Nonesof April, during the
Consulate of Isidor and Senator, 436.
22. The Same Emperors to Florentinus, Praetorian Prefect.
If any malicious accusation of a criminal offence should be brought before a
competent judge against a bishop of the Holy Religion, and the case should be
dismissed, We order that the accuser shall be condemned to pay a fine of thirty
pounds of gold to the Treasury.
(1) Moreover, We order that all privileges which have been granted by the laws
to the holy churches for the benefit of refugees, clerks, deans, or any other
ecclesiastics, shall remain intact and unimpaired.
(2) We also order that all members of the clergy and monks who, for the purpose
of transacting ecclesiastical business, or on account of religion, have
travelled from their own country to this Fair City, shall be furnished with
letters of the bishop to whom each of them who makes the journey owes
obedience; and they are hereby notified that if they do not comply with this
rule, they alone will be to blame if they are not considered clerks or monks.
Given under the Consulate of Theodosius, Consul for the seventeenth time, and
Festus, 439.
Extracts from Novel 123, Chapter VIII. Latin Text.
No bishop shall be produced or compelled to appear in court before a civil or
military judge in any case whatsoever against his consent, unless the Emperor
orders him to do so. Any judge who commands him to be produced or appear shall,
after having been deprived of his office, pay twenty pounds of gold to the
church to which the bishop belongs; and the bailiff, after having been deprived
of his office, shall be scourged and sentenced to deportation.
23. The Emperors Valentinian and Martian to Palladius, Praetorian Prefect.
As Fabianus, of venerable memory, Bishop of this Fair City, was held in such
high esteem by the almost innumerable ecclesiastics assembled at Chalcedon,
that Eutyches, who held contrary religious opinions, was, with all his wicked
doctrines, unanimously condemned, let the impious memory of Eutyches be
consigned to oblivion, and the praiseworthy memory of Fabianus be exalted.
Given at Constantinople, the day before the Nonesof July, during the Consulate
of Asporatius.
24. The Same to Palladius, Praetorian Prefect.
Abequest left by a will or a codicil to the poor, shall not be considered void,
as having been bequeathed to uncertain persons; but in every respect shall
stand as valid and unimpaired.
25. The Emperor Martian to Constantine, Praetorian Prefect.
When members of the clergy are summoned to court, they have a right to take
their cases before the tribunals of the bishop, provided the plaintiff
consents. If, however, he should be unwilling to submit the matter to the
decision of the Most Reverend Archbishop, or to bring it before your most
eminent tribunal, the investigation against the Catholic clerks appointed by
the Most Reverend Archbishop of this City, or against the Most Reverend
Steward, not only with reference to their own private affairs, but also those
in which the Church is concerned, he must not attempt, either in a civil or a
criminal proceeding, to cite the said clerk into any other court, or before any
other judge.
(1) Moreover, when the most reverend clergy of the orthodox churches previously
mentioned  which churches are under the jurisdiction of the Most Religious
Archbishop of this Illustrious City  appear before the tribunal, either in
person or by attorneys appointed by themselves, they shall be punished by your
authority; and they must present to the bailiffs, by whom they have been
summoned, the steward or defender of the Most Holy Church of this City, who
shall become liable for them as surety, to the amount of fifty pounds of gold.
The Most Reverend Steward of the Church of this Fair City, when summoned to
court, shall not provide a surety for himself, inasmuch as he is expected to
appear as surety for other members of the clergy; but reliance should be placed
upon his good faith. Where, however, several of the clergy are involved in
litigation (with the exception of the Most Reverend Steward) and the amount in
dispute appears to exceed that which We have mentioned, each clerk who is
summoned shall furnish the bailiff with a bond for the amount in excess; but no
oath shall be required, for the reason that clerks are, in compliance with the
ecclesiastical regulations and canons established in ancient times by the most
blessed bishops, forbidden to be sworn.
(2) We, however, have decided that the Most Reverend Steward, or the other
members of the clergy who are subject to the jurisdiction of the Most Blessed
Bishop of this Most Splendid City, relying upon the authority of your decision,
shall only pay two solidito the bailiffs for their citation, and for the
appointment of an attorney, if they desire to try the case by his agency. We
order that whatever is usually done in other cases with reference to the
various attendants of your eminent tribunal shall be observed in those of the
aforesaid members of the clergy; and that the costs and expenses of the suit
paid by members of the clergy shall be smaller in amount, and imposed with
greater indulgence than those to which others are subjected.
Given on the eighth of April, during the Consulate of Vararius and John, 456.
Extract from Novel 123, Chapter XXVIII. Latin Text.
At present, however, no person who holds an ecclesiastical office is permitted
to pay any more than four siliquaein a criminal case, or one involving a sum of
money, whether the party be a deaconess, a monk, a hermit, or a nun; unless
when he or she is summoned by order of the Emperor to other provinces, and in
this instance, a bailiff cannot collect more than one solidus.
Abishop should not pay anything under the name of a contribution, in matters in
which his church is involved; as actions which are brought against churches are
either directed against the stewards thereof, or persons who are appointed for
that purpose.
Anyone who violates this law, shall pay double the amount which he collected,
and be degraded, if he is a soldier; or expelled from the body of the clergy,
if he is a member of it.
Extracts from Novel 112, Chapter II. Latin Text.
Generally speaking, however, the judge provides that a party who has been
summoned shall not be compelled to appear, or pay the ordinary contribution,
unless the plaintiff (whether he himself conducts his case or employs an
attorney), has signed the complaint with his own hand, or by that of a notary;
and, after having filed the papers, provides a solvent surety who will remain
until the case has been decided, which security shall be at the risk of him to
whom it is given; and if he should be convicted of having unjustly brought the
action, he must pay the defendant, to indemnify him for his costs and expenses,
the tenth part of the amount claimed in the petition.
If, however, he is unable to furnish a surety, he must give security by his
oath with reference to the matters above mentioned, and must state, with his
hands upon the Holy Gospels, that he cannot give a surety; and if he does not
do so, the judge shall be liable to lose his office, and to pay a fine of ten
pounds of gold. The property of the bailiff shall be confiscated, and he shall
be condemned to exile, unless these formalities have been dispensd with by the
consent of both parties.
26. The Emperor Leo to Julian, Praetorian Prefect.
We decree that, hereafter, no monk, nor anyone else, no matter what his station
or rank, shall unlawfully attempt to carry the Holy Cross, or the relics of the
martyrs into any public house or place of any description, which has been set
apart for the pleasure of the people; or shall venture to take possession of
any building which has been erected for public purposes, or popular amusement.
For, as religious houses are not lacking, after the episcopal authorities have
been consulted, as is necessary, the relics of the holy martyrs can be placed
therein, not by the arbitrary action of anyone, but by the authority of the
Most Reverend Bishops. Hence Our laws, public discipline, and the reputation of
the monks themselves, demand the exercise of patience and moderation, and each
monk, as well as every member of other orders, should zealously attempt always
to practice these virtues.
27. The Same to Eutychius, Praetorian Prefect.
Anyone who, after having been discharged from the army, or having completed his
term of office, has been released from the public duties to which he was liable
by his condition, by custom, or by law, associates with members of the clergy,
and prefers and desires to be included among the ministers of the true orthodox
faith, cannot be restored to his former status, by the severe terms of any
decision; nor shall he be removed with evil intent from the temples of God to
which he has consecrated himself, but he shall remain secure and quiet in those
most blessed employments to which, with the best resolutions, he has devoted
himself for the purpose of obtaining rest during his remaining years, after the
weariness of a long, laborious life. If, however, any actions should with
lawful intention be brought against himself or his property, he must answer as
required by law; with the exception of members of the first company of the
triarii,whom the provisions of the most Sacred Constitutions have declared
shall always be subjected to the precepts of your authority, as well as to the
requirements of the public welfare.
28. The Emperors Leo and Anthenius to Nicostratus, Praetorian Prefect.
We decree that no one, whether he has been appointed an heir by will or
obtained succession ab intestato,or is the beneficiary of a trust, or a
legatee, shall be permitted, with malicious intent, to infringe or violate the
dispositions of a pious testator by alleging that a legacy or a trust is
uncertain, when a bequest has been left for the redemption of captives; but We
command that the money shall, by all means, be collected and employed for the
benevolent purpose designated by the will of the testator.
(1) If, indeed, a testator should indicate the person by whom he desires the
redemption of the captives to be accomplished, he who was especially appointed
for that purpose shall have the right to collect the legacy or the money left
in trust, and carry out the wishes of the
testator, in accordance with the dictates of his conscience. But when no person
has been designated with this end in view, and the testator has merely fixed
the amount of the legacy or the trust, which is to be used as above mentioned,
the Most Reverend Bishop of this City, where the testator was born, shall have
the power to collect the money which was left, and shall, without any delay (as
is proper), carry out the pious intentions of the deceased.
(2) Moreover, as soon as the Most Reverend Bishop shall have obtained the money
left for this benevolent purpose, after having complied with the proper
formalities, he must immediately inform the Governor of the province of the
amount, and of the date when he received it. We order that, after the
expiration of a year, he shall render an account of the number of captives
ransomed, as well as of the sums paid out for this purpose, so that the pious
wishes of deceased persons may, in every respect be complied with; but the Most
Sacred Bishops must perform the acts above mentioned gratuitously, and without
any expense, in order that the money left with a charitable object may not be
wasted in litigation.
(3) Where the testator who left a legacy or a trust of this kind, without
designating anyone to have charge of it, belongs to a barbarous nation, and any
doubt arises with reference to his country, the Most Reverend Bishop of the
town in which the said testator died, shall have the right to demand the
legacy, or the trust, and shall carry out the intentions of the deceased in
every respect.
(4) When a testator dies in a village or in the country, the Most Reyerend
Bishop having jurisdiction over the said village or district shall be entitled
to claim the bequest.
(5) And, in order that the pious intentions of the deceased may not be
circumvented by malicious cunning or fraud, We permit all persons who know that
any property was left by the testator for this purpose to notify the
illustrious Governor of the province, or the bishop of the city. Nor shall they
have any reason to fear that the name of informer will be applied to them, as
not only their fidelity and industry but also their piety is worthy of praise
and honor, as they have brought truth and valuable information to the ears of
public officials.
Extract of Novel 131, Chapter XI. Latin Text.
Even if a testator or a donor may have forbidden the bishop to have any share
in the execution of his bequest, he, nevertheless, can do so; and the same rule
applies to a steward.
(1) When, however, those who are ordered to act, neglect to carry out the
wishes of the deceased, after having been notified once or twice by the bishop,
or the steward through public officials, they shall forfeit any benefits to
which they are entitled under the will, and the bishop shall have the right to
claim them, and to distribute anything else which should be distributed, and if
he does not do so, he should be held accountable.
29. The Same to Armasius, Praetorian Prefect.
Where anyone, by the grace of God, is raised to the dignity of bishop, either
in this Imperial City, or in any other of the provinces of the Empire scattered
over the entire world, this should be done with the purest human intentions,
with a consciousness of merit in the choice, and with sincere approval of all.
No one shall purchase any office in the priesthood by the use of money, for
each one must be estimated according to his deserts, and it is not sufficient
to calculate how much he can pay; for, indeed, what place will be secure, and
what excuse will be valid, if the holy temples of God are obtained by the use
of money? What protection can we provide for integrity, or what defence for the
Faith, if the thirst for gold creeps into our sacred places? And, finally, what
precaution or security will avail, if the holiness which should be
incorruptible is corrupted? Let the profane ardor of avarice cease to threaten
our altars, and let this disgraceful crime be banished from our holy
sanctuaries.
Therefore, in our times, chaste and humble bishops are selected, so that,
wherever they may go, they will purify everything with the morality of their
own lives. An archbishop is ordained not with money but with prayers, and he
should also be so destitute of ambition as to be compelled to take the office
tendered him, and, having been re.quested, he should decline, and having been
invited, he should flee; so that necessity alone may be an excuse for
acceptance. For surely he is unworthy of the priesthood unless he is ordained
against his consent; since, if anyone should be convicted of having obtained
this Holy and Venerated Archipiscopal See by the employment of money, or of
having ordained another, or chosen him for some valuable consideration, he
ought to be punished just as a person who has committed high treason, and be
degraded from his rank in the priesthood. We decree that he shall not only be
ineligible to this honor hereafter, but be condemned to perpetual infamy, so
that the same penalty may be inflicted upon those who are defiled by the same
crime.1
Given at Constantinople on the eighth of the Idesof March, during the Consulate
of Martian and Zeno.
1 The Canon Law treats simony at great length, and in minute detail; which
indicates the general prevalence of the practice, and the futility of the
enactments designed to prevent it. A corrupt presentation was absolutely void;
if he who offered the bribe was a monk or a layman, he was denounced as a
heretic and anathematized; and the prelate or priest who accepted it was
degraded from office.

30. The Same to Dioscorus, Praetorian Prefect.
We order that the superintendents of orphan asylums in this Renowned City
(where no provision of the law prevents), who are, as it were, the guardians of
wards and the curators of minors, shall have the right to act as plaintiffs or
defendants, without being compelled to furnish security with reference to
persons and their business (if they have any), both in and out of court, as
necessity may require, just as guardians and curators do; so that the property
of the persons aforesaid may be transferred to them by those having charge of
the same, in the presence of public officials, that is to say, notaries; or an
inventory shall be made in this Renowned City, before the master of the census;
or in the provinces, before the Governor, or the defender of the district, and
if they ascertain that any of said property should be sold, for instance, to
pay interest or for some other urgent reason, they shall be permitted to make a
contract to alienate the same, after an appraisement has been made; and the
price of the said property obtained from this source shall be placed in the
hands of the same persons.
It is proper for superintendents of orphan asylums to discharge their
benevolent and religious duty for the time, without being obliged to render
accounts as guardians or curators; for it is hard, and even unjust that those
who, through fear of God, have supported minors without parents or property,
and have exerted themselves to rear them with parental affection, should be
annoyed by the cunning machinations of others (if this should take place).
31. The Same to Eutropius, Praetorian Prefect.

Simony, although regarded with abhorrence, and the offender classed as a thief
("Latro est qui aurum ex religione sectatur"),was not a criminal offence at
Common Law. The Stat. 31 Eliz. provided that members of the clergy who were
guilty of it should forfeit a year's profit of the benefit or living, and be
forever incapacitated from holding a'sacerdotal office.
"Simony is odious in the eye of the Common Law."
"The Common Law would have the patron so far from simony, as it denied him to
recover damages, in a quare impedit,or assise of darrein presentment,before the
statute of W. 2 cap. 5."

the presentee, &c., is sworn to commit no simony." (Coke, Institutes III,

in civil cases through the rulings or citations of superior or inferior
magistrates; nor shall be forced to leave any province, district, or region, in
which they live; and none of them shall be ordered, through unfortunate
necessity, to abandon the churches or monasteries, in which they reside through
devotion to religion; but they shall appear before the ordinary judges, that is
to say, the Governors of the provinces, in which they reside, where they may
perform their duties to their churches, and defend all actions brought against
them; so that, during the hours and time when men devoted to a religious life
ought to be free from the turbulent proceedings of the courts, or when the
malicious intent of their adversaries leaves them at rest, betaking themselves
to their monasteries and sacred churches, by their self-reliance and the
employment of their earnest prayers they may, the more readily, perform the
services of the sacred altars where they have their domiciles.
(1) If anyone for some reason should wish to institute legal proceedings in
this Royal City against a bishop, a priest, or other ecclesiastic attached to
the Holy Churches, or against any monks, no matter in what provinces they may
be found; he shall not be permitted to summon them before any other tribunal
than yours, where the honor due to Your Blessedness must be paid by them, and a
proper number of advocates shall be furnished them for their defence.
(2) Moreover, when the priests themselves, or any other members of the clerical
order, are called together in a province by a sentence or decree of the
Governor of the same (provided they are approved as orthodox), they who are
brought into court in their own cases and on account of their own contracts
shall not provide any other sureties than the defenders of the Church itself,
or those who are styled stewards; lest the pertinacious and grasping avarice of
the bailiff may exact other and solvent sureties, and the greatest hardship be
inflicted upon innocent poverty.
(3) If any priests of the Holy Orthodox Faith, or stewards or defenders of the
Church, or other clergy should be found in this Illustrious City who have come
from any other province, and are summoned before your tribunal (which is the
only one before which We permit them to be summoned), they shall not be
subjected to the trouble of furnishing sureties, but they can either become
sureties for one another (which should be done in the solemn way in which
stipulations are entered into), or their bonds or declarations can be given as
security, or their property may be encumbered for that purpose.
(4) It must, nevertheless, be observed that no one should be sued in an
ecclesiastical case, except he who has charge of the poor, that is to say, the
steward of the Church, who has been appointed by the bishop; for there is no
doubt that he should be appointed by him. We, however, order that he who has
been sued shall furnish the defender of the Church as surety.
(5) The officials of inferior tribunals, in all cases where priests or other
members of the clergy are sued, shall not be entitled to re-
ceive more than half of an as,whether the case is tried or not. If, however, an
officer of your tribunal should serve notice upon persons who reside in a
province, We order that he shall not receive more than two solidi,as his fee.
In this Magnificent City, however, the said officials of your tribunal shall be
content with an aureuspaid by residents of a province, by way of fee, no matter
for what sum the defendant may have been sued.
(6) Again, no bailiff shall attempt to annoy members of the clergy with
insults, or abuse, or outrages, or with corporeal injury; and those who do
anything of this kind, after having been deprived of their offices and
patrimony, shall be punished with the greatest severity.
(7) Where, indeed, any privileges granted to a Holy Church of the orthodox
faith, or to those charged with the entertainment of strangers, or
ptochotrophei,whether generally, or specially conferred, shall be perpetually
observed; and We order that none of them, either priests, or other members of
the clergy (no matter of what rank they may be), nor any monks or
ptochotrophei,or those appointed for the entertainment of strangers who belong
to the orthodox faith, shall be subjected to extraordinary charges; for We
think that it is improper in our century for burdens from which We have
released many persons for a different reason should be imposed upon the most
blessed members of the clergy.
(8) Moreover, in order that no one may profit by his rashness, and that the
impudent audacity of calumniators may be restrained, We order that, when those
who have brought suit against priests, clerks, monks, or the other persons
hereinbefore mentioned, either before your august tribunal, or before that of
the province, and they are proved to have done so without just cause, and
lawful intention, they shall be compelled to refund to the said parties all
lawful expenses and costs which they are found to have incurred on account of
the improperly brought action, from the very beginning; in order that those who
are in the habit of employing their time in bringing unjust lawsuits may be
restrained by the fear of proper censure, and remain quiet, and the clamor of
controversy having been silenced, they may, through necessity, become
accustomed to restrain themselves hereafter.

Where legal proceedings are instituted against a monk, or any female inmate of
a monastery, the case shall not be heard before the civil judge but before the
bishop, who will decide concerning the representation of the person against
whom the action is brought; and whether this is done by the abbot, the
superior, or someone else, he shall dispose of the matter according to law and
the sacred rules of the Church; consideration always being had to the respect
due to the party in question.
If this law should be violated, the prescribed penalties shall be inflicted.
Any judge who presumes to render a decision in a case of
this kind, shall, with his attendants, be removed from office, and fined the
sum of ten pounds of gold for having been guilty of any insult to divinity,
which amount shall be paid to Our Most Sacred Treasury. The bailiffs, who have
dared to serve the summons in such an action, shall be imprisoned by the Most
Holy Bishops, in some ecclesiastical building, but they shall not be permitted
to exact anything from them.

Where a member of the clergy is sued in a pecuniary case, this must be done
before the bishop, by whom a decision shall be rendered without costs. If,
however, the nature of the case, or some other reason prevents him from
rendering a decision, proceedings should be instituted before a civil judge,
with due observance of the privileges of the clergy, and no delay in such
matters shall take place.
(1) When a civil judge presides in a criminal case, it shall not be protracted
beyond two months, nor shall the defendant be punished, even if found guilty,
before he has been degraded from the priesthood by the bishop.
(2) Where, however, the crime is an ecclesiastical one, the bishop shall hear
the trial and inflict the punishment.
New Constitution of the Emperor Frederick, Concerning Laws and Customs
infringing the Rights of Ecclesiastics, Coll. 10.
We have decided that no one shall, in violation of the Imperial Constitution
and canonical decrees, presume to summon an ecclesiastical person before a
secular tribunal, either in a criminal or a civil case. He who does so shall
forfeit his rights; the judgment shall not stand; and the judge shall be
deprived of his authority.
(1) We also order that if anyone, after having been notified three times,
should presume to refuse justice to clerks, or other ecclesiastical persons, he
shall lose his office.
32. The Same to Eutropius, Praetorian Prefect.
The bishops, priests and deacons of the holy orthodox faith, who are deserving
of this honor, and whose morals have been approved by perfect chastity, can
acquire and hold as their own everything which they could have acquired and
held at any time while occupying the rank and place of members of the clerical
order, even though they may be under the control of their father, grandfather,
or greatgrandfather, who is still living; just as they have a right to claim as
their own any property which they are permitted to dispose of either by will,
gift, or any other method of alienation; and such property shall never, at any
time, be divided or descend to their brothers or sisters, or the successors of
the latter, but shall go to their children, their descendants, and any foreign
heirs, and shall not be claimed by their fathers, grandfathers, or great-
grandfathers, but by their own offspring through preference. And, indeed this
peculiumshall belong to those who are entitled to it, either by alienation
during the lifetime of the parties, or by their last will at the time of their
death.

The episcopal dignity, however, like the consular dignity, the praetorian
prefecture, the urban prefecture, and military office, releases a person from
paternal authority, and every honor which causes liberation from the curiaefrees
one from paternal control, just as the episcopal rank, although merely an
honorary one, has the same effect. Still, the children of bishops again come
under the control of the latter, after the death of their grandfather, in the
same way as they would become their own masters through the death of their
parents, and not by the present law.
Extract from Novel 131, Chapter XIII. Latin Text.
Every bishop shall have the right to dispose of everything which he had before
he received his bishopric, and also whatever has come into his hands by the
right of relationship, as far as the fourth degree, by his last will, to
whomever he may wish; but any other property acquired by him in any other way
shall be reserved for the Church, to be used for its benefit, or employed in
works of piety. The same distinction shall be observed in the case of those
having supervision of any religious establishment.
(1) Likewise, if any bishop or minister of the church should die intestate, and
without leaving a lawful heir of either sex, the church to which he is attached
shall be entitled to his estate.

We order that priests, deacons, sub-deacons, choristers, and readers, all of
whom we designate as "clerks," who may acquire the ownership of property in any
way whatsoever, shall have the power, as in the case of castrense peculium,to
donate it to anyone whom they may wish, and to dispose of the same by will in
conformity to the laws, even though they may be under the control of their
parents; provided they reserve the lawful portion to which their children are
entitled, and when they have none, to reserve it for their parents.
33. The Same, to Dioscorus, Praetorian Prefect.
We decree that all the privileges which have been granted by the Emperor who
preceded Us, or by Our Own Majesty; or by judicial decisions, or by any
liberalities bestowed at any time; or by custom or by a constitution; or by
surveyors; or which are derived from any other source whatever, for the benefit
of orphan asylums, hermitages, churches, homes for old men, houses of
entertainment for strangers, or monasteries, or which have reference to other
men or property which are under the care of the steward Nicon, a most pious
priest and superintendent of orphans, or his successors, as in the case of
Zodicus of blessed memory, who is said to have been the first one to have
founded an establishment of this kind for charitable purposes, shall always be
observed unaltered and unimpaired by virtue of this formal Decree. For this,
indeed, seems to be necessary, as the support and education of boys and poor
persons depend upon these grants,
and they are destined for ecclesiastical uses, and for the support of old men's
homes and hermitages.
We also decree that the houses and other property above mentioned as being
under the care of the man aforesaid, or which may hereafter, in any way, come
under his supervision, or that of those who may be summoned after him to take
charge of the said orphan asylums, as in the case of the Holy Church of this
Renowned City, shall in consideration of their piety, forever enjoy all the
privileges which are now granted, or may hereafter be conferred upon the said
Holy Church.
34. The Same Emperors to Sebastian, .Praetorian Prefect.
In accordance with an ancient constitution, We order that any ordination of
serfs shall be of no validity, unless the consent of the owners of the land to
which said serfs are attached shall previously have been obtained; and We order
that the said owners shall have power to exercise all their rights over the
said serfs to whose ordination it is evident they have not given their consent
(as has been stated) as in the case of their other tenants, just as if they had
not been created members of the clergy.
We decree that the same rule shall be observed with reference to serfs who,
desirous of a monastic life, have applied to any monasteries for admission,
against the consent of the owners of the land to which they are attached.
(1) We forbid slaves to join assemblies of the clergy under all circumstances,
even if their owners are willing, and give their consent; as the latter have a
right, after having previously liberated their slaves, to open the way for them
to receive the honors of the Church if they desire to do so.
(2) Moreover, We decree that all members of the clerical order, whether
bishops, clergy, monks, or ecclesiastics of any rank whatsoever, shall obey the
decisions of the illustrious authorities of the provinces, without availing
themselves of any privilege1 (provided they are subject to their jurisdiction);
and that, hereafter, the eminent Governors of the provinces shall not be
compelled to go to those places where the accused persons live; as it is not
only in conformity with the ordinary laws, but also with natural law, that
those who are summoned to court by judicial citation should present themselves
there, and not that the magistrates in person should repair to them (which
indeed would be improper); but they must order the trial of their cases to
proceed before judges appointed by them, in the places where the accused
parties reside.

If a slave, with the knowledge of his master and without the opposition of the
latter, is ordained a clerk by the bishop, he becomes free . and freeborn by
the mere act of his appointment. When, however, he is ordained without the
knowledge of his master, the latter has a right, within the space of a year, to
establish his servile condition, and claim him as his slave. But where the
slave, with or without the knowledge of his master (as We have already stated),
after having become free by being ordained a member of the clergy, abandons his
ecclesiastical ministry, and returns to a secular life, he shall be given up to
his master to again be reduced to servitude.
35. The Same Emperors to Sebastian, Praetorian Prefect.
The permission to embrace a monastic life is not refused to slaves who have
obtained the consent of their masters, provided the latter are not ignorant of
this fact. Where, however, they have given their slaves the power to enter a
monastery, We think that they should be deprived of their ownership of said
slaves, so long as they remain in the monachal condition. It is otherwise if
they have abandoned a monastic life, and assumed any other condition, as it is
certain that, under such circumstances, they must be returned to the yoke of
slavery which they escaped by their adoption of the monastic profession.

The episcopal rank releases a person from slavery or attachment to the soil,
but does not release him from his duties as a citizen, or a civil official, for
both of these continue to exist after ordination; so that he must either
perform their functions by the agency of someone introduced in his place, or be
restored to his curia,or office.

Where, however, after proper probation, a slave becomes a monk, he will be free
from the yoke of servitude, for novices must remain for the term of three years
in monasteries before becoming monks. And if they are made monks after that
time they shall be free.
36. The Emperor Justin to Archelaus, Praetorian Prefect.
We think that the admonition should be renewed, and notice should not only be
given to the judges of all tribunals, but also to the defenders of the churches
of this Fair City, among whom has crept the base practice of dictating the last
will of dying persons, that they should be warned not to interfere in such
matters, as no one, in accordance
with the precepts of the constitutions, is authorized to do so, except the
official having charge of the census; and, indeed, it is absurd, and even
reprehensible for the clergy to desire to show themselves learned in legal
matters.
Those who venture to disobey this decree shall have a fine of fifty pounds of
gold imposed upon them.

the Consulate of Justin, Consul for the eleventh time, and Opilio.
37. The Emperor Justinian, to John, Praetorian Prefect.
If anyone, desiring to evade the Falcidian Law, should attempt to leave his
entire estate for the ransom of captives, by appointing them his heirs, in
order that it may not appear that uncertain persons have been appointed heirs,
and the will which he left may not be attacked, We decree that an appointment
made in this manner shall be valid through considerations of piety, and shall
not be rejected.
(1) But when a testator appoints the poor his heirs, and no asylum for the poor
exists, and the poor of a certain church whom the testator may have had in his
mind are not mentioned, but the poor under an indefinite designation are
appointed his heirs, We decree that an appointment of this kind shall likewise
be valid.
(2) If, indeed, he should appoint as his heirs the captives belonging to a town
in which the testator had his residence, and passed his life; the bishop and
the steward shall receive the estate, and it shall, by all means, be employed
for the ransom of captives whether by means of its annual income, or by the
sale of personal property, or of property which can move itself; but, under no
circumstances, shall either the steward, the bishop, or the church profit in
any way on this account.
Where, however, a special heir has been charged with this duty, under the
condition that he shall not claim the Falcidian portion, he will be entitled to
the estate; for why should it be tolerated that what has been left for a
charitable purpose should be diminished by the Falcidian portion, or in any
other way?
(3) When the poor have been indiscriminately appointed heirs, the hospital of
the city shall, by all means, obtain the estate; and a distribution of the same
shall be made among the invalids by the superintendent, according to the rule
which We established with reference to captives, whether the annual income
distributed among them be obtained by the sale of movable property or by that
of property which can move itself, so that land may be purchased, and their
support for the year be provided. For, who is any more indigent than persons
who are oppressed with want, confined in a hospital, afflicted with bodily
ailments, and unable to obtain the food necessary for their subsistence?
(4) Permission to institute proceedings and collect debts should, by all means,
be granted in both these instances, in order that the money obtained may be
employed for the benefit of captives and per-
sons who are ill; for if We have given them the rights and name of heirs,
without, however, the benefit of the Falcidian Law, they must still collect
debts and satisfy creditors.
(5) When, however, there are several hospitals or asylums for the poor in the
place, in order that a pecuniary bequest may not appear to be uncertain, We
decree that the money or the property shall be given to the one which is known
to be the most needy, and this should be decided by the bishop of the diocese
and the clergy subject to his authority.
(6) But if there is no hospital in the city, then, in accordance with the
Decree which We have rendered with reference to captives, the steward of the
Holy Church, or the bishop, may accept the estate; and the money shall be
distributed to the poor who are in the city, or to mendicants, or to persons
needing support without reference to the Falcidian Law.
(7) We order that all these things shall take place whenever no specified
hospital, asylum for the poor, or church has been mentioned by the testator,
and his intention is ambiguous. If, however, he had in mind any certain person,
or any particular religious establishment, We direct that he or it, only, shall
be entitled to the estate or the legacy, without, in this instance, any
consideration being paid to the Falcidian Law.
(8) But in all cases of this kind, the administrators of sacred property must
expect the anger of Heaven if they acquire for themselves any pecuniary benefit
from services of this kind, or if they consent, that others may profit by them;
and do not endeavor to punish with the severest penalty and warning what has
been wrongfully done.
Extract from Novel 115, Chapter V. Latin Text.
Where the children or the relatives of a captive neglect to ransom him, they
can not only be disinherited, but can also be refused succession by law; and if
they have been appointed heirs, the will will only be valid so far as other
items are concerned. Therefore this succession is granted to the church of his
city, and should be expended in the ransom of captives; and there is much more
reason for this if the testator appointed strangers who have neglected to
redeem the said captives; minors under eighteen years of age are, however,
excepted. Those who are desirous of ransoming a captive, and have not funds of
their own with which to do so, but have employed property belonging to the
captive himself for that purpose, can legally act; and even if they are minors
under twenty-five years of age, but over eighteen, they shall, in a case of
this kind, be considered to have attained their majority, and if the captives
should return, they will be compelled to ratify the contract. The same penalty
shall be imposed upon parents, if they neglect to ransom their children.
38. The Same to John, Praetorian Prefect.
As the most pious bishops, priests, and deacons, were permitted under the
Leonine Law to have a quasi-castrense peculiumas well as
to dispose of property by will; it was doubted whether such wills should be
attacked by a complaint as inofficious; and the same question arose with
reference to all those persons who are entitled to a peculiumof this
description. Therefore, We order that the most reverend bishops, priests, and
deacons, who possess quasi-castrense peculiumof this kind, can not only dispose
of it by a last will (which is established by the Leonine Constitution), but
also that their last wills disposing Of property of this kind shall, under no
circumstances, be subject to a complaint on the ground of inofficiousness.
Given at Constantinople, on the Nonesof February, after the Consulate of
Lampadius and Orestes, 352.
39. The Same to John, Praetorian Prefect.
If anyone, when signing a document, should state that he will not make use of
the exception to which he is entitled on account of his calling as a priest, We
decree that he shall not be permitted to violate his contract and deceive those
with whom he made it; as it is an ancient rule of law that all persons have the
right to renounce any provision made in their favor.
We order that this general law shall obtain in all cases which have not yet
been settled by judicial decision or amicable agreement.
Given at Constantinople, on the seventh of the Kalendsof September, after the
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 352.
40. The Same to John, Praetorian Prefect.
We decree, generally, that all Most Reverend Bishops as well as priests,
deacons, and sub-deacons, and especially monks (although they are not clerks),
shall be exempt by law from administering every kind of guardianship, whether
testamentary, legal, or appointive; and that they shall not only be exempt from
guardianship, but also from the curatorship of wards, minors, and the insane,
the dumb and deaf, and all other persons to whom guardians or curators were
assigned by the ancient laws.
(1) We permit clerks and monks who are attached to the holy churches or
monasteries to enjoy this privilege, and do not wander about, or are negligent
in the performance of their religious duties; for We have granted it to them in
order that, having renounced everything else, they may devote themselves to the
service of Almighty God.
(2) We order that this law shall be observed not only in ancient Rome, but also
in this Imperial City, and in every country where the name of Christian is
honored.
Extract from Novel 123, Chapter V. Latin Text.
We permit priests, deacons, and sub-deacons, who are called by the right of
kindred to the administration of guardianship or curatorship to assume it, if
within four months from the time when they are called they state in writing
before a competent judge that they have undertaken the administration
voluntarily.
When anyone does do this, he shall not, for this reason, be subjected to any
prejudice, so far as any other guardianship or curatorship is concerned.
(1) We do not permit bishops or monks to assume the guardianship of any person.
41. The Same to Hermogenus, Master of the Offices.
We decree that ravishers of virgins, widows, or deaconesses, consecrated to
God, shall suffer the penalty of death, as having committed the worst of
crimes, which is not only an injury to man, but also displays a want of
reverence for Almighty God himself. Therefore, those who commit an offence of
this kind, as well as those who give assistance at the time of the attack, and
are caught in the act by the parents of the holy virgins, widows, or
deaconesses aforesaid, or by their relatives, guardians, or curators, if
convicted, shall be put to death. Where, however, after having committed such a
detestable crime, the ravisher is able to defend himself by force, or to escape
by flight, the illustrious Praetorian Prefects in this Imperial City, as well as
the most eminent Urban Prefect, and the distinguished Praet-
orian Prefects of the provinces of Ullyria and Africa, all military commanders
throughout the regions of Our Empire, the distinguished Prefect of Egypt, the
deputies and the proconsuls, the eminent officers of the army, the illustrious
Governors of provinces, together with the judges of every rank who are in those
places, shall exert equal zeal and the greatest care of which they are capable,
to seize the guilty parties, and after they have been arrested for such a
crime, and been convicted by evidence recognized by the law, they shall,
without granting them the right to plead an exception, subject them to the most
severe penalties, and condemn them to the punishment of death. If this offence
has been committed against a consecrated virgin who is residing either in an
hermitage or a monastery, whether she has been appointed a deaconess or not,
the property of the culprit shall be transferred to the monastery or hermitage
to which she was consecrated, and out of said property a sufficient portion
shall be given to her for life, by way of consolation; but the sacred hermitage
or monastery shall have the complete ownership of all of said property. Where,
however, the deaconess is attached to the Church, and does not belong to any
monastery or hermitage, but lives by herself, the property of her ravisher
shall be assigned to the church in which she is a deaconess, and she shall
enjoy the usufruct of said property through the said church as long as she
lives; but the church shall have the entire ownership and possession of the
same by virtue of the grant due to Our indulgence.
No judge or any other person whosoever shall dare to violate this law. The
penalties which We have mentioned above, that is to say, death and
confiscation, We establish not only against the ravishers themselves, but also
against those who accompanied them in the attack and rape. We also subject to
capital punishment any others who may be convicted of having guilty knowledge
of, and of acting as ac-
complices in this crime, whether they concealed the culprits, or gave them any
assistance, no matter whether they are male or female, or what may be their
condition, rank, or dignity, in order that all may undergo this penalty whether
the consecrated virgin or other women above mentioned did or did not consent to
the perpetration of such an atrocious deed.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of December, during the Consulate of
Our Lord Justinian, Consul for the second time.
42. The Same to John, Praetorian Prefect.
We desire that, with Divine aid, everything which is for the honor of the Holy
Catholic Church, and is pleasing to God may be done, and We wish to establish
this by law, and accomplish it by Our own acts. With His assistance We have
already sanctioned many regulations which were in agreement with the doctrines
of the Church, and, at present, after pious deliberation, We intend to correct
whatever, up to this time, has been committed against the fear of God.
It is well known to Us that if either a betrothed man or woman, after the
customary gifts had been bestowed and accepted, should wish to consecrate
himself or herself to the service of religion, and retire from intercourse with
the world to lead a holy life, and continue in the fear of God, the man will be
compelled to lose the property which he bestowed as a gift, and the woman will
be forced to restore double the amount which she received; which seems to be
contrary to the benign spirit of our religious belief. Wherefore by the present
law, which shall remain forever valid, We order that whenever any betrothed man
or woman desires hereafter to renounce the life of the world, and dwell in
association with the righteous, the betrothed man shall receive all the
property which he bestowed as a gift upon his intended wife, without any
diminution whatsoever; and the betrothed woman shall not surrender double the
amount (as has been the case up to this time), to her betrothed husband, but
only what she received as the gift of betrothal, and she shall be compelled to
restore no more than what she is proved to have obtained.
Provision has already been made by Us under a former law, with reference to
husbands and wives who renounce the world, so that if either a husband or a
wife withdraws from marriage on account of religion, and chooses a solitary
life, both of them shall receive the property which was given as a dowry, or as
an antenuptial donation, and only that shall be obtained by way of profit from
the one who embraced the solitary life, which he or she could have lawfully
acquired under the agreement in case of death.
(1) We have determined that the following matters of which We were aware shall
be corrected; that is, if any person of either sex still subject to paternal
authority, or, after having been released from it, should choose to enter a
monastery or become a member of the clergy, and desire to pass the remainder of
his or her life in a religious manner; it shall not be lawful for the parents
of the party in question to prevent him or her in any way from doing so, or for
this reason to
exclude him or her from their inheritance or succession, under the pretext of
their being ungrateful; but all persons, when they make their last will either
in writing or in any other legal way, shall be required to leave them the
fourth part of their estates, in compliance with Our laws. If, however, they
should desire to leave them any more, We grant them permission to do so. But
when their parents are not shown to have manifested their last wishes, either
by will or by any other final disposition of their property, their heirs shall
obtain the entire estate of their parents, to which they are entitled in case
of intestacy, according to Our laws; and their adoption of a religious life
shall present no impediment to this, whether they are called to the succession
alone, or along with others.
(2) We wish those to enjoy the benefits of Our perpetual law who have continued
to remain in a monastery, or in the priesthood; for if any of those with
reference to whom We have established the present regulation, should choose a
religious life, and should afterwards renounce it for a secular one, We order
that all their property shall belong to the church or the monastery from which
they have withdrawn.
(3) These matters having been disposed of in this way, We order that the law
shall be repeated which provides that no Jew, Pagan, or heretic shall hold
Christian slaves; and if any should be found to have done so, We direct that
all such slaves shall become absolutely free, in accordance with the tenor of
Our former laws.
Moreover, We now further decree that, if anyone of the abovementioned Jews,
Pagans or heretics should have slaves who have not yet been initiated into the
most holy mysteries of the Catholic faith, and the aforesaid slaves desire to
embrace the orthodox religion, they shall, by this law, become absolutely free,
after having united with the Catholic Church; and that the judges of the
provinces, the defenders of the Holy Church, as well as the most blessed
bishops, shall prevent anything being received by their masters as the price of
the
said slaves.
If, after this, their masters should be converted to the orthodox faith, they
shall not be permitted to reduce those to slavery who preceded them in this
respect, and anyone who usurps rights of this kind shall be subjected to the
severest penalties. Therefore all judges and reverend archbishops, not only in
the dioceses of Africa (in which We have ascertained that abuses of this kind
are frequent), or in any other provinces, shall see that all these things which
We have ordered for the sake of piety shall be rigidly and zealously observed.
Violators of this law shall not only be punished with a pecuniary fine, but
also with the penalty of death.
TITLE IV.
CONCERNING THE EPISCOPAL TRIBUNAL AND THE DIFFERENT CHARTERS WHICH RELATE TO
PONTIFICAL SUPERVISION.
1. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Julianus, Count of the East.
Even when merchants belong to Our Palace, they must not appear to violate the
laws of trade, and Christian bishops who prefer the true faith must provide for
the assistance of the poor and of those who are reduced to necessity.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof March, during the
Consulate of Valentinian and Valens.
2. The Same, to Claudius, Praetorian Prefect.
If a clerk should have recourse to an appeal for the purpose of causing
fruitless delay, before final judgment has been rendered in a case, he shall be
compelled to pay a fine of fifty pounds of silver, which the general law
imposes upon appellants of this description. We do not wish this fine to be
paid into Our Treasury, but faithfully to be expended for the benefit of the
poor.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof July, under the Consulate of Our Emperor
Valentinian, and Victor.
3. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius and Arcadius, to Neotherius, Praetorian
Prefect.
Let no one hereafter expect other decrees from Our Majesty, but the judges must
execute what We are in the habit of granting. Thus when the first day of Easter
arrives, let no prison have an occupant, and let the chains of all be broken,
but We except those persons by whom the common joy and rejoicing may be
contaminated, and if such are released, We shall punish those who do so; for
who will pardon a sacrilegious person upon a holy day? Who can remain ignorant
of the crime of an adulterer, or of a person guilty of fornication or incest,
when chastity is generally practiced? Who will not vehemently pursue the
ravisher of a virgin during a time of general repose and common rejoicing? Let
no one obtain release from his chains who, by an act of criminal atrocity, did
not leave the dead in peace. Let the poisoner, the malefactor, the adulterer,
and the counterfeiter be subjected to torture, and a homicide or parricide
always expect the fate which he has caused; and let the traitor not hope that
the offence which he has plotted against his master will be pardoned.
We, therefore, limit the number of those who can profit by Our indulgence, so
that they will not have remission of their penalties, except where they have
committed an offence for the first time; nor does the grace of Our august
liberality extend to those who, having received immunity for a former offence,
do not think of reform, but rather of repeating what they have done.
Given, on the Kalendsof May, during the Consulship of Arcadius and Bauto.
4. The Emperor....
We order that only three Praetors shall be elected each year in this City by the
Senate, who shall hear and decide such cases and matters as belong to their
jurisdiction.
5. The Emperors Theodosius, Arcadius, and Honorius to Rufinus, Praetorian
Prefect.
Female comedians, and women who make a living by the exhibition of their
bodies, shall not assume the habit of virgins dedicated to God.
6. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Gennadius, Augustal Praetorian Prefect.
Only Christians can be appointed superintendents of revenue, and of the tillage
of lands, and it is a part of your duty to see that this law is executed.
Given at Constantinople, on the Nonesof February, during the Consulate of
Arcadius, Consul for the fourth time, and Honorius, Consul for the third time.
7. The Same to Eutychianus.
No clerk, monk, or any of those called synoditesshall, by the use of force or
usurpation, be permitted to claim or hold any offenders condemned on account of
the enormity of their crimes. Moreover, let no one hold or defend any persons
who are being taken to the place of punishment, after having been sentenced;
and he who has jurisdiction of the case, as well as other persons high in
authority, are hereby notified that they will be liable to a fine of thirty
pounds of gold, and the punishment of death, if such an unlawful act is not
punished; but if the audacity of clerks or monks is so great that it is thought
preferable to make war rather than to render judgment, let the guilty parties
be brought before Us, in order that the most severe vengeance may be inflicted
according to Our will. The bishops will be to blame (as in other cases), if
they are aware that anything which We have forbidden by this law has been
committed by monks in that part of the country in which they themselves govern
the people, under the doctrines of the Christian religion, and do not punish
it; and in criminal cases, through considerations of humanity, We do not deny
such persons the opportunity of taking an appeal, if time permits.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of the Emperor
Honorius, Consul for the fourth time, and Eutychianus.
8. The Same Emperors to Eutychianus, Praetorian Prefect.
If, by common consent, any persons should desire to institute proceedings
before the bishop of the Sacred Law, they shall not be forbidden to do so; but
such proceedings shall only be instituted in civil matters before an arbiter
who voluntarily presides, and a decision of
the bishop cannot and should not prejudice those who have been summoned to the
trial, instead of having voluntarily appeared.
Given at Milan on the sixth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of
the Emperor Honorius, Consul for the fourth time, and Eutychianus.
9. The Emperors Arcadius, Honorius, and Theodosius, to Theodore, Praetorian
Prefect.
We order that the decision of a bishop shall be accepted by all those who have
chosen to be heard by ecclesiastics, and that the same respect shall be paid to
his judgment as should be shown to your tribunal, from which an appeal is not
allowed. When the case has been decided, execution shall be ordered by the
judges, in order that the inquiry by the bishop may not be without effect.
Given on the Idesof December, during the Consulate of Bassus and Philip.
Extract from Novel 123, Chapter XXI. Latin Text.
If any one of the litigants should, within ten days, manifest opposition to the
decision, the judge of the district shall then examine the case, and if he
finds that the judgment has been properly rendered, he shall confirm it by his
own decision, and shall cause it to be executed; and the defeated party shall
not be permitted to appeal a second time. If, however, the decision of the
judge should be opposed to that of the bishop, an appeal can be taken from the
former. But where the bishop renders a decision between certain persons, in
obedience to the command of the Emperor, or by an order of court, an appeal can
be taken either to the Emperor, or to the magistrate who sent the matter to the
bishop.
10. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Caecilianus, Praetorian Prefect.
Judges shall have prisoners brought before them from prison on Sunday, and they
shall interrogate them, in order that humane treatment may not be denied them
by corrupt jailers during their confinement. They must cause proper food to be
furnished, if they do not have it, and shall assign them two or three pounds
daily, or as much as those having charge of them consider necessary, which they
may charge to the fund intended for the poor, and the prisoners ought also to
be conducted to the baths under a trusty guard.
If the judges and their officers should disobey this most salutary law, they
shall be liable to the fine of twenty pounds of gold which has been prescribed
for this offence; and a fine of three pounds of gold shall be imposed upon the
municipality, if it should treat this regulation with contempt; nor shall the
bishop, induced by the praiseworthy solicitude for the Christian religion,
neglect to observe its warning and cause the judge to observe the law.
Given at Revenna, on the eighth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate
of Honorius, Consul for the eighth time, and Theodosius, Consul for the sixth
time.
11. The Same Emperors to Caecilianus, Praetorian Prefect.
We decree that astrologers shall not only be banished from the City of Rome,
but also from all other cities; unless, having burned all the books containing
their errors under the eyes of the bishops, they are resolved to embrace the
Christian religion, and never to return to their former errors. If, however,
they should not do this, and should be found in any city, in opposition to Our
Decree, or should teach the secrets of their false doctrines or profession,
they shall be punished with deportation.
12. The Same to Theodore, Praetorian Prefect.
We desire Christians of neighboring places to exert themselves to prevent
anyone from retaining, injuring or insulting Romans who have returned from
captivity.
Given on the third of the Idesof December, during the Consulate of the Emperors
Honorius, Consul for the eighth time, and Theodosius, Consul for the third
time.
13. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Florentius, Praetorian Prefect.
If fathers and masters, acting as panders, should compel their daughters or
female slaves to sin, the said daughters and female slaves, after having sought
the aid of the bishop, shall have the right to be released from all necessity
of suffering such misfortunes.
Given on the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Felix and Taurus.
14. The Emperor Martian to Constantine, Praetorian Prefect.
We decree that anyone who desires to bring suit with reference to any church
matters, which are subject to the jurisdiction of the pious Archbishop of this
Fair City, against the Most Reverend Steward (whether the question relates to
ecclesiastical affairs, or to such as are private and connected with the case
of the party himself), or against any other clerk attached to the said
churches, he must state his case before the above-mentioned Most Blessed
Archbishop, who, in hearing it, shall bring to bear both the faith and
sincerity which should characterize a priest and a judge, and his decision
shall be rendered with the acquiescence of both the parties; but no one who
institutes proceedings against the holy churches, or the aforesaid
ecclesiastics, shall be brought against his will before the Most Pious Bishop.
Given on the eighth of April, during the Consulate of Vararus and John.
15. The Emperors Leo and Anthemius to Nicostratus, Praetorian Prefect.
Let no one be admitted to the body of advocates before your tribunal, or before
that of any province, or before any judge, unless he has been initiated into
the sacred mysteries of the Catholic religion.
If, however, he has either done or attempted anything, in any way contrary to
law with evil intent, or otherwise, it shall be your duty to compel him to pay
a fine of a hundred pounds of gold; and likewise, if anyone should venture
surreptitiously to practice the profession of advocate, contrary to the Decree
promulgated by Us, and should perform duties in court which are forbidden him;
he shall be removed from the profession of advocate, and shall suffer the loss
of his property, and be condemned to perpetual exile; and all Governors of
provinces are hereby notified that anyone who, during his administration,
permits anything of this kind, shall suffer the confiscation of half his
property, and the penalty of exile for the term of five years.
16. The Same Emperors to Erythrius, Praetorian Prefect.
When a marriage is prohibited by law, and, after the betrothal present has been
given the woman refuses to marry the man on account of a difference in
religion, and it is proved that the woman or her parents knew this before the
gift was bestowed, they must only blame themselves. If, however, they were
ignorant of it and accepted the marriage gift, and afterwards repented of
having done so, and the gift is returned, they will be released from any other
penalty; and We order that this rule shall be observed with reference to men
who are betrothed, provided the gift has been made.
Given on the Kalendsof July, under the Consulate of Martian and Zeno.
17. The Emperor Anastasius to Eustachius, Praetorian Prefect.
We order that only those shall be selected for the office of defender who have
been initiated into the mysteries of the orthodox religion, and have
established this in the first place by the testimony of their acts, and by
proclaiming their belief with the sanction of an oath, in the presence of a
Most Reverend Bishop of the Catholic Church. We order that they shall be
appointed in this manner, and that they shall be confirmed by a decree of the
Most Reverend Bishop, clerks, nobles, proprietors, and members of the curiae.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Sabinian
and Theodore.
18. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Praetorian Prefect.
Where anyone who is stated in a written instrument to have paid money, or to
have delivered other property, is present, and is charged with some
administration in the provinces, as it will appear to be difficult to make the
allegation that he has not paid the money, We grant permission to him who
desires to avail himself of the abovementioned exception to appear before other
judges, and, by means of them, to show to the other party why he wishes to make
use of an exception of this kind, based upon the complaint that the money was
not paid by him; but if there is no other civil or military official in the
province, or, for some reason, it is difficult for the adversary who opposes
the above-mentioned complaint, to appear before him, and
do the things which have been mentioned, We grant permission for him to file
his exception against his creditor before the Most Reverend Bishop, and, in
this way, to interrupt the prescription established by law.
(1) It is also settled that this proceeding will be applicable in the case of
an exception, on the ground that a dowry has not been
paid.
Given at Constantinople on the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Our Lord
Justinian, Consul for the second time, 528.
19. The Same, to Demosthenes, Praetorian Prefect.
We desire that no one shall be permitted to claim either by absolute ownership
as a serf, or as one belonging to the condition of a tenant, any child that has
been exposed as a foundling, whether it was born of free parents, or to a
freedwoman, or is branded with the reproach of a servile condition. We do not
grant permission to those who have brought up children of this kind to
appropriate them as their own property under any pretext; but children who have
been reared by such persons, or nourished by them, or who have grown up under
their care shall, without distinction, be considered as free and freeborn
persons, and can acquire property for themselves, and transmit to their
posterity, or to foreign heirs everything which they have, in any manner that
they may desire.
Not only the Governors of provinces, but also the Most Reverend Bishops, are
required to observe these regulations.
Given at Chalcedon, on the eighth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate
of Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
20. The Same to Julianus, Praetorian Prefect.
It has seemed necessary to Us to determine in what way rules should be
established concerning the creation of curators for insane persons of both
sexes. If, indeed, a father should appoint a curator for an insane child of
either sex, by his last will, after having appointed or disinherited his heirs;
it will not be necessary for a surety to be furnished, as the testimony of the
father is sufficient security. He who has been appointed in this way shall
obtain the curatorship, provided that, having complied with the other
formalities in the provinces, he is sworn upon the Holy Scriptures before the
Governor, and in the presence of the Most Reverend Bishop and three
ecclesiastics of the highest rank, that he will administer everything justly
and for the benefit of the said insane person, and that he will not omit
anything which he may think may be advantageous to him, nor allow anything to
be done which he may believe will not be for his benefit.
After an inventory has been publicly drawn up with all its details, he can
undertake the trust, and transact its business as seems best to him, his own
property being liable for his maladministration, just as in the case of the
guardian or curator of a minor. When, however, the father did not make a will,
the law will call an agnate as curator, or if there is none, or at least none
that is suitable, it will
be necessary for a curator to be appointed by the court; and, in this instance,
this shall be done in the provinces before the Governor and the most Reverend
Bishop of the City, and the three principal ecclesiastics of the diocese; so
that, if the curator has sufficient property to be responsible for his
administration, no other security shall be given. But where he is found not to
have sufficient property, security shall be furnished by him to the extent of
his ability, and his appointment, under all circumstances, shall be solemnized
by his oath upon the Holy Scriptures; the curator himself, no matter what his
wealth or dignity may be, having taken the aforesaid oath to manage the estate
in a suitable way, and having signed the inventory publicly, and furnished
security for his acts as curator, in accordance with all the legal formalities,
so that the property of the insane person may be administered as advantageously
as possible.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of
Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
21. The Same to Julianus, Praetorian Prefect.
The children of a demented, as well as those of an insane person, of both
sexes, can contract lawful marriage, and their dowries as well as the betrothal
gifts must be furnished by the curator of their father, and the amount of the
same must be fixed in this Imperial City, by the most excellent Urban Prefect,
and in the provinces, by the illustrious Governor, or the bishop of the
diocese. This must be done according to the means of the person, in the
presence of the demented or insane individual, and of those who are of the
highest rank in the family of all the parties concerned; so that, on this
account, no damage may result to the property of the said insane or demented
person, either in this Imperial City, or in the provinces; and all this shall
be done gratuitously, so that a misfortune of this kind may not be further
aggravated by expense.
Extract of Novel 115, Chapter III. Latin Text.
The children of an insane person who neglect to take care of him not only
deserve to be disinherited, but also to suffer the other penalties prescribed
by law. For if, after anyone has notified them, they continue to neglect their
father, he can take him into his own house, and provide for him, and on this
account he will become his lawful heir, although the insane person may have
made a will in favor of his children. Any other provision of the will shall
stand.
(1) The same penalty shall be imposed upon fathers who neglect to care for
their insane children.
22. The Same to John, Praetorian Prefect.
We decree that where anyone holds the property of another, or any is pledged to
a creditor who is absent, and the owner of the property, or the creditor
desires to notify him of his intention to seize it; and he is not able to do so
during the absence of his adversary, who has the property, or who is a minor or
insane, and has neither a
guardian nor a curator, or occupies some high office, and cannot take it by his
own authority, permission shall be granted him to appear before the Governor of
the province, and file his petition and complaint within the prescribed time,
so as to interrupt the prescription. Where, however, he is unable to appear
before the Governor, he can go before the bishop of the diocese, and proceed to
acquaint him with his wishes, in writing.
Given at Constantinople, during the Kalendsof October, after the Consulate of
Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
TITLE V. CONCERNING HERETICS, MANICHEANS, AND SAMARITANS.
1. The Emperors Constantine, Constantius, and Constans, to Gracilianus, Prefect
of the City.
Privileges granted in consideration of religion should only benefit those who
observe the rules of the Catholic Faith. We do not wish heretics to absolutely
be excluded from these privileges, but that they should merely be restrained,
and compelled to accept employment for which the said privileges afford
exemption.
Extract from Novel 119, Chapter I. Latin Text.
Again, the privilege of dowry by which a woman is preferred to first creditors,
as well as tacit hypothecations, and all other privileges granted by law to
women, are refused to those who are not members of the Catholic communion.
2. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Hesperidus, Praetorian
Prefect.
Let all heresies forbidden by Divine Law and the Imperial Constitutions be
forever suppressed. Let no one hereafter attempt either to teach or to learn
any precepts which he has ascertained to be profane, and let no bishops venture
to teach the faith which they do not profess, and appoint ministers which are
not such; and audacity of this description shall not be neglected and permitted
to increase through the connivance of magistrates, and of all those who are
directed to have charge of matters of this kind.
(1) Under the name of "heretics" are included those who ought to be convicted
of having violated laws passed against them; or who, on frivolous grounds, have
been found to have deviated from the judgment and principles of the Catholic
religion.
Given at Milan, on the third of the Nonesof August, during the Consulate of
Ausonius and Olybrius, 379.
3. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Clearchus, Prefect of the City.
Let all heretics know positively that their places of assembly shall be taken
from them, whether these are designated under the name of churches, or are
called deaconates, or deaneries, or whether meetings
of this kind are held in private houses; for all such private places or
buildings shall be claimed by the Catholic Church.
(1) All persons are accordingly forbidden to assemble by day or night, in
profane assemblies, for the purpose of conducting alleged religious services;
and where anything of this kind is permitted to be done either in a public or a
private house, the official who allows it, if he is the Prefect of the City,
shall be fined a hundred pounds of gold, or if he is the Governor, shall be
fined fifty pounds of gold.
Given on the fifth of the Nonesof March, during the Consulate of Arcadius,
Consul for the fourth time, and Honorius, Consul for the third time, 396.
4. The Same Emperors and Theodosius to Senator, Prefect of the City.
We pursue, with exemplary severity, Manicheans of both sexes, and Donatists.
Therefore, they have nothing in common with the human race, so far as either
customs or laws are concerned.
(1) We desire, in the first place, that their offence should be classed as a
public crime, because whatever is committed against the divine religion is
productive of injury to all persons.
(2) We punish them by the confiscation of all their property, and We wish them
to be excluded from obtaining any gift or inheritance of any description
whatsoever.
(3) In addition to this, We deprive anyone found guilty of these heresies of
the power of giving, purchasing, selling, and finally, of making any contracts.
(4) An investigation of this kind shall also extend beyond death, for, as it is
permitted to denounce the memory of the deceased in case of treason, it is not
unreasonable that a heretic should undergo the same sentence.
(5) Therefore, the last will of a person convicted of having been a Manichean,
whether it is manifested by a testament, a codicil, a letter, or in any other
way whatsoever, shall be void.
(6) We do not permit their children to succeed them as heirs, or to enter upon
their estates, unless they abandon the perverseness of their fathers, for We
pardon those who repent.
(7) Our authority is also directed against those who, with solicitude worthy of
condemnation, harbor them in their houses.
(8) We desire, moreover, that slaves should be free who, escaping from a
sacrilegious master, pass with more faithful service into the Catholic church.
Given at Rome, on the eighth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of
Honorius, Consul for the seventh time, and Theodosius, Consul for the second
time, 407.
New Constitution of the Emperor Frederick, Concerning Laws and Customs. Section
beginning, "If indeed God," Collection 10. Last Constitution.
If a temporal lord, having been requested and warned by the Church to purge his
lands of heretical depravity, should neglect to
do so, We decree that, after a year has elapsed from the time of the warning,
his land shall be occupied by Catholics who, after having exterminated the
heretics, shall retain possession of it without any opposition, and shall
preserve it in the purity of the faith, subject to the rights of the principal
lord, provided he does not interpose any obstacle or impediment to their doing
so.
This law should, nevertheless, be observed against those who are not principal
lords.
New Constitution of the Emperor Frederick, Concerning Laws and Customs, Section
beginning, "Believers," Collection 10, Last Constitution.
In addition to the heretics themselves, We condemn those who conceal and defend
them, and are their accomplices, firmly holding that if any such persons, after
having been branded with excommunication, should fail to give satisfaction
within a year, they will then become infamous by operation of law, and will not
be permitted to perform the duties of any public office, or to attend any
council, or to elect others for this purpose, and will also be incapable of
appearing as witnesses, or have the power to make a will, or obtain the
succession to an estate; nor can anyone be compelled to answer them in court,
but they themselves can be compelled to answer others. If such a person is a
judge, his decisions will have no validity, nor can any cases be brought before
his tribunal. If he is an advocate, his services shall not be employed. If he
is a notary, any documents drawn up by him shall be of no force or effect.
5. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Caesar Florentius, Praetorian
Prefect.
Arians, Macedonians, Pneumatomachians, Appollinarians, Novatians or Sabatians,
Eunomians, Tetradites or Tessarecaidecadites, Valentinians, Paulians,
Papianists, Montanints or Priscillians, Phrygians, Pepuzites, Marcionists,
Borborites, Messalians, Euchites, or Enthusiasts, Donatists, Audians,
Hydroparastetes, Tascodrogites, Batracites, Hermogenians, Photinians,
Paulinists, Marcellians, Ophites, Encratitians, Carpocratitans, Saccophores,
and Manicheans, who are to be classed as guilty of the worst of all heretical
crimes, shall never have the power to assemble or reside in the Roman Empire.
Moreover, Manicheans must be expelled from towns, and delivered up to extreme
punishment, for no place should be left them in which they may cause any injury
even to the elements.
Moreover, all laws which have formerly, at different times, been enacted
against them and others who are opposed to our religion, shall always be
observed in all their force, whether they have reference to donations made in
assemblies of heretics, which they audaciously attempt to designate as
churches, or to property left under any circumstances by a last will, or to
private buildings in which they meet, either with the permission or connivance
of the owner, and which should be claimed by us for the Holy Catholic Church;
or
whether they refer to an agent who has acted without the knowledge of his
principal, who, if he is free born, shall be subject to a fine of ten pounds of
gold, and if he is of a servile condition, shall be sentenced to the mines,
after having been scourged; so that they can not assemble in any public place,
or build their so-called churches, and can plan nothing for the evasion of the
laws; and no assistance, either civil or military, shall be furnished them by
either curiae,defenders, or judges, under the penalty of twenty pounds of gold.
All laws which have been promulgated with reference to the army, to various
penalties, and to different kinds of heretics, shall remain in full force, so
that no special privilege shall be valid as against said laws.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Kalendsof June, under the
Consulate of Felix and Taurus, 428.
6. The Same Emperors to Leontius, Prefect of the City.
Nestor, the founder of a monstrous superstition, having been condemned,
remember that it is proper for his followers to be branded with his name, and
not abuse the appellation of Christians; but just as Arians are so called from
Arius, on account of similar impiety, by the law of Constantine of Divine
memory, and Porphyrians, from Porphyry, so everywhere the members of the
infamous sect of Nestor shall be styled Nestorians, as they seem legitimately
to deserve this title, on account of having imitated his wickedness in
deserting God.
(1) Let no one venture to either have in his possession, read, or copy, the
impious books of the wicked and sacrilegious Nestor, written against the
venerated sect of the orthodox, and the decrees of the Holy Convocation of
bishops at Ephesus, and which We order shall be diligently sought out and
publicly burned; so that no one may mention the above-stated name in any
religious discussion, and these sectaries have any opportunity of holding any
assembly in their city, country, or suburban houses, or anywhere else, either
secretly or openly. We have determined to deprive all such persons of the right
to hold assemblies, and they all are hereby notified that any violator of this
law will be punished with the confiscation of his property.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Theodosius,
Consul for the fifteenth time, and Valentinian, Consul for the fourth time,
435.
7. The Same Emperors to Florentius, Praetorian Prefect.
We think that the curiaeof all cities, as well as persons in the army, and those
,who are obliged to perform various duties, either official or personal, should
fulfill them (no matter to what sect they may belong), lest We should seem to
have afforded the benefit of immunity to men who should be execrated on account
of their infamous belief, and whom We wish to be condemned by the authority of
this Constitution.
Given on the day before the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of
Theodosius, Consul for the sixteenth time, and Faustus, 409.
8. The Emperors Valentinian and Martian to Palladius, Praetorian
Prefect.
All those who, in this Imperial City, or in that of Alexandria, or in any of
the dioceses of Egypt, or in any other provinces, follow the profane perversity
of Eutyches, and hence do not acknowledge the Catholic faith, as established by
the three hundred and eight Holy
Fathers of Nicea, and the one hundred and fifty other reverend bishops who
subsequently assembled in the fair city of Constantinople, and which
Athanasius, Theophilus, and Cyril of holy memory, Bishops of the City of
Alexandria, adopted, and whom also the Synod of Epheses (over which Cyril, of
blessed memory presided, and in which the error of Nestor was rejected),
unanimously followed, which recently the venerated Synod of Chalcedon approved,
and which agrees in every respect with the decisions of former ecclesiastical
councils, neither taking anything from, or adding anything to the Holy Symbol,
but condemning the fatal dogmas of Eutyches, knowing that they are Apollinarian
heretics, for Eutyches and Dioscorus, with sacrilegious intent, sanctioned the
most infamous sect of Appollinaris.
(1) Therefore, these men who adopt the perverse doctrines of Apollinaris or
Eutyches are hereby informed that they shall be punished with the penalties
which have been decreed by the constitutions of preceding Emperors against the
Apollinarians; or by the decrees which We have subsequently published against
the Eutychians; or which have been promulgated against them by this most august
law.
(2) Therefore, We forbid the Apollinarians, that is to say, the Eutychians, who
only differ from the former in name, and are united with them in the wickedness
of their heresy, their appellation being different, but their sacrilege the
same, and who do not believe as the aforesaid venerable fathers believed, nor
share the orthodox faith with Procerius, the most reverend Bishop of the City
of Alexandria, to create and have bishops, priests, or any other members of the
clergy, either in this Fair City, in the different provinces, in the City of
Alexandria, or in the dioceses of Egypt. Let the Eutychians and Apollinarians
know that if any of them dare to apply the name of bishop, priest, or clerk to
anyone, they, as well as those who have suffered such titles to be given them,
and who have allowed themselves to retain a sacerdotal designation, shall
suffer the penalty of exile and loss of their property.
(3) Moreover, no Apollinarians or Eutychians shall build churches or
monasteries for their use, or hold any conventicles by day or by night, either
in the house or on the premises of anyone, or in a monastery, or in any other
place whatsoever, for the purpose of practicing the rites of their most
dangerous sect. If they should do any of these things, and it should be
established that they were done with the consent of the owner of the property,
after the matter has been proved in court, We order the house or the property
of the person where the meeting was held, or the monastery, to be adjudged to
the orthodox church having jurisdiction over the territory.
If, however, the prohibited conventicles were held without the knowledge of the
owner, but with the privity of the person who collected rent for the house, or
of his agent, or of the lessee of the land, the lessee, or the attorney, or the
agent, or anyone else who received the sectaries in the house or on the land,
or in the monastery, and permitted them to hold their unlawful conventicles, if
they are of low and abject condition, shall be punished publicly with stripes,
both as a penalty and as an example to others; but if they are respectable,
they shall be compelled to pay a fine of ten pounds of gold to Our Treasury.
(4) We also order that no Apollinarians or Eutychians shall aspire to any
military rank. If they are young, they shall be deprived of the society of
honorable men, and of access to the palace, and they shall not reside in any
town, city, village, or neighborhood in which they were born. If, however, any
of them were born in this Fair City, they shall be expelled from its most
sacred precincts, as well as from all the metropolitan cities of the province.
(5) Moreover, opportunity shall not be afforded to any Eutychians or
Apollinarians to hold assemblies either publicly or privately, or to form
clubs, and discuss their heretical errors, or to assert the false claims of
their wicked dogmas. Nor shall it be lawful for any of them either to say or
write, publish or distribute anything against the Holy Synod of Chalcedon, or
to repeat what has been said or written by others on this subject. No person of
this kind shall dare to have the books, or preserve the sacrilegious memorials
of writers, and if they are convicted of such crimes, they shall be condemned
to perpetual deportation.
We order that those who, desiring to be informed of these unfortunate heresies,
discuss them, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of ten pounds of gold to Our
Treasury, and those who have attempted to teach them these unlawful doctrines
shall be condemned to death. All treatises of this kind, and all books which
contain the dangerous dogmas of Eutyches and Apollinaris, shall be committed to
the flames, so that every trace of their wicked perversity may be destroyed by
fire.
It is only just that a penalty of equal severity should be imposed for the
commission of this monstrous sacrilege, therefore let the Governors of
provinces and their officers, as well as the defenders of cities, know that, if
they either fail to obey these rules which We, by the most religious sanction
of this law, have decreed shall be observed; or if they permit them to be
violated by a display of rashness, they will be compelled to pay a fine of ten
pounds of gold to Our Treasury, and, in addition to this, will incur Our
resentment.
Given at Constantinople, on the Idesof August, during the Consulship of
Constantinus and Rufus, 457.
9. The Emperor Anastasius to Erythrius, Praetorian Prefect.
When anyone belonging to the orthodox religion, by means of either a true or a
fictitious sale, or by any other right or title whatso-
ever, desires to transfer any lands, possessions, or other immovable property,
on which have been built churches or chapters of the orthodox faith, to some
person belonging to a heretical sect, or who entertains opinions contrary to
the orthodox faith, We decree that any disposition of property of this kind
between living persons, or which has been made in secret, shall not be valid,
even if it was conveyed by a vendor of the orthodox faith, or by any other
person under a fictitious title, or under any condition whatsoever, but that
all instruments of this kind shall be void, just as if they had never been
drawn
up.
We also decree that all such lands and possessions which have been transferred
or conveyed to heretics, in any way whatsoever, shall be claimed by our
Treasury; and if the said lands should remain in the hands of orthodox owners
or possessors, or should be acquired by Our Treasury, it will be necessary for
the said churches and chapels to be diligently and carefully restored. The
wisdom of Our Majesty intends to provide that the temples of Almighty God in
which the institutions of our religion are destined to endure, having been
restored shall be preserved with assiduous care through all coming centuries;
for it cannot be doubted that if lands of this kind, on which churches and
chapels of the true faith have been built, should fall into the hands of
heretics, their integrity will remain unimpaired, but they will be deserted and
forsaken, deprived of all worship, bereft of all their accustomed mysteries,
and stripped of all their splendor. No assemblies of the people will take place
in them, and no rites be celebrated there by the clergy; and, for this reason,
the said churches will undoubtedly be destroyed, fall into ruin, and be
levelled with the ground; for heretics will not, at any time, think of the
restoration of structures which they do not wish to remain in existence.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof August, during the Consulate of Boëtius and
Euthericus, 511.
10. The Same to Julianus, Praetorian Prefect.
We have ascertained that there are many orthodox children neither whose fathers
nor mothers belong to the true faith; and therefore, We order that in cases
where but one of the parents has embraced the orthodox religion, as well as in
those where both parents are members of another sect, only such children as are
included under the venerated title of orthodox shall be called to their
succession, either under a will or ab intestato,and that they alone shall be
entitled to receive donations and other liberalities. The other children of
those persons who have followed, not the love of Almighty God, but the impious
belief of their fathers or mothers, shall be excluded from all benefits. Where,
however, no orthodox children are living, the property, or the succession,
shall go to their agnates or cognates, provided they are orthodox. But if no
such agnate or cognate can be found, then the estate shall be claimed by Our
Treasury.
(1) In order that We may not seem to have failed to make provision for children
at the death of their parents (a fact which has
been recognized by Us), We require such parents to support their orthodox
children, in accordance with their means, and to furnish them everything which
is necessary for their preservation, or their daily life; and also to give
dowries for their daughters and granddaughters, and make antenuptial donations
for their sons and grandsons, and in every instance, gifts of this kind should
be in proportion to the value of their estates, in order to prevent children
from being defrauded by the dispositions of their father or mother, on account
of their choice of the Divine love. All Our Constitutions which have
established penalties against Pagans, Manicheans, Borborites, Samaritans,
Montanists, Tascodrogites, Ophytes, and other heretics, are confirmed by this
Our law, and shall remain forever valid.
Given at Constantinople, on the tenth of the Kalendsof December, during the
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 500.
Extract from Novel 115, Chapter III. Latin Text.
The same rule applies to Nestorians and Acephalists, for if any one of them has
children who are members of the true Church, he can transmit his estate to them
alone, either by will or as heirs at law. If some of them are Christians and
some are not, the shares of those who are unbelievers will remain for the time
in the hands of those who are orthodox; and if the former should be converted,
their shares shall be delivered to them, but without any account of the profits
and administration of the same; and if they continue in their wickedness, their
shares will remain permanently in the hands of those who are orthodox. When all
the children are heretics, agnates of the true faith shall be called to the
succession, and if none can be found, and the deceased was a member of the
clergy, the Church will succeed to the estate after a year; and if the owner of
the property was not a clerk, after the year has elapsed, the Treasury shall
succeed to the estate.
Extract from the Novel, "Concerning Statutes and Customs." Section Beginning
"Gazarists," Collection 10, Last Constitution.
We condemn to infamy, set apart, and banish the Gazarists, the Patarians, the
Leonists, the Spheronists, the Arnoldists, the Circumcised and all heretics of
both sexes, and of every denomination; declaring that all the property of such
persons shall be confiscated, and shall not be restored to them afterwards, so
that their children cannot succeed to them; for it is much more serious to give
offence to Eternal than to temporal majesty.
(1) Moreover, those who are found to be only liable to suspicion, unless they
show by proper repentance that they are innocent, shall, according to the
nature of the suspicion and the rank of the person, and in compliance with the
orders of the Church, be considered as infamous and banished, so that if they
remain in this condition for a year We shall condemn them as heretics.
11. The Same to John, Praetorian Prefect.
As many judges requiring Our advice have consulted Us as to the disposal of
litigation, in order that they may be advised what to decide with reference to
heretic witnesses, and whether their testimony should be accepted or rejected,
We order that no testimony shall be given against orthodox litigants by a
heretic, or by those who adhere to the Jewish superstition, whether one, or
both parties to the suit are orthodox.
We grant permission to heretics or Jews, when they have litigation with one
another, to introduce witnesses qualified to testify, with the exception,
however, of those who are controlled by the Manichean insanity, which it is
evident is also shared with the Borborites and those who believe in the Pagan
superstition; and the Samaritans are also excepted, as well as those who are
not unlike them, together with . the Montanists, the Tascodrogites, and the
Ophytes, to whom all legal actions are forbidden on account of the similarity
of their offences. We therefore order that the right to be a witness, along
with all other lawful acts, shall be forbidden to the Manicheans, the
Borborites, and the Pagans, as well as to the Samaritans, the Montanists, the
Tascodrogites, and the Ophytes.
We desire that the privileges of giving testimony in court against orthodox
persons shall only be forbidden to other heretics, in accordance with what has
been already decided. We admit their evidence, however, with reference to wills
and whatever relates to the final disposition of property or to contracts,
without any distinction, on the ground of public utility and necessity, and in
order that difficulty of proof may not be increased.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Kalendsof August, after the
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 532.
12. The Same to John, Praetorian Prefect.
We order that Our Divine Decree by which We have ordered that no one who
accepts the error of heretics can receive an estate, a legacy, or a trust,
shall also apply to the last wills of soldiers, whether they are made under the
Common, or military law.
Given, on the Kalendsof September, after the Consulate of Lampadius and
Orestes, during the second year of the reign of Justinian, 535.
TITLE VI. To AVOID THE REPETITION OF BAPTISM.
1. The Emperors Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian to Florian, Lieutenant of
Asia.
We think that a bishop who, by unlawful usurpation, has repeated the sacred
rite of baptism, is unworthy of the priesthood; for We condemn the error of
those who, trampling under foot the precepts of the Apostles, do not purify
those who have obtained the sacraments
of the Christian denomination by a second baptism, but defile and pollute them
under the pretext of cleansing them.
Given at Constantinople, on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof November, during the
Consulate of Gratian, Consul for the fourth time, and Merobaudus, 377.
2. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Anthemius, Praetorian Prefect.
Where anyone belonging to the ministry of the Catholic sect, is convicted of
having baptized the same person twice, he shall, along with him who induced him
to commit the offence (provided he is of such an age as to be responsible), be
condemned to death.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Lucius,
413.
3. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Florentius, Praetorian Prefect.
Permission should not be given to apostates to baptize, for the second time,
freeborn persons or their own slaves who have been initiated into the mysteries
of the orthodox faith, or to prohibit those whom they have purchased, or have
control of in any way, but who have not yet embraced their own superstition,
from accepting the doctrines of the Catholic Church.
Anyone who does this, or any freeborn person who permits it to be done to
himself, or does not give information of it after it has been done, shall be
sentenced to exile, and to pay a fine of ten pounds of gold, and shall be
denied the right of either making a will or a donation.
We decree that all these rules shall be observed, so that no judge shall be
permitted to punish a crime, when brought to his attention, with a smaller
penalty than that prescribed by law, or not to punish it at all, unless he
himself desires to undergo the same penalty from which, by his dissimulation,
he has released others.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Kalendsof June, during the
Consulship of Felix and Taurus, 428.
TITLE VII. CONCERNING APOSTATES.
1. The Emperor Constantius and Julian-Caesar to Thalassius, Praetorian Prefect.
If anyone, after renouncing the venerated Christian faith, should become a Jew,
and join their sacrilegious assemblies, We order that, after the accusation has
been proved, his property shall be confiscated to the Treasury.
Given at Milan, on the fifth of the Nonesof July, during the Consulate of
Constantius, Consul for the ninth time, and Julian-Caesar, Consul for the second
time, 357.
2. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Hypatius, Praetorian
Prefect.
Where anyone accuses a deceased person of having violated and abandoned the
Christian religion, and denounces him for having given his adherence to the
sacrileges of the temples, or the rites of the Jews, and maintains that, in
consequence, he has no right to make a will; he must institute proceedings
within five years, as has been decided in cases brought to declare a will
inofficious.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
Emperor Gratian, Consul for the fourth time, and Merobaudus, 383.
3. The Emperors Theodosius, Valentinian, and Arcadius to Flavian, Praetorian
Prefect.
Those who have betrayed the Holy Faith, and have profaned the sacred rite of
baptism by heretical superstition, shall be separated from association with all
other persons, and shall not have the right to testify against anyone, or to
make a will (as We have already decreed), nor shall they succeed to estates or
be appointed heirs.
We would have also ordered them to be cast out and sent away to a distance, if
it had not seemed to be a great punishment for them to live among men, and be
deprived of intercourse with them. But they shall never be restored to their
former condition, nor shall their crime be effaced by repentance, or their
guilt removed by the shade of a skillful defence or excuse; as those who
pollute the faith which they had consecrated to God, and, betraying the Divine
mysteries, have adopted profane ones, cannot defend what is false and
artificial. Assistance is given to those who have fallen and wandered, but no
aid will be accorded to those who are lost; that is to say, those who profane
the sacred rite of baptism, for they will find no remedy in repentance which
usually is beneficial in other crimes.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof May, during the Consulate of Titianus and
Symmachus, 391.
4. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Bassus, Praetorian Prefect.
Let the accusation of apostates continue without interruption, and let no
protection of crime of this description be afforded by lapse of time; for
although previous laws may be sufficient for the punishment of such offences,
still, We repeat that after such persons have deviated from the Faith, they
shall not have the power to make a will, or otherwise dispose of their
property, and shall not be permitted to defraud the law by a fictitious sale;
and rights of action with all their property shall pass ab intestato,to their
next of kin, who have embraced Christianity.
We decree that the right of action against sacrilegious persons of this kind
shall be perpetual, to such an extent that We do not deny their heirs
permission to succeed to them on the ground of intestacy, even after the death
of the guilty party; nor do we permit any oppo-
sition to be offered, even when no evidence of their profane belief was
produced during their lifetime. But that the accusation of this crime may not
be too readily brought in case of uncertainty; We, by the present law, declare
those to be guilty who, invested with the name of Christian, either offer
sacrilegious sacrifices, or direct this to be done, and the perfidy of such
persons can be proved after their death. They shall also be punished by having
their donations or their testamentary dispositions declared void, and those
heirs who are entitled to the legitimate succession shall obtain the estates of
persons of this description.
Given at Ravenna, on the seventh of the Idesof April, during the Consulate of
Theodosius, Consul for the fourteenth time, and Valentinian, 426.
5. The Same Emperors to Florentius, Praetorian Prefect.
We direct that he who has induced a slave or a freeborn person, against his
will or by means of threats, to renounce the Christian religion for any
infamous sect or rite, shall be punished with the loss of his property and
death.
Given on the day before the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of
Theodosius, Consul for the fifteenth time, and Valentinian, Consul for the
fourth time, 435.
6. The Emperors Valentinian and Martian to Palladius, Praetorian Prefect.
We order that those who are members of the clergy of Catholic churches, or are
monks attached to the orthodox faith, and, having abandoned the worship of the
true religion, follow the abominable dogmas and the heresy of Apollinaris or
Eutyches, shall be liable to all the penalties which have been prescribed by
previous laws against heretics, and that they shall also be banished from the
soil of the Roman Empire, as has been provided by preceding laws with reference
to Manicheans.
Given on the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Valentinian, Consul for
the seventh time, and Arian, 450.
TITLE VIII.
No ONE SHALL BE PERMITTED TO CARVE OR PAINT THE IMAGE OF OUR SAVIOUR JESUS
CHRIST UPON EARTH, STONE OR
MARBLE.
1. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Eudoxius, Praetorian Prefect.
As it is Our diligent care to guard in every way the religion of the Celestial
Divinity, We specially command that no one shall be permitted to trace, carve,
or paint the image of Christ the Saviour either upon the earth, upon stone, or
upon marble placed in the earth, but
it shall be erased wherever found; and anyone who attempts to violate Our laws
in this respect shall be subject to a heavy penalty.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of Hierius and
Ardaburius, 427.
TITLE IX. CONCERNING JEWS AND THE WORSHIPPERS OF THE HEAVENS.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Claudius Triphoninus.
What Cornelia Salvia bequeathed to all the Jews of the City of Antioch cannot
be recovered.
Given on the day before the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Antoninus,
Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
2. The Emperor Constantine to Evagrius, Praetorian Prefect.
We desire all Jews and worshippers of the heavens, and their heads and
patriarchs, to be notified that, if anyone, after the promulgation of this law,
should dare to attack a person who has abandoned his odius sect and betake
himself to the worship of God, with stones or with any other manifestation of
rage (which We have ascertained has been done), he shall at once be given to
the flames, and burned with all his accomplices.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of the
Emperor Constantine, Consul for the eighth time, and Constantine-Ca3sar, Consul
for the sixth time, 316.
3. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Remigius, Master of the Offices.
It is proper for you to order that soldiers who are lodged in the synagogue of
the Jews, as in the house of a private person, shall leave it, for it is not
reasonable that they should be quartered in religious places.
Given on the day before the Nonesof March, during the Consulate of the Emperors
Valentinian and Valens, 365.
4. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Hypatius, Praetorian
Prefect.
Let the order, on account of which persons attached to the Jewish faith were
gratified, and by which immunity was granted them from curial charges, be
rescinded.
Given at Milan, on the eighteenth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of
Merobaudus, Consul for the second time, and Saturninus, 383.
5. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosiiis, and Arcadius to Cynegius, Praetorian
Prefect.
No Jew shall marry a Christian woman, nor shall any Christian man marry a
Jewess; for if anyone should be guilty of an act of this
kind, he will be liable for having committed the crime of adultery, and
permission is hereby granted to all persons to accuse him.
Given at Thessalonica, on the day before the Idesof March, during the Consulate
of the Emperor Theodosius, Consul for the second time, and Cynegius, 388.
6. The Emperors Theodosius, Arcadius, and Honorius to Infantius, Count of the
East.
No Jew shall retain the customs of his race relating to marriage; nor shall he
marry in accordance with his religion; nor shall he contract several marriages
at the same time.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
Emperor Theodosius, Consul for the third time, and Habundantius, 393.
7. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Eutychianus.
Jews who live under the common Roman law shall appear in court according to the
usual custom, not only in those cases which relate to their own superstition,
but also in such as have reference to the bar, the laws, and the rights of the
people, and they shall bring and defend all actions in accordance with the
Roman laws. If, however, any of them should, by common consent, prefer to have
a case heard by Jews as arbiters, provided the action is a civil one, they are
not forbidden by the public law to avail themselves of their award. The judges
shall cause their decisions to be executed, just as if they had been rendered
by arbiters having jurisdiction.
Given on the sixth of the Nonesof February, during the Consulate of the Emperor
Honorius, Consul for the fourth time, and Eutychianus, 298.
8. The Same Emperors to the Jews.
No person who does not acknowledge the religion of the Jews shall establish a
price at which they shall sell their merchandise, for it is but just that this
should be left to each one of them; therefore the Governors of provinces shall
not permit any of you to fix or regulate the price at which your goods shall be
sold. If anyone, except your chiefs, should venture to take upon himself to do
this, let them hasten to punish him as one desirous of appropriating the
property of others.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Kalendsof March, during the
Consulate of the Emperors Arcadius, Consul for the fourth time, and Honorius,
Consul for the third time, 396.
9. The Same Emperors and the Emperor Theodosius, to Eutychianus, Praetorian
Prefect.
Any Jews who are proved to be subject to a curiacan be delivered up to the
latter.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
Emperor Theodosius and Rumoridius, 403.
10. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Anthemius, Praetorian Prefect.
The Governors of provinces shall prohibit Jews from burning or exhibiting the
representation of the Holy Cross, with the sacrilegious intention of bringing
it into contempt, on the festival day when they celebrate the punishment of
Haman; nor shall they place the emblem of our faith upon their own houses, but
they can retain their rites without manifesting any scorn for the Christian
religion; and unless they abstain from what was unlawful, they shall
undoubtedly lose the privileges which they have hitherto enjoyed.
Given at Constantinople, on the fourth of the Kalendsof June, during the
Consulate of Bassus and Philip, 408.
11. The Same to Jovius, Praetorian Prefect.
The unfamiliar name of "adorer of the heavens" denotes a new kind of
superstition, and such persons are hereby warned that they will be liable to
the laws under which We direct heretics to be punished, unless they are
converted to the worship of God and the Christian faith, and that their
buildings (in which they hold their assemblies for instruction in I do not know
what new dogmas), shall be claimed by the churches, for it is certain that
whatever differs from the Christian religion is opposed to the Christian law.
Given at Ravenna, on the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of the Emperors
Honorius, Consul for the eighth time, and Theodosius, Consul for the third
time, 409.
12. The Same Emperors to Jovius, Praetorian Prefect.
We order that, upon the Sabbath day, and at other times when the Jews observe
the ceremonies of their worship, no one shall either do anything to them, or,
under any circumstances, compel them to appear in court; and they themselves
shall not be given permission to sue orthodox Christians upon those days, so
that Christians may not suffer any inconvenience from being summoned by the
officials upon the days aforesaid; for it is evident that the remaining days
will be sufficient for the purposes of the Treasury, and the suits of private
individuals.
Given at Ravenna, on the eighth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate
of the Emperors Honorius, Consul for the eighth time, and Theodosius, Consul
for the third time, 409.
13. The Same Emperors to Philip, Praetorian Prefect for Illyria.
No Jew who is innocent shall be oppressed, nor shall any person of any creed
cause him to be exposed to insult; nor shall their synagogues or habitations be
burned; nor shall they be maliciously injured without reason; for when any one
of them is implicated in crime, the authority of the judges and the protection
afforded by the public law has been established to preclude anyone from taking
vengeance for himself. But, as We desire that provision be made for the
personal safety of the Jews, so We think that notice ought to be given to pre-
vent them from becoming arrogant, and, elated by their security, rashly commit
some act against the Christian religion, by way of revenge.
Given at Constantinople, on the eighth of the Idesof August, during the
Consulate of the Emperors Honorius, Consul for the ninth time, and Theodosius,
Consul for the fifth time, 412.
14. The Same Emperors to Aurelian, Praetorian Prefect.
When any dispute arises between Christians and Jews, it shall not be decided by
the chiefs of the Jews, but by the ordinary judges.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of the
Emperors Honorius, Consul for the twelfth time, and Theodosius, Consul for the
eighth time, 418.
15. The Same Emperors to Asclepiodotus, Praetorian Prefect.
Jews who are proved to have circumcised any man belonging to our religion, or
to have directed this to be done, shall be condemned to the confiscation of
their property, and to perpetual exile.
Given on the day before the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of the
Emperor Theodosius, Consul for the seventeenth time, and Festus, 439.
16. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to John, Count of the Imperial
Largesses.
The chiefs of the Jews, who govern the Sanhedrim in both Palestines, or those
who reside in other provinces, shall, at their own risk, be compelled by the
officers of the palace to collect the annual tax due from all the synagogues,
in the same manner as the patriarchs formerly collected tribute, under the name
of "coronary gold," and what was accustomed to be paid to the western
patriarchs shall be deposited in the Treasury of Our Largesses.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Kalendsof June, during the
Consulate of Florentius and Dionysius, 429.
17. The Same Emperors to Florentius, Praetorian Prefect.
We order by this law, which shall be valid for all time, that none of the Jews
(to whom all administrations and dignities are forbidden), shall perform the
duties of municipal defender, nor do We permit them to assume the honor of
father of the city, lest, strengthened by the authority of the office which
they have obtained, they may have the power of judging, or of promulgating
decrees against Christians, as well as frequently against the bishops of our
holy religion themselves, and, by so doing, insult our faith.
(1) We also, for the same reason, direct that no Jewish synagogue shall be
constructed of new materials, but permission is given to repair such old ones
as are threatened with ruin.
(2) Hence, any Jew who may have received an office cannot enjoy the dignity
which he has acquired; or if he has surreptitiously obtained a public
employment which is forbidden, he shall, by all means, be
deprived of it; or if he should build a synagogue, he is hereby notified that
he has labored for the benefit of the Catholic Church; and those who have, by
craft, obtained honors and dignities, shall be considered to remain in the same
condition in which they previously were, even though they may have been
unlawfully promoted to an honorable
rank.
He who has begun the construction of a new synagogue, not with the intention of
repairing an old one, shall be condemned to pay fifty pounds of gold, and be
deprived of the work which he is already presumed to do; and, moreover, it is
hereby decreed that his property shall be confiscated, and that he shall be
condemned to the penalty of death, as one who, by his false doctrine, has
attacked the faith of
others.
Given the day before the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of the
Emperor Theodosius, Consul for the seventeenth time, and Festus.
TITLE X.
No JEW OR PAGAN SHALL HOLD, POSSESS, OR CIRCUMCISE A CHRISTIAN SLAVE.
1. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Monoxius, Praetorian Prefect.
A Jew shall not purchase a Christian, or acquire him as a gift, or under any
other title. If any Jew should have a Christian slave, or a member of any other
sect or nation should think that he had a right to the possession of one, for
any reason whatsoever, and should circumcise him, he shall not only be
condemned to the loss of the slave, but shall also be punished with death, and
the slave shall be given his freedom as a reward.
Given at Constantinople, on the fourth of the Idesof April, during the
Consulate of the Emperors Honorius, Consul for the eleventh time, and
Constantius, Consul for the second time, 417.
TITLE XI.
CONCERNING THE PAGANS, THEIR SACRIFICES, AND THEIR TEMPLES.
1. The Emperor Constantius to Taurus, Praetorian Prefect.
We have determined that the temples shall be immediately closed in all cities,
and access to them forbidden to all, so that permission for further offending
may be refused to those who are lost. We also wish everyone to abstain from
sacrifices, and if any person should do anything of this kind, he shall be laid
low with the avenging sword; and We decree that his property, after having been
taken from him, shall be confiscated to the Treasury, and that the Governors of
provinces shall also be punished, if they have neglected to suppress these
crimes.
2. The Emperor Theodosius to Cynegius, Praetorian Prefect.
Let no mortal have the audacity to make sacrifices, and by the inspection of
the liver of the victim, and by presages, obtain the hope of vain promise, or
(which is even worse), endeavor to ascertain the future by means of a
detestable consultation; for he will be liable to even a more severe punishment
who, in opposition to what has been forbidden, attempts to ascertain the truth
of present or of future events.
Given on the seventh of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of Arcadius
and Bauto, 385.
3. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Macrobius, Praetorian Prefect and
Proclianus Deputy.
While We prohibit sacrifices in the temples, still We desire that the ornaments
of all public works shall be preserved. Hence, in order that those who attempt
to destroy them may not be supported by any authority, if any rescript or law
should be produced by them, the document shall be taken from their hands and
brought to Us.
Given at Ravenna, on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof February, during the
Consulate of Theodosius, 399.
4. The Same Emperors to Apollodorus, Proconsul of Africa.
As we have already abolished profane rites by a salutary law, We do not permit
the common joy of all to be destroyed by abolishing the festive assemblies of
the citizens; wherefore, We decree that the pleasures and convivial festivals
of the people shall be conducted in accordance with the ancient customs, when
the public wishes demand it, but that no sacrifices shall be offered, and no
damnable superstition be observed.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of
Paravius and Theodosius, 399.
5. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to the People of Carthage.
We order that all those places which the error of the ancients destined for
sacred ceremonies shall be united with Our demesnes, and that such of them as,
under any title whatsoever, the generosity of preceding Emperors or our Own
Majesty has bestowed upon any private individuals, shall forever form part of
their estates; but that any property which, by various Constitutions, We have
decreed shall belong to our venerated Church, the Christian religion shall very
properly claim for itself.
Given at Ravenna, on the third of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate
of the Emperors Honorius, Consul for the tenth time, and Theodosius, Consul for
the. sixth time, 415.
6. The Same to Asclepiodotus, Praetorian Prefect.
We especially direct those who are really Christians, or are said to be such,
not to presume to employ any violence against Jews or
Pagans who live quietly, and do not attempt to cause trouble, or perform any
illegal acts; for if, abusing the authority of religion, they should display
any violence against them, or plunder them of their property, when convicted
they shall be compelled to restore not only what they took, but also double the
value of the same; and the Governors of provinces and other officials and
principal authorities are hereby notified that (if they do not punish offences
of this kind, but permit them to be committed by the populace), they themselves
will be subjected to punishment.
Given at Constantinople, on the sixth of the Idesof June, during the Consulate
of Asclepiodotus and Marinianus, 423.
7. The Emperors Valentinian and Martian to Palladius, Praetorian Prefect.
No one, for the purpose of reverence or worship, shall reopen the temples of
the Pagans, which have already been closed, in order that the honor which was
formerly shown to their idols and their infamous and execrable rites may be
removed from our age; for it is held to be sacrilege instead of religion to
adorn the impious portals of shrines with garlands; to kindle profane fires on
the altars; to burn incense upon the same; to slaughter victims there, and to
pour out libations of wine from bowls. Anyone who attempts to perform
sacrifices contrary to this Our decree, and against the prohibition of the most
sacred ancient constitutions, can be lawfully accused of the crime before any
judge, and, if convicted, shall suffer the confiscation of all his property,
and the extreme penalty, and the accomplices of the crime as well as the
ministers of the sacrifices shall undergo the same penalty to which he was
sentenced; so that, terrified by the severity of this Our law, they may desist
from celebrating forbidden sacrifices through the fear of punishment. If,
however, the most illustrious Governor of the province as well as the judge
himself, when the accusation has been lawfully made and the crime established,
should, after proper examination, neglect to punish an offence of such gravity,
they shall each immediately be compelled to pay fifty pounds of gold into Our
Treasury.
Given on the day before the Idesof November, during the Consulate of the
Emperor Martian and Adelphius, 451.
8. The Emperors Leo and Anthemius to Dioscorus, Praetorian Prefect.
Let no one dare to examine those things which have been frequently forbidden to
men attached to the pagan superstition, and let him who ventures to. perpetrate
anything of this kind know that he is committing a public crime. Moreover, We
wish such offences to be suppressed, so that, even if an offence of this
description is committed on the land or in the house of another, and the owner
of the same is aware of it, the said land or house shall be confiscated to Our
Treasury. The owners of the property, from the mere fact that they knowingly
have consented for it to be contaminated by such a crime, shall,
if they have been invested with any civil office or military command, be
punished with the loss of the same, as well as with the confiscation of their
property; and if they are private persons, they shall, after having suffered
corporeal punishment, be sentenced to labor in the mines, or sent into
perpetual exile.
TITLE XII.
CONCERNING THOSE WHO TAKE REFUGE IN CHURCHES;
OR WHO CRY OUT WHILE THERE; AND LET No ONE
REMOVE THEM THEREFROM.
1. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Archelaus, Augustal Prefect.
Jews who are accused of any offence, or who are oppressed with debt, and
pretend that they desire to unite with the Christian religion, and flee to
churches in order to avoid the consequences of their crimes, or the payment of
their debts, shall be prevented from doing so, and shall not be received there
before they have paid all their debts, or have been discharged after their
innocence has been established.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof July, during the
Consulate of Caesarius and Atticus, 397.
2. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Jovius, Praetorian Prefect.
For true and pious reasons, We direct that no one shall be permitted to remove
from the holy churches persons who take refuge there, with the understanding
that if anyone attempts to violate this law, he shall be considered guilty of
the crime of treason.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Constantine
and Constans, 414.
3. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Imperius, Praetorian Prefect.
If a slave belonging to anyone, while armed, and without anyone observing it,
suddenly takes refuge in a church, or at an altar, he shall immediately be
removed therefrom, and his master or the person from whom he has escaped shall
at once be notified; and the latter shall not be denied the opportunity of
removing him without delay, but if, trusting in his weapons, the slave has
conceived the insane idea of resistance to his master, the latter shall be
granted the power to remove and take him away by the employment of any force
with which this can be done. And if, in the course of the struggle, the slave
should happen to be killed, no responsibility for damages will attach to the
master, nor will there be any ground for accusing him of crime, where he who
has passed from the servile condition to that of an enemy and a homicide loses
his life.
Given on the Fifth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Valerius and
Ætius, 432.
4. The Emperor Martian to the People.
We notify all of you to abstain from every kind of sedition in the Holy
Churches, and in all other venerated places, in which it is proper for you to
offer your prayers in decent tranquillity, and let no one make use of loud
cries, cause any tumult, commit any attack, or collect or hold any numerous
assemblies in any part of a city or village, or in any other place whatsoever.
For, if anyone thinks that the laws have been violated to his prejudice, he can
go into court and demand the protection of the law; and all persons are hereby
notified that if anyone disobeys, or contravenes the provisions of this Edict,
or attempts to excite sedition, he shall be subjected to the extreme penalty.
Given on the third of the Idesof July, during the Consulate of the Emperor
Martian, and Adelphius, 451.
5. The Emperor Leo to Erythrius, Praetorian Prefect.
We decree that the present law shall prevail everywhere (with the exception of
this Royal City in which We Ourselves reside, and where, if consulted, We
promulgate Constitutions with reference to different causes and persons
whenever necessity requires), and that no one, of any condition whatsoever,
shall either expel, drive out, or remove anyone who has fled from refuge to the
holy churches of the orthodox faith; and that what is due from them to those
who have taken refuge there shall be required of the reverend bishop or
stewards; and persons who either attempt to plan or execute anything of this
kind, or venture merely by thought or action to attempt it, shall undergo the
capital and extreme penalty.
We do not permit anyone to be expelled or ejected, at any time, from these
places or their boundaries, which the provisions of former laws have
established; or that anyone shall be detained, or placed under restraint in any
of the said holy churches, in such a way as to be prevented from obtaining
either food, clothing, or rest.
(1) If, however, any refugees should appear publicly in a church, and offer to
answer those who complain of them, in the said sacred places, they shall be
permitted by the judges, who have jurisdiction, to answer there in such a way
as each of them thinks suitable, the reverence due to the said sacred places
always being maintained.
(2) Let the steward, the defender of the church, or him to whom the episcopal
authority has given charge of these matters, where anyone has concealed himself
in property belonging to the church, decently, and without causing any
annoyance, notify the person who has concealed himself on the said premises of
the church, to present himself (if he should be found there).
(3) When anyone has been notified in a civil action based upon a public or
private contract, he will have a right to answer, either by himself, or (if he
prefers) by an attorney, regularly appointed before the judge who has
jurisdiction of the case.
(4) If, however, he should refuse to do this, or delays, the usual procedure of
the courts, or the law, should be observed. Therefore, if he has any immovable
property, having been summoned in accord-
ance with the solemn Edicts, the delivery or sale of his personal property or
land shall be made, in compliance with the decision of the judge, to the extent
of the indebtedness. If he has movable property, and has concealed the same
beyond the boundaries of the church, it shall be sought for by virtue of the
decision of the judge, and through the exertions of the bailiff, wherever said
property may be hidden, and, after having been discovered, it must be applied
to the payment of the debt in accordance with equity, in favor of the Treasury,
if the indebtedness is due to the State, or in favor of private individuals, if
they are entitled to it.
When the property is found on the premises of the church, or if it is proved to
have been concealed or deposited with any member of the clergy, it must be
sought out by the zeal and wisdom of the Most Reverend Steward, or by the
diligence of the defender of the church; and in whatever way it may come into
possession of the holy church measures must be taken for its disposition in an
equitable manner, either by payment for the benefit of the Treasury, or the
State, or creditors, or any just claimants whomsoever, in proportion to the
amount of the indebtedness.
Where, however, the property is alleged to have been deposited, or loaned for
use, We desire that caution should be exercised in making the inquiry, so that
if it is alleged, solely upon suspicion, to have been concealed by anyone, the
suspected person may be ordered by the authority of the reverend bishop to
satisfy his conscience by making oath.
We also decree that whatever We have ordered with reference to the principal
shall also be observed in the case of sureties, or mandataries, or of property
belonging to them, or to their slaves, their partners, or joint-owners, and
especially in the cases of all persons who are liable in the action; but if the
refugees have taken the said persons with them on the premises belonging to the
church, they must pay their debts with their property, whether they are due to
the State or to private individuals, and the inquiry shall proceed by means of
the church officials, wherever the property has been deposited. This rule also
applies to freeborn and free persons. (5) But if a slave, a tenant, a serf, a
member of a household, a freedman, or any other person of this kind who is
subject to the authority of another, after having either broken or purloined
property, or stolen himself, should take refuge in any holy place, he shall
immediately be returned to his former residence and condition, as soon as the
facts have been ascertained by the stewards or defenders of the church, whose
duty it is to do this after he has been punished in the presence of the parties
interested, in accordance with the rules of ecclesiastical discipline, or the
nature of his offence; or after they have interposed their humane intercession
in his behalf, or he has become secure through pardon, and taking an oath, as
well as through having returned the stolen articles which he had in his
possession; for it is not proper for him to remain any longer in the church,
lest, on account of his absence, his legal rights may be denied him by his
master, and he be supported to the inconvenience of the church, at the expense
of persons who are needy and poor.
(6) The steward, or the defender of the church, must at once make diligent and
careful inquiry with reference to the persons and circumstances of the
individuals who take refuge in the churches, and notify the judges or
magistrates having jurisdiction over their cases and persons, in order that
they may execute the requirements of justice.
TITLE XIII.
CONCERNING THOSE WHO ARE MANUMITTED IN CHURCHES.
1. The Emperor Constantine to the Bishop Protogenes.
It has already been decided that masters can confer freedom upon their slaves
in the Catholic Church, provided they do so in the presence of the people and
Christian bishops; and, in order to preserve the remembrance of the act, an
instrument must be drawn up, which the masters shall sign as witnesses; hence
freedom is not unreasonably granted and ownership relinquished by such an
agreement as any one of you may choose to accept, provided the evidence of your
consent is
apparent.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof June, during the Consulate of
Sabinus and Rufinus, 316.
2. The Same to Osius.
Persons who, with religious motives, have granted deserved freedom to their
slaves in the bosom of the Church, are considered to have bestowed it in the
same manner in which the Roman State formerly was accustomed to do with proper
solemnity; but it was established that the rule was only relaxed in the case of
those who liberated their slaves in the presence of bishops. We, however, make
the additional concession to the clergy that, when they confer freedom upon
their slaves, they may be said to have granted the full enjoyment of said
freedom, not only in the sight of the Church and in the presence of religious
persons, but also when they grant freedom under their last wills, or direct
this to be done by any words whatsoever, so that absolute liberty will be
conferred upon the slave from the day of the publication of the will, without
the evidence of any judge or witness
being required.
Given on the Kalendsof May, under the Consulate of Crispus, Consul for the
second time, and Constantine, Consul for the second time, 425.
TITLE XIV. CONCERNING THE LAWS AND CONSTITUTIONS OF THE
EMPERORS, AND EDICTS.
1. The Emperor Constantine to Bassiis, Prefect of the City.It is part of Our
duty, and is lawful for Us alone to interpret questions involving equity and
law.
Given on the third of the Nonesof December, during the Consulate of Sabinus and
Rufinus, 316.
2. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian-Caesar, to the Senate.
The questions which We have decided in accordance with the reports and
suggestions of judges, or after consultation with a council of the most
distinguished nobles of Our Palace, and whatever concessions We have made to
any corporate bodies, or to the envoys of a province, a city, or a curia,are
not general laws, but only apply to those matters and persons on whose account
they have been promulgated, and shall not be revoked by anyone; and he who
desires to interpret them with excessive subtlety, or to annul them by means of
a rescript which he himself may have obtained, shall be branded with infamy,
and shall obtain no advantage through his deceitful conduct; and any judge who
permits him to appear in court, or hears his case, or suffers him to make any
allegations, or refers him to Us under the pretense of ambiguity, shall be
punished with a fine of thirty pounds of gold.
Given on the eighth of the Idesof November, during the Consulate of the Emperor
Theodosius, Consul for the eleventh time, and Valentinian-Caesar, 425.
3. The Same to the Senate.
Laws shall hereafter be observed by all persons as general ones, whether they
have been communicated by Us in writing to your Venerated Assembly, or have
been published in the form of Edicts; or have been requested either by
petitions or reports which We have voluntarily issued; or where some suit has
required the promulgation of the law. For it is sufficient for them to be known
by the term edict, or be divulged to all peoples by the statements of the
judges; or that they expressly contain whatever the Emperors decided had been
determined in certain cases, and was also applicable to others of the same
description. If, however, the law is styled a general one, or is ordered to
apply to all persons, it shall obtain the force of an edict; and interlocutory
decrees, which We, acting as judges, have rendered, or may render hereafter in
any matter, shall not prejudice the Common Law. Anything which has been granted
specially to certain cities, provinces, or corporate bodies, shall not be of
general application.
Given at Ravenna, on the eighth of the Idesof November during the Consulate of
the Emperors Theodosius, Consul for the twelfth time, and Valentinian, Consul
for the second time, 426.
4. The Same Emperors to Volusianus, Praetorian Prefect.
It is a statement worthy of the majesty of a reigning prince for him to profess
to be subject to the laws; for Our authority is dependent upon that of the law.
And, indeed, it is the greatest attribute of imperial power for the sovereign
to be subject to the laws and We forbid to others what We do not suffer
Ourselves to do by the terms of the present Edict.
Given at Ravenna, on the third of the Idesof June, during the Consulate of
Florentinus and Dionysius, 429.
5. The Same to Florentinus, Praetorian Prefect.
There is no doubt that he violates the law who, while obeying its letter
attempts to destroy its spirit, for he will not escape the legal penalties
prescribed, if, contrary to the intention of the law, he frequently and
fraudulently takes advantage of its words; for We desire that no agreement,
act, or convention shall take place between any contracting parties when the
law forbids this to be done.
We order that this shall apply to all legal interpretations in general, whether
they are old or new, so that it will be sufficient for a legislator merely to
have prohibited what he did not wish to be done; and that it is permitted to
ascertain other matters from the intention of the law, just as if they had been
expressed, that is to say, that where anything is forbidden by law and is done,
it shall not only be void, but be considered as if it had not been done at all;
although the legislator may have only made the prohibition in general terms,
and did not expressly state that what had been done should be considered void.
If, however, any act should be performed on this account, or on account of what
had been done after the law had forbidden it, We direct that it shall be void
and of no effect. Hence, in accordance with the above-mentioned rule, by which
We have decided that where any act done contrary to law shall not be observed,
it is certain that a stipulation of this kind will not hold, nor a mandate be
of any force, nor an oath be admitted.
Given at Constantinople, on the seventh of the Idesof April, during the
Consulate of the Emperor Theodosius, Consul for the seventeenth time, and
Festus, 439.
6. The Same to Florentinus, Praetorian Prefect..We do not wish that anything
which has been decided in favor of anyone shall, under any circumstances,
redound to his injury.
Given on the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of the Emperor Theodosius,
Consul for the seventeenth time, and Festus, Consul for the fourteenth time,
439.
7. The Same to Cyrus, Praetorian Prefect and Appointed Consul.
It is certain that the laws and constitutions regulate future matters, and have
no reference to such as are past, unless express provision is made for past
time, and for matters which are pending.
Given at Constantinople, on the Nonesof April, during the Consulate of the
Emperor Valentinian, Consul for the fifth time, and Anatolius, 440.
8. The Same to the Senate.
We think that it is proper, O Conscript Fathers, that where some exigency
arises with reference to another matter, in either a public or a private case,
which demands a general law, and one not included
among those which are ancient, this should first be discussed by all the great
nobles of Our Palace, as well as your Most Illustrious Assembly, and if it is
approved by all of them, as well as by you, it should be then revised, and
again examined by all met together, and if they agree to it, it should be read
in the Consistory of Our Majesty and be confirmed by the consent of all as well
as by Our authority. Therefore, 0 Conscript Fathers, know that no law shall
hereafter be promulgated by Us, unless the above-mentioned formalities have
been complied with, for We are well aware that whatever has been decided by
your council will contribute to the happiness of Our Empire and to Our own
glory.
Given on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of
Aêtius, Consul for the third time, and Symmachus, 446.
9. The Emperors Valentinian and Martian to Palladius, Praetorian Prefect.
The most sacred laws which control the lives of men should be understood by all
persons, so that their provisions being universally known, men may avoid what
is forbidden, and observe what is permitted. If, however, anything should be
found to be obscure in these laws, it must be explained by the interpretation
of the Emperor and their severity and want of conformity with humanity be
corrected.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof February, during the Consulate of Anthemius.
10. The Emperors Leo and Zeno.
When any doubt arises with reference to some new law, which has not yet been
confirmed by long-continued use, the opinion of the judge is as necessary as
the authority of the Emperor.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Leo Junior,
446.
11. The Emperor Justinian to Demosthenes, Praetorian Prefect.
When His Imperial Majesty examines a case for the purpose of deciding it, and
renders an opinion in the presence of the parties in interest, let all the
judges in Our Empire know that this law will apply, not only to the case with
reference to which it was promulgated, but also to all that are similar. For
what is greater or more sacred than the Imperial Majesty? Or who is swollen
with so much pride that he can despise the royal decisions, when the founders
of the ancient law have decided that the constitutions which have emanated from
the Imperial Throne have plainly and clearly the force of law?
(1) Therefore, as We have found that a doubt existed in the ancient laws as to
whether a decision of the Emperor should be considered a law, We have come to
the conclusion that this vain subtlety is not only contemptible, but should be
suppressed.
For this reason We hold that every interpretation of the laws by the Emperor,
whether in answer to requests made to him, or whether given in judgment, or in
any other way whatsoever, shall be consid-
ered valid, and free from all ambiguity; for if, by the present enactment, the
Emperor alone can make laws, it should also be the province of the Imperial
Dignity alone to interpret them. For when any doubt arises in litigation on
account of the conflicting opinions of the legal authorities, and they do not
think that they are either qualified or able to decide the question, why should
they have recourse to Us? And wherefore should all the ambiguities which may
exist with reference to the laws be brought to Our ears, if the right to
interpret them does not belong to Us? Or who appears to be capable of solving
legal enigmas, and explaining them to all persons, unless he who alone is
permitted to be legislator? Therefore, these ridiculous doubts having been cast
aside, the Emperor shall justly be regarded as the sole maker and interpreter
of the laws; and this provision shall in no way prejudice the founders of
ancient jurisprudence, because the Imperial Majesty conferred this privilege
upon them.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of Decius,
529.
TITLE XV. CONCERNING THE IMPERIAL MANDATES.
1. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Fusignius, Praetorian
Prefect.
Where anyone asserts that he comes with Our secret mandates, all persons are
hereby notified that no one shall be believed unless he proves his statement by
documentary evidence, nor let anyone be intimidated by his rank, whether he
holds the office of tribune, notary, or count, but he must be required to
produce our Sacred Letters.
Given at Heraclea, on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate
of Merobaudus, Consul for the second time, and Saturninus.
TITLE XVI. CONCERNING DECREES OP THE SENATE.
1. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to the Senate.
Although a decree of the Senate has, of itself, perpetual force, We,
nevertheless, support it by Our laws; adding that if anyone should attempt to
obtain a rescript by some special petition, in order to be able to evade what
has already been enacted, he shall be fined a third part of his property, and
shall be considered infamous, as being guilty of the crime of corrupt
solicitation of office.
Given at Heraclea, on the seventh of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate
of Ricomer and Clearcus, 384.
TITLE XVII.
CONCERNING THE EXPLANATIONS OF THE ANCIENT LAW AND THE AUTHORITY OF THE JURISTS
WHO ARE MENTIONED IN THE DIGEST.
1. The Emperor Caesar-Flavius-Justinianus, pious, fortunate, illustrious, victor
and triumpher, always augustus, to Tribonian, the most eminent Quaestor of the
Imperial Palace, Greeting.
Under the protection of God, by whose Celestial Majesty Our Empire has been
delivered to Us, We have been fortunate in war, have adorned peace, and
maintained the welfare of the State; and We have committed Our soul to the care
of Almighty God to such an extent that We do not confide in Our arms, Our
soldiers, Our leaders, or Our own genius, but place all Our hopes in the wisdom
of the Holy Trinity alone, from which the elements of the entire world have
been derived, and their distribution made throughout the globe.
(1) Therefore, as nothing is to be found in all the affairs of men which is so
worthy of attention as the authority of the laws, which happily disposes of
divine and human matters, and drives away all iniquity, and having ascertained
that the body of the laws which has descended to us from the foundation of the
City of Rome, and the time of Romulus, is so confused that it is extended to
infinity, and is beyond the capacity of human nature; it was Our earnest desire
to begin with the Constitutions of Our Most Sacred Predecessors, and correct
them, and render their meaning more clear, and therefore we have included them
in a single code, after having removed from them all superfluous repetitions,
and misleading discrepancies, in order that they may afford to all men the
ready protection of their morality.
(2) This work having been finished, and condensed in a single volume, upon
which We have conferred Our Illustrious Name, We have determined, from a small
and imperfect undertaking, to accomplish the greatest and most complete
correction of the laws, and to collect and amend the entire jurisprudence of
Rome, and place in a single code the scattered volumes of so many authors (an
undertaking which no one else has ventured to either hope, or desire), and
which appeared to Us extremely difficult, nay, almost impossible. But with Our
hands raised to Heaven, and having invoked the eternal aid of God, We impose
this task upon Our soul, confiding in the Almighty who can grant the
accomplishment of things which are absolutely desperate, and cause them to be
completed by the greatness of His power. (3) We have also invoked the
extraordinary aid of your integrity, and have first committed this work to your
care, having already received the evidence of your genius through the
arrangement of Our Code; and We have ordered that you should select as
companions in your task such persons as you may approve of, not only from among
the wisest instructors, but also from the most learned men of the bar of this
Most Noble City. These, therefore, having been assembled and introduced into
Our Palace, and We, having been pleased with
your selection, have permitted them to compile the entire work, in such a way,
however, that everything shall be subject to the supervision of your most
discerning mind.
(4) Therefore, We order you to read and revise the books relating to the Roman
law, composed by the ancient jurists, upon whom the Most Sacred Emperors
conferred the authority of drawing up and interpreting the laws, so that from
these works materials may be obtained without any repetition or disagreement
(so far as this is possible) for a compilation which alone will be sufficient
to take the place
of all of them.
But, while others have composed books on the law, for the reason that their
writings have not been accepted by any authorities, or have passed into common
use, We do not consider these volumes worthy of Our attention.
(5) As these materials have been collected through Our liberality, it is
necessary for them to be compiled in the very best manner; and in order to
consecrate, as it were, the peculiar and most holy temple of justice, you will
condense the entire body of the law into fifty books, embracing a certain
number of titles, following, as far as may be convenient for you, not only the
plan of Our Code, but also that of the Perpetual Edict, in such a way that
nothing may be omitted from the above-mentioned compilation, but that in these
fifty books the entire ancient law for almost fourteen hundred years shall be
included, and, having been revised by Us, be, as it were, surrounded by a wall,
beyond which nothing essential can be found; and that all the legal authorities
shall be granted the same consideration, and no one of them be entitled to any
advantage; because all are not superior or inferior to one another in every
respect, but some are found to be of great weight in certain matters, and of
less weight in others.
(6) You shall not, however, determine what is better and more equitable by
taking into account the number of authors, as it may perhaps occur that the
opinion of one, which on some points is inferior, may, on others, be preferable
to that of a multitude of jurists who are of higher rank in their profession.
Therefore, you will not immediately reject what was originally included in the
notes of Æmilius Papinianus, derived from the works of Ulpianus, Paulus, and
Martianus, whose treatises formerly had no authority, on account of the
distinction of the most illustrious Papinianus; but if you should perceive that
any of these is necessary as a supplement to, or for the interpretation of the
labors of that great genius, Papinianus, you will not hesitate to give them the
force of law, so that all the most learned men mentioned in this Code may have
authority, just as if their researches on the Imperial Constitutions had
proceeded from Our Divine lips. For We very justly regard these works as Ours,
because all their weight has been derived from Us, since a sovereign who
corrects something which is not properly done is more entitled to praise than
he who composed it.
(7) Moreover, We desire you to exercise your zeal, so that if you should find
anything out of place in the ancient books, or anything
that is superfluous or imperfect, whatever is too prolix should be condensed,
and you must supply whatever is incomplete, and regulate the entire work in the
very best manner possible, and if you should encounter anything in the old laws
or constitutions that the ancients inserted in their books, which was not
stated as it should have been, be careful to correct it, and arrange it in its
proper order, so that what has been selected by you and inserted there may
appear to be true and excellent, and, as it were, written in the first place,
and no one will, by its comparison with the ancient works, venture to assert
that the text is inaccurate. For as, by an ancient law which is designated
"royal," all the rights and power of the Roman people were transferred to the
Imperial authority, so We did not divide the entire law into different parts,
according to authors, but We desired all of it to be Ours, so that the
antiquity of their works could not, in any respect, have the effect of
abrogating Our enactments.
We desire that all those things which are included in Our compilation shall
have the same force as if they had been written in the time of the ancients,
and any contradictions which may be found therein shall be attributed not to
those who wrote the laws, but to Our own choice.
(8) Therefore, no opposition (or antinomia,as it is called, to use the ancient
Greek term), should claim any place for itself in the abovementioned code, but
perfect harmony and connection should exist without any contradiction.
(9) Again (as has already been stated), We wish you to remove from this
compilation all rules which resemble one another, and We do not permit those
matters provided by the Sacred Constitutions which We have inserted in Our Code
to be placed there as derived from the ancient law, for the sanction of the
Divine Constitutions is sufficient to establish their authority, unless this
should happen to be done either for the purpose of making a division, or to
render the work more complete, or to obtain greater exactness; this, however,
should occur very seldom, lest, by such repetition, thorns may appear in this
meadow.
(10) Where, however, any laws contained in the ancient books have already
fallen into desuetude, We, under no circumstances, permit you to insert them;
for We only wish those to remain in force which frequent decisions have
established, or the long-continued custom of this Fair City has confirmed; in
accordance with the statement of Salvius Julianus, which says that all cities
should observe the customs and laws of Rome, which is the capital of the world,
but that Rome should not observe the customs of other cities. We understand by
Rome, not only the ancient City, but also our Imperial Capital, which, by the
grace of God, was founded under the most fortunate auspices.
(11) Therefore, We order that everything shall be governed by these two codes,
one that of the Constitutions, the other that of the revised law, which is
about to be compiled in a Code; or if anything else should afterwards be
promulgated by Us in the form of institutes,
the mind of the student of the rudiments of the law, having absorbed its
original principles, will the more easily be directed to the knowledge of the
higher branches of jurisprudence.
(12) We order that Our compilation which is to be made by Us, God willing,
shall have the name of the Digest or Pandects, and that hereafter no commentary
shall be added to it by persons learned in the law, to confuse by their
verbosity the compendium of the aforesaid code, as was done in ancient times,
when almost the entire law was thrown into confusion by the conflicting
opinions of those who interpreted it; but it will be sufficient, by means of
abridgments and a division of titles, which are designated paratitla,to call
attention to certain facts, without permitting any inconsistency to arise in
their
interpretation.
(13) And, in order that no doubt may hereafter exist with reference to this
compilation, We order that no words or headings shall be abbreviated, a
practice which causes many contradictions through its own defects, but that the
text of the code shall fully be written out, even where the number of the
volume, or anything else is given; for We are not willing that these things
shall be indicated by special initials or numerals, but they must be shown by
fully writing them
out in letters.
(14) Therefore, let all these matters be accomplished with the favor of God,
your own wisdom, and the aid of that of the other most learned men as
intelligently and rapidly as possible; so that the code, having been completed
and divided into fifty books, shall be offered to Us as a great and eternal
monument of the" work, aproof of the providence of Almighty God, and the glory
of Our Empire and of
your labors.

Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
2. The Emperor Caesar- Flavius- Justinianus- Alamannicus- Gothicus-Francicus-
Germanicus- Anticus- Alanicus- Vandalicus- Africanus, pious, fortunate,
illustrious, victor and triumpher, ever augustus, to Theophilus, Dorotheus,
Theodore, Isidore, Anntolius, Thalleleus, and Cratinus, most illustrious
professors of the law, and Salaminius, most accomplished legal scholar,
Greeting.
Who knows more thoroughly than you do that the jurisprudence of all Our Empire
has already been revised and compiled, not only in the four Books of the
Institutes or Elements, but also in the fifty Books of the Digest or Pandects,
as well as in the twelve including the Imperial Constitutions? And, moreover,
all those things which it was necessary to order in the beginning and after the
completion of the work, and what We freely permitted to be done, have already
been stated in Our Rescripts in the Greek as well as the Latin language, which
We desire to endure for all time; but as you and all the other professors
appointed to teach the science of the law should know what matters it is
necessary in these times to bring to the notice of students, in order that they
may become more accomplished and more learned,
We have decided that the present Divine Rescripts should be addressed to you,
in order that your own wisdom, as well as that of other professors who have
chosen to exercise the same profession in every age, having observed Our rules,
may be able to pursue the honorable course of legal instruction. Therefore,
there is no doubt whatever that the Institutes should claim for themselves the
first place in all legal studies, because they impart in elementary terms the
first principles of the science of the law. Out of the fifty books of Our
Digest We think that only thirty-six will be sufficient, not only for your
explanations, but also for the instruction of youth; but it seems to Us to be
proper to indicate their order, and the course to be pursued in interpreting
them, to recall to your minds the practice which you formerly observed, and to
show the usefulness as well as the applicability of Our new compilation, so
that nothing pertaining to the science of the law may be overlooked.
(1) And, in former times, as you are aware, out of this vast multitude of laws
which were included in two thousand volumes, and more than three million
paragraphs, students received instruction from their masters from only six
books, which were confused, and contained very few laws which were useful, the
others having already fallen into desuetude, and all of them being
inaccessible. Among these six books were included the Institutes of Gaius, and
four separate ones; the first concerning the ancient law of the rights of a
wife; the second relating to guardianships; and the third and fourth having
reference to wills and legacies; and these books students did not read
consecutively, but omitted several portions of them as superfluous.
The work of the first year was not prescribed for those studying law, according
to the plan laid down in the Perpetual Edict, but indiscriminately, and, as it
were, collected at random, the serviceable being mingled with the useless, and
the greater part being taken from what was of no value.
During the third year, the students read what they had not gone part of the
laws being given to them, with the exception of certain titles; as, after
studying the Institutes, it was irregular to read anything else but what was
placed first among the laws, and deserved this name. After perusing these,
which was not done continuously, but at random, a course which was for the most
part fruitless, other titles were given to students from that division of the
laws styled "On Judgments," and in these the reading was also not continuous,
and the subjects were rarely useful, the rest of the volume being considered of
no value.
Next, they were given certain portions of the treatise designated "On Things,"
from which seven books were omitted, and from those which were read, many
portions were left out as not being suitable, or adapted to instruction.
During the third year, the students read what they had not gone over in both
the other volumes, that is to say in the treatises "On Things" and "On
Judgments," studied during the second year, and the
way was open to them for the study of the most eminent Papinianus and his
decisions. From the aforesaid compilation of opinions, which is contained in
nineteen books, they received instruction in only eight, for the work was not
given to them in its entirety, but only a few subjects out of many, and these
the shortest ones, omitting those of greatest extent, so that the students,
being still uninformed, laid them aside. Therefore, after having received only
these works from their professors, they themselves studied the opinions of
Paulus, and not the whole, but only a portion of them, in a very imperfect and
badly arranged course.
In this way the study of all ancient jurisprudence ended with the fourth year,
so that if anyone desired to enumerate those matters in which he had received
instruction, after making a computation, he would find that, out of so great a
number of laws scarcely sixty thousand paragraphs contained a little knowledge,
and all the remainder were inapplicable, and unknown, and only a very small
proportion of these were cited, whenever the requirements of judicial procedure
compelled this to be done, or you teachers yourselves obtained some idea of
these laws by reading them, in order that you might have a little more
knowledge than your scholars.
Of this description were the monuments of ancient learning, which is confirmed
by your own testimony.
(2) We, having found such a scarcity of laws to exist, and considering this to
be deplorable, have opened the treasures of the law to those desiring to avail
themselves of the same, and these being, as it were, distributed by your
wisdom, scholars may become most learned expounders of jurisprudence.
During the first year, they will devote themselves to Our Institutes, which We
have compiled from almost all the substance of the ancient rudiments, which,
from all their turbid sources, We have brought them into one pure lake, through
the efforts of the illustrious instructor Tribonian, former Quaestor of our
Imperial Palace, and Ex-Consul, as well as by those of you two, that is to say,
Theophilus and Dorotheus, most learned professors of the law.
We order that, during the remainder of the year, there shall be delivered to
the students in their proper order the first part of the laws which are
designated by the Greek term prota,and that nothing shall be taught before
this, since what is first in order can have nothing to precede it; and We
decree that these shall be the beginning and the end of legal instruction
during the first year. We are unwilling that students of this kind should be
called by the ancient frivolous and ridiculous name "dupondios,"but we order
that they shall be known as "New Justinians;" and this designation shall
hereafter be employed for all time, so that those who desire to learn the
rudiments of the science, and wish to receive the instruction of the first
year, shall be worthy of Our name, because the first volume which has emanated
from Our compilers must immediately be given to them. For, while formerly they
bore a name worthy of the ancient confusion of the law, now as the laws are
presented clearly and intelligently to their
minds, it is necessary for them to be distinguished by a different
designation.1
(3) In the second year, during which We direct students to be called by the
name of the edict which was formerly conferred upon them, and is approved by
Us, We direct that they shall be given either the seven books On Judgments, or
the eight books On Things, alternately; but We order that the said books on
both these subjects shall be studied in their entirety, and be read in their
regular course, without omitting anything, because they are all now invested
with new excellence, and nothing useless, or which has fallen into desuetude
can be found in them. We desire to be added to these two treatises, that is to
say, that on Judgments and that on Things, during the second year, four special
books which we have selected from the fourteen following works, namely, one
book of the collection of three which We have compiled on Dowries; one of two
on Guardianships and Curatorships; one of two on Wills; and only one of seven
on Legacies, Trusts, and matters relating to the same; and We direct that these
books which have been placed first in order among the above-mentioned
compilations shall only be given by you to your students, and that the other
ten shall be preserved for a more suitable time; because it is not possible,
nor is the second year sufficient for instruction in the contents of the entire
said fourteen books to be imparted by a teacher.
(4) During the third year, the following order shall be observed; namely,
students shall be given to read the books On Judgments or On Things, as may
seem best, and the threefold treatise on special laws shall be added. In the
first place, the special book on the Hypothecary Formula shall be explained,
which We have placed in its proper position where We treat of hypothecations,
and, as it greatly resembles actions arising from pledge which are included in
the books On Things, the two subjects are not distinct, as the principles of
both of them are almost identical. And, after this special book, another is
given to students, which We have compiled on the Edict of the Ædiles, the
action providing for the rescission of contracts, and that relating to
evictions, with the one based on stipulations for double damages; for when
provision is made in the laws with reference to sales and purchases, it appears
in the books On Things; and as all the matters which We have mentioned were
inserted in the last part of the first Edict, We have necessarily transferred
them to a place nearer the beginning, lest they might seem to be too far
separated from sales, upon which they are dependent.
We have included these three books with the treatise of the most learned
Papinianus, which students were accustomed to study during the third year, not
entirely, but reading them in a desultory way, selecting a few subjects out of
many. The elegant and illustrious Papinianus will afford you material for
study, not only in his Opin-
1 The dupondius,or two parts of the Roman unit of value, the as,was worth
between three and four cents. The application of the term to Freshmen in the

suggestive of ignominy and contempt.  ED.
ions, which have been composed in nineteen books, but also in the thirty-seven
books of his Questions, and his two books of Definitions, as well as his
Treatise on Adultery, for We have set forth all his explanations in the
different parts of Our Digest, and in order that students of the third year,
who are called Papinianists, may not lose their name and the festival
celebrated in his honor, We have skilfully contrived to introduce it again in
the third year.
We have filled the book on the Hypothecary Formula with maxims taken from the
same great Papinianus, so that the students may derive their name from him, and
be styled Papinianists, and be mindful of him, and celebrate his festival day,
as they were accustomed to do when they first began to study his laws; in order
that by this means the memory of the most distinguished Prefect Papinianus may
continue forever to be known; and with this the study of the law for the third
year is ended.
(5) For the reason that it is customary for students of the fourth year to be
designated by the Greek term litas,if they should prefer to retain this name
they can do so; but instead of the Opinions of the most learned Paulus, of
which they formerly read eighteen out of twenty books, doing so confusedly, as
already stated, they must be sure to read repeatedly the ten books remaining
out of the fourteen which We have previously enumerated, and they will obtain a
greater and fuller fund of information from them than they formerly did from
the Opinions of Paulus.
The entire order of particular subjects compiled by Us, and divided into
seventeen books, they shall be required to read, and, in addition, those We
have inserted in two parts of the Digest, that is to say, the Fourth and Fifth,
according to the division of the work into Seven Parts; and because what We
have stated in the first words of Our Rescript will be found to be true,
namely, that young men will become perfect in the knowledge of jurisprudence by
the study of the first thirty-six Books of the Digest, and will become learned
in, and fitted for, every lawful undertaking, and will not be unworthy of our
age.
With reference to the two other Parts, that is to say, the Sixth and Seventh of
Our Digest which are composed of fourteen books, they have been inserted
therein to enable persons afterwards to read them, and cite them in court. If,
after they have absorbed them thoroughly, the students, during the fifth year,
in which they are styled prolitai,endeavor to read as well as thoroughly to
understand the last study of the course, the Code of Constitutions, they will
not be deficient in any knowledge of the law, but will include the whole of it
in their minds from beginning to end; and what almost never occurs in any other
sciences,. which, although being inferior in importance, are almost infinite in
number, has an extraordinary ending in this science alone, through what has
been accomplished by Us at the present time.
(6) Therefore, all the secrets of the science of jurisprudence having been
disclosed to students, nothing will remain hidden from them; but, having
studied all those matters which have been compiled for Us
through the agency of that most distinguished man Tribonian, and other jurists,
they will become great orators and officers of justice, not only fitted to
contend as athletes in court, but also capable of rendering decisions, and
acting as leaders in their profession everywhere, as long as they live.
(7) We also desire that these three volumes which have been compiled by Us
shall not only be taught in Our Imperial Cities, but also in the most
magnificent City of Berytus, which anyone may well style the nurse of the law,
for the reason that this has already been decided by former Emperors, and We do
not wish that other places, which have not received this privilege from former
sovereigns, should enjoy it; and as We have learned that certain men of little
learning are teaching false legal doctrines to the students of the most
polished City of Alexandria, as well as to those of Caesarea and other places,
We hereby notify them to desist from this undertaking, with the warning that if
they should dare hereafter to commit such an offence, and give such instruction
outside of the Imperial Cities and the metropolis of Berytus, they shall be
punished with a fine of ten pounds of gold, and be expelled from the city in
which they do not teach the laws, but violate them.
(8) We now repeat what We stated in Our Rescripts, when, in the beginning, We
ordered this work to be performed, and which, after its completion, We
mentioned in another of Our Constitutions, namely, that no one of those who
write commentaries on books shall place any abbreviations in these, or by any
compilation shall cause any difference to arise in the interpretation or
composition of the laws; and all copyists who commit this offence hereafter,
shall, after having undergone the penalty prescribed for the crime, pay double
the value of the book to the owner of the same, if they sold it to him when he
was ignorant of the fact; for anyone who buys a book of this kind cannot make
use of it, because no judge will permit citations to be made from its pages,
but will order that it shall be considered as not having been written.
(9) We decree that it is necessary to issue a warning to be enforced with
severe penalties, in order that no one of those who are pursuing the study of
the law, either in this Most Splendid City, or in the celebrated town of
Berytus, shall presume to indulge in unworthy and contemptible sports, which in
fact are more appropriate to the servile condition, and by means of which
injury may be caused; or to commit any offence against their professors or
fellow-students, and especially against those who, being inexperienced, have
come for the purpose of studying law. For who calls those acts sports from
which crimes arise?
We do not, under any circumstances, permit things of this kind to be done, for
We wish this part of the course to be pursued with the best order possible,
during Our reign, and to have the minds of the students transmitted to
posterity properly formed, and their tongues properly instructed.
(10) The distinguished Prefect of this Fair City shall see that all these rules
are observed in this Most Magnificent Capital, and
that punishment for their violation is inflicted, so far as the nature of the
offence, and the rank of the youths and copyists demand. In the City of
Berytus, the most illustrious Governor of maritime Phoenicia, as well as the
Most Blessed Bishop of that city, together with the professors of law, shall be
charged with this responsibility.
(11) Therefore, begin to teach the science of jurisprudence under the guidance
of God, and open the way which We have found, in order that the students may
become excellent ministers of justice, and of the State, and great honor will
be yours, for all time 1; because such a
1 As already mentioned, the Roman bar deduced its origin from the intimate
association of patron and client in the days of the Republic. This relation,
founded upon mutual support and assistance, bore a considerable resemblance to
that of lord and vassal during the Middle Ages, without, however, including the
oppressive restrictions imposed upon the latter by the laws of Feudalism.
No regular formula was required for the substitution of a procuratorto conduct
a suit; and, indeed, it is said by Gaius that he could be selected without the
knowledge of the adversary.
The cognitorwas appointed by the use of an obligatory formula, in the presence
of the adverse party to the action, but his own presence was not requisite. The
rules of practice compelled notice of the employment of an advocate to be
served upon an opponent. The cognitorand the advocate, being persons learned in
the law, either conducted the cases of their clients, or, if the latter
preferred to do so themselves, assisted them with their advice, and prompted
them as associate counsel during the trial. In subsequent times, advocates were
organized into a corporation; their qualifications were rigidly prescribed; the
number assigned to the different tribunals was specified; and the fees they
were permitted to receive were limited by law. A severe and searching
examination preceded their admission; and while they enjoyed many rights and
privileges as members of an honorable profession, their responsibility for the
faithful discharge of their official duties was never lost sight of.
The course of instruction prescribed for admission to the Roman bar differed
from that of modern times in that it was much more practical. Reading the
various treatises constituted but a small and comparatively unimportant part of
a legal education.
The argument of points on every imaginable subject connected with the theory of
the law and the administration of justice was exacted of the student in his
daily routine. Cicero emphasizes the fact that the mere acquisition of
knowledge was not sufficient, but that discussion of the questions propounded
was of vital importance, and he also states that it must be varied, in order
that it may not become tedious and uninteresting. "Iam illud videmus nequaquam
satis esse reperire quid dicas, nisi id inventum tractare possis. Tractatio
autem varia esse debet, ne aut cognoscat artem qui audiat aut defetigetur
similitudinis satietate," (De Oratore,41.)
He also indicates that the systematic classification of the different topics of
jurisprudence, their definition of what is ambiguous, the interpretation of
what is obscure, the establishment of rules by which the true and the false may
be distinguished, and the exclusion of everything immaterial, are absolutely
essential; and that to the practice of this method the success and eminence of
Scaevola the other great jurists of former times were largely to be attributed.
"Iuris civilis magnum usum et apud Scaevolam et apud multos fuisse, artem in hoc
uno; quod numquam effecisset ipsium iuris scientia, nisi eam praeterea
didicisset, artem, quae doceret rem universam tribuere in partis, latentem
explicare definiendo, obscuram explanare interpretando, ambigua primum videre,
deinde distinguere, postremo habere regulam, qua vera et falsa iudicarentur et
quae quibus propositis essent quaeque non essent consequentia." (Ibid.,
Brutus,41.)
The responsa prudentum,or opinions of persons learned in jurisprudence, which
were promulgated as the result of consultation by clients, or in answer to the
demands of the Emperor, or the high officials of the State, were another source
change has occurred in your age as Glaucus and Diomedes made with one another
in Homer, the father of all excellence, by exchanging things that were
dissimilar: "Gold for copper, and articles worth a hundred for others worth
nine."
We order that these rules, without distinction, shall be observed in all ages,
by professors and students of law, as well as by copyists, and the judges
themselves.

The providence of Divine Goodness with reference to Us is so great that it
considers Us worthy to always be preserved by its eternal favors. For a lasting
peace was secured after the Parthian War, and
of legal knowledge afforded the diligent and ambitious student. Cicero refers
to Scaevola as permitting candidates for the bar to be present when he gave his
conclusions on points which had been submitted to him for determination, as
follows: "Ego autem iuris civilis studio multum operae dabam Q. Scaevolae Q. F.
qui quamquam nemini se ad docendum dabat, tamen consulentibus respondendo
studiosos audiendi docebat." (Ibid., Loc. cit.89.)
Of the great law schools of Rome, Constantinople, and Berytus, that of Berytus
stood pre-eminent. So well acknowledged was its superiority that it was known
throughout the Empire as the "Mother of the Laws" (mhi/hr tw~n no/mwn). Not
only were its professors called upon for legal advice, and the interpretation
of ambiguous enactments by the highest civil dignitaries of the province, but
their services were frequently required by the sovereign in the Imperial
audience-room of the Byzantine capital.
In the early ages of legal practice, all that was necessary to authorize the
appearance of an advocate as the representative of his client was the
establishment of the fact that he was his patron.
It is said by Pliny (Epistles II, 14), that formerly young men, no matter how
eminent their rank, were not allowed to perform the duties of advocates before
the centumviral court, unless they had previously been introduced by a citizen
of consular dignity. Examinations were not considered necessary until the
organization of the bar into a corporate body, and the recognition of its
members as officers of the judicial tribunals, as is done to-day. The admission
of candidates was gratuitous.
The rule governing privileged communications was recognized by Roman courts and
lawyers as binding, and no information obtained in a professional capacity
could be introduced as evidence in the hearing of a cause.
The Imperial Procurators and Advocates of the Treasury were the legal
representatives of the government, their functions being similar to those of
modern attorneys- and solicitors-general.
With the decline of the Empire, the Roman bar did not escape contamination, and
finally fell into such disrepute that men of integrity and reputation were
ashamed to be known as members of it. Cicero has told us in what estimation the
lawyer was held by the public during the age in which he lived: "Ha est tibi
juris consultus ipse per se nihil nisi leguleius quidam cautus et acutus, praeco
actionum, cantor formularum, auceps syllabarum." (De OratoreI, 55, 236.)  ED.
the defeat of the nation of the Vandals; Carthage, nay more, all Lybia, was
united with the Roman Empire for the second time; and in addition to this, God
has given Us the opportunity, through Our diligence of compiling into a new and
fairer form the ancient laws already oppressed with age, a task which before
Our reign no one ever expected to see accomplished, and one hardly considered
possible of attainment by human power. For it was, indeed, a wonderful
undertaking to reduce to harmony all the Roman laws existing from the
foundation of the City to Our reign, a period embracing almost fourteen hundred
years, and diversified with domestic contests, and to extend this compilation
so as to include the Imperial Constitutions in such a way that no
contradiction, repetition, or resemblance, can be found in it, and no two laws
enacted with reference to the same matter shall ever appear; for this task,
indeed, is one which belongs to Divine Providence, and could, under no
circumstances, be accomplished by human weakness.
Hence We, as is customary, have had recourse to the protection of immortality,
and having invoked the Holy name of God, We have chosen to constitute Him the
author and head of the entire work; and have entrusted its execution to that
illustrious man Tribonian, Master of the Offices, Ex-Quaestor of our Sacred
Palace and Ex-Consul; and to him We have committed the supervision of this
undertaking, so that he himself, together with other eminent and most learned
men, may accomplish Our desire; and that Our Majesty, with the assistance of
Heaven, by constantly investigating and carefully examining the compilations
made by the persons above mentioned, can correct and place in proper form
anything found to be ambiguous and uncertain.
(1) Therefore, everything having been completed, and Our Lord God Jesus Christ
having bestowed upon Us and Our officers the possibility of success, We have
collected the principal constitutions in twelve books, which had already been
included in the Code under Our name. Afterwards, however, having planned a
still greater work, We permitted the ancient learned treatises on the law,
already confused and scattered, to be collected and revised by the same
distinguished man. As, however, We require an exact account of all this labor,
it was suggested by the above-named distinguished jurist, that as almost two
thousand books had been written on this subject, and more than three millions
of paragraphs had been promulgated by the ancient authorities, it would be
necessary to read, and carefully examine all of them, in order to select
whatever might be best. This finally has been accomplished by means of
celestial light and the favor of the Holy Trinity, in accordance with Our
orders, which, in the beginning, We gave the above-mentioned distinguished man;
and everything which is useful has been collected in fifty books, all
ambiguities have been removed, and nothing which could cause difficulty having
been suffered to remain, the title of the Digest or Pandects, which contain the
legal arguments and decisions, and everything which has been collected from all
sources, has been given to them; the entire work including almost a hundred and
fifty thousand paragraphs.
We have not incorrectly or unreasonably divided the work into seven parts, as
We had in mind the nature and mysterious signification of these numbers, and
have made a division of the different parts in conformity with them.
(2) Hence, the First Part of the series, which is called by the Greeks prota,is
divided into four books.
(3) The second contains seven books, which are designated "Concerning
Judgments."
(4) In the third collection We have placed all those matters which have
reference to Things, and they are discussed in eight books.
(5) The fourth division, which is, as it were, the centre of the entire
compilation, includes eight books, in which everything relating to
hypothecation is embraced, so as not to be far from actions based upon pledge,
which are treated of in the book On Things. Another book has been inserted in
the same volume which includes the Edict of the Ædiles; the action for the
rescission of contracts; and stipulations for double damages, in case of
eviction; because all these things are included under the head of purchase and
sale, and the aforesaid actions, so to speak, originate from them.
In the ancient arrangement of the Edict these subjects had been treated of in
different places, and separated from one another, but now they have been
collected and united through Our foresight; as it was necessary that matters
which have reference to almost the same subjects should be placed in
juxtaposition. Therefore, another book relating to interest, money advanced for
the transportation of merchandise, documents, witnesses and evidence, as well
as presumptions, has been added by Us to the first two, and the three special
books above mentioned have been inserted near the Part treating of Things.
After these, We have placed whatever has been mentioned with reference to the
laws regulating betrothals, marriages, or dowries, and these we have included
in three books. We have, moreover, written two books on guardianships and
curatorships, and have placed the above-mentioned Part, embracing eight books,
in the centre of the work, as containing the most useful and best decisions
collected from all sources.
(6) The fifth part of the Digest is entitled, "Concerning Wills," in which
whatever rules have been established by the ancients with regard to the wills
and codicils of civilians as well as of soldiers, has been inserted. Five books
on legacies and trusts have also been added, and as it was not improper for the
description of the Falcidian Law to be included in the treatises on legacies
and trusts, and for the book on the Trebellian Decree of the Senate to be
added, this was done, and the entire Fifth Part has been divided into nine
books.
We have, however, thought that the Trebellian Decree of the Senate should alone
be included, having rejected the captious subterfuges of the Pegasian Decree of
the Senate, which were odious to the ancient authorities themselves; and having
also omitted the superfluous and frivolous difference of the two degrees, We
have ascribed to the Trebellian Decree of the Senate everything which was
formerly included
in both. Nothing, however, has been mentioned by Us in these books with
reference to laws governing estates without owners, in order that, where
affairs are not prosperous, there may be no cause for the increase of the
calamities of the Roman people that, flourishing in civil war, have continued
to exist in Our reign, an epoch which the favor of Heaven has strengthened with
the security of peace, and rendered Us victorious over all nations, and in
order that no mournful monument may cast its shadow over a joyful age.
(7) Next conies the Sixth Part of the Digest, in which praetorian possession of
property which has reference to freeborn persons, as well as to freedmen, is
embraced; so that the law which treats of degrees of relationship and affinity,
legal inheritances, and intestate successions, under the Tertullian and
Orphitian Decrees of the Senate, by which a mother and her children become
heirs to one another, has been placed by Us in two books; We having reduced to
a clear and concise arrangement the multitude of decisions relating to the
praetorian possession of estates.
Next, We have compiled in a single book all decisions by the ancient
authorities pertaining to notices of the construction of new works, wrongful
damage, both concerning buildings which threaten to fall, as well as provisions
made for taking care of rain-water, besides whatever We have found that the
laws prescribed with reference to farmers of the revenue and donations, both
those inter vivosand mortis causa.
Again, another book treats of manumissions and cases where freedom is involved,
as well as many and various opinions relating to the acquisition of ownership,
and the possession of property; and the titles under which these are contained
are inserted in a single volume. In another book, those who have had judgment
rendered against them, as well as those who have confessed in court are
discussed, and the seizure and sale of property to prevent defrauding
creditors, is treated of.
In the next place, interdicts of every description are combined, and after them
come exceptions and prescriptions. Another book includes obligations and
actions, so that the above-mentioned Sixth Part of the entire Digest is
comprised of eight books.
(8) The Seventh and last Part of the Digest consists of six books which include
everything relating to stipulations or verbal obligations, sureties and
mandators, as well as novations, payments, releases, and praetorian
stipulations; all of this being included in two volumes which it was not
possible to enumerate in the ancient books on account of their multitude.
Next in order come two terrible books on private offences and extraordinary
public crimes, which contain all the severity and atrocity which characterizes
their penalties. Mingled with them are also provisions with reference to
audacious men, who, by contumacy, endeavor to conceal themselves to escape
punishment; and also concerning penalties inflicted upon condemned persons, or
of concessions granted in their stead as well as the nature of the same. One
book,
having reference to appeals taken against final decisions in both civil and
criminal cases, has been composed by Us. All other matters pertaining to
municipal magistrates, or to decurions, public employments or works, markets,
liabilities contracted by promises, various judicial inquiries, the valuation
of property, and the signification of terms as established by the ancients, and
which have been regularly defined, are embraced in the fiftieth and last book
of the entire compilation.
(9) All these things have been accomplished by the distinguished man and most
learned Master, Ex-Quaestor, and Ex-Consul Tribonian, equally accomplished in
the art of eloquence and the science of the law, prominent in knowledge of
affairs, who has never considered anything of greater importance or dearer to
his heart than obedience to Our commands. The work has also been perfected by
other illustrious and most accomplished men, that is to say, the eminent
Constantine, Count of the Sacred Largesses, and Master of Requests, who has
always commended himself to Us on account of the good opinion We have had of
him, and of his glory; and Theophilus, a brilliant man, and learned jurist of
this Most Splendid City, who in a praiseworthy manner discharged his duty as
expounder of the laws; and Dorotheus, an eminent man and a most capable Quaestor
whom We have called to Our aid, while he was teaching students the laws in that
magnificent City of Berytus, on account of his excellent reputation and
distinction; and We have also made Anatolius, another illustrious man, a
participant in this work, who himself was appointed interpreter of the law
among the people of Berytus, and, having sprung from an ancient race of
lawyers, was summoned to this task, for his father Leontius, and his
grandfather Eudoxius, left behind them a distinguished and memorable reputation
for legal knowledge, having succeeded Patricius of famous memory, as Quaestor
and professor; and Leontius, a most eminent prefect of consular rank, and
Patricius his son, along with Cratinus, an illustrious man, Count of the Sacred
Largesses, and a distinguished teacher of this Fair City, all of whom have been
selected for the above-mentioned undertaking; together with Stephen, Menna,
Prosdocius, Eutolmius, Timotheus, Leonidas, Leontius, Plato, James,
Constantine, and John, men deeply learned in the law, who are employed in cases
before the Grand Tribunal of the Prefecture, which takes precedence over all
oriental praetorian jurisdictions.
These persons, having received on every hand the universal testimony of their
worth, were selected by Us for the execution of this undertaking of such vast
importance, and all, having assembled under the supervision of the
distinguished Tribonian, in order that they might accomplish this work under
Our auspices, and with the favor of God, it has been completed in the fifth
books aforesaid.
(10) We have so much reverence for antiquity that We can, under no
circumstances, endure that the names of persons learned in jurisprudence shall
be abandoned to oblivion, but each one of them who was the author of the law is
mentioned in Our Digest, and this has only been done by Us in order that if
anything in these enactments
should appear to be either superfluous, imperfect, or inapplicable, it may
receive the necessary addition or diminution, and may be handed down with the
most accurate laws; and where many points which are similar are opposed to one
another, that which appears to be the most correct shall be preferred to the
others, and the same authority conferred upon all; so that whatever is written
therein may appear to be Ours and composed by Our direction; and no one shall
be so bold as to compare the laws which antiquity possessed with those which
Our authority introduced, for the reason that many of great importance have
been changed on account of their usefulness to such an extent that even where
an Imperial Constitution appeared in the old books, We have not spared it, but
have thought that it should be amended and improved; but the names of the
ancient legislators have been left, and whatever was proper and necessary for
the truth of jurisprudence We have preserved with Our corrections; and
therefore where any ambiguity existed between them, We have explained it
perfectly, without permitting any doubt whatever to remain.
(11) But as We have recognized the fact that ignorant men are not suitable for
the accomplishment of a task requiring so much wisdom and that those who,
standing in the vestibule of legal learning, may hasten to enter still further,
We have decided that another moderate amendment should be prepared, so that
those who are inclined to this study, and are, as it were, imbued with its
principles, can penetrate its secret recesses, and view with open eyes the most
excellent form of the laws; and We have therefore directed Tribonian, that
eminent man, who has been selected for the supervision of the entire
undertaking; along with Theophilus and Dorotheus, illustrious, and most learned
professors of the law, who have been summoned for this purpose, to collect
separately all the books that the ancients composed, which contained the first
principles of jurisprudence, and are called "Institutes," and to take from them
whatever might be useful, most appropriate, and adaptable to the practice of
the present time; and that all found to be available should be carefully
combined and arranged in four books, placing together the original foundations
and elements of legal knowledge, supported by which young men could obtain a
more extensive and perfect acquaintance with the laws.
We have, however, admonished them to be mindful of Our Constitutions which We
have promulgated for the amendment of the law, and not to delay to insert them
in the work (so that what was formerly ambiguous may be clear), as well as what
was afterwards established.
This work, having been completed by them, has been offered to, and gone over as
indisputable again by Us, and We have accepted it with willing mind, and
decided that it is not unworthy of Our plan; and We have ordered that the
aforesaid books shall be considered constitutions as was plainly stated in Our
Decree, prefixed to the said books.
(12) Therefore, this compilation of the Roman law having been finished, and
perfected in three parts, namely, the Institutes, the Digest or Pandects, and
the Constitutions, and the task having been
completed in three years, which, when it was originally undertaken, was not
expected to be terminated in ten, We have given thanks to Almighty God who has
offered us the opportunity to fortunately carry on war, as well as to enjoy an
honorable peace, and to formulate a most excellent system of laws, not only for
the use of the present age but for that of those which shall come hereafter,
and with pious mind, We have offered this work for the benefit of man.
(13) We have considered it necessary to bring this decree to the notice of all
men, in order that they may learn out of what vast confusion and prolixity the
laws have been brought within reasonable bounds, and the truth established; and
that they may hereafter have laws which are as similar as compact, and placed
within the reach of all; so that men may be able to easily obtain possession of
the books containing them, and will not be overwhelmed with expense in the
acquisition of a multitude of volumes of superfluous enactments; but that they
may be secured with but trifling expense by the rich as well as by the poor,
and an immense fund of legal information be rendered available by the
expenditure of a very small sum of money.
(14) If, however, in so extensive a collection of laws compiled from an
enormous number of volumes, some repetitions may, perhaps, be encountered, no
one will be justified in thinking that this work should be blamed, but this
defect ought in the first place to be attributed to the weakness of human
nature, which is but natural; for to possess a memory of all things and to err
in nothing is rather an attribute of divinity, than of mortality, as has also
been stated by our ancestors; and then it should be remembered that, in certain
cases, and these very rarely occurring, repetition is not useless and contrary
to Our design. For either it was necessary for the law to be formulated under
the different titles to which it is applicable on account of the connection of
various matters; or, where it had been mingled with other subjects, it was
impossible to divide it into different parts to avoid producing confusion
throughout the whole; and in those places in which the ideas of the ancients
were most perfectly set forth, it would have been improper to divide and
classify what had been scattered among them indiscriminately, otherwise, the
understanding as well as the ears of those who read them would be disturbed.
In like manner, where anything was provided by the Imperial Constitutions this
We have not, under any circumstances, permitted to be included in the Digest,
as it is sufficient for it to be laid down in the Constitutions, except, very
rarely, in cases in which repetition was allowed.
(15) Nothing which is contradictory can claim a place for itself, or be found
in this Code; for if anyone should, with careful reflection, seek out the
reason for a seeming discrepancy, while doing so something new will be found,
or a clause with a hidden meaning will dispose of the complaint of
contradiction, and put an end to the apparent discord.
(16) If, however, anything should have been omitted, which was, as it were,
concealed in the depths of so many volumes, and, while it
was proper to be inserted, was necessarily abandoned on account of its being
involved in obscurity, anyone who is actuated by just principles can understand
that this has occurred on account of the weakness of the human mind, and also
because of the defects of the matter itself, which, mingled with many useless
matters, offered no opportunity for its extraction from them; and finally, for
the reason that it is much more advantageous to omit a few things which are
valuable than to overwhelm mankind with a vast number which are worthless.
(17) One remarkable fact, however, is disclosed by the perusal of these books,
that is to say, the multitude of ancient laws is found to contain less than the
present abridgment, for although many had already been enacted, still, persons
who formerly engaged in litigation availed themselves of only a very few of
these; either because it was impossible to procure them on account of the
scarcity of books, or by reason of the ignorance of the parties litigant
themselves; and hence actions were disposed of rather according to the
arbitrary will of the judges, than by the authority of the laws. In the present
compilation of Our Digest, however, the collection of legal enactments has been
made from a great number of volumes the names of which We assert not only that
the ancients were not acquainted with, but had not even heard of; and all of
these have been assembled, and their substance thoroughly condensed, so that
the multitude possessed by the ancients is found to be poor, and in comparison
with it, our abridgment appears most opulent.
That most illustrious man, Tribonian, obtained a vast number of books
containing the legal wisdom of former times, among which there were many
unknown to even men most learned in the law; all of which having been carefully
read, whatever they contained which was best was extracted, and inserted into
Our excellent compilation. Those who were engaged in this work not only read
over the volumes from which the laws were extracted, but also many others in
which they found nothing either useful or new, and which, with excellent
judgment, they rejected as not being entitled to a place in Our Digest.
(18) For the reason that only divine things are perfect, and that the course of
human legislation has always a tendency to extend to infinity, and there is
nothing in it which can endure for all time, for Nature herself hastens to
bring forth many new forms, We think that matters may subsequently arise which
have not, as yet, been provided for by Our laws. Therefore, if anything of this
kind should happen, recourse must be had to the Emperor for a remedy, since God
has placed his Imperial fortune above all human affairs, so that he can correct
and arrange all new cases which may arise, and establish them by proper rules
and regulations. This principle was not first promulgated by Us, but has
descended from Our ancient race; for Julianus himself, the most wise author of
laws and the Perpetual Edict, stated in his works that if anything should be
found imperfect in Roman jurisprudence, it should be supplied by an Imperial
Decree, and not stand alone without amendment; but the Divine Hadrian, also, in
framing the Edict (and the decree of the Senate has followed
it), stated most explicitly that if anything should take place which was not
referred to in the Edict, the Emperor had authority to decide it by his own
rules, opinions, and comparisons.
(19) For these reasons You, Conscript Fathers, familiar with all these matters,
and all the men of the earth, should offer the fullest acknowledgments to the
Supreme Divinity, who has reserved so salutary a work for your times, as Divine
Power has conferred upon you that which antiquity was not deemed by it worthy
to receive. Therefore respect and obey these laws, without reference to such as
are most ancient, and let none of you venture to compare them with former ones,
or attempt to discover anything which may be conflicting in either, because We
decree that all which has been inserted in Our collection shall alone be
observed. And let nothing else either be cited, or produced, either in court or
in any contest where laws are necessary, from any other books than these Our
Institutes, Digest, and Constitutions composed and promulgated by Us, unless
the rash person who does so desires to be rendered liable for the crime of
forgery, and to suffer the severest penalties, together with any judge who
suffers him to be heard.
(20) In order that you may not be ignorant from what books of the ancients this
compilation has been made, We have ordered this to be inserted in the first
part of Our Digest, in order that it may be perfectly clear by what legal
authorities, and from what works of theirs, many thousands in number, this
fabric of Roman jurisprudence has been constructed.
Moreover, We have chosen those legislators and commentators whose opinions were
worthy of insertion in such an important compendium, and whom the most pious
Emperors, Our predecessors, have not considered undeserving of credit, and have
conferred upon them all the same weight, without according to any the right to
claim the preference; for, as We have decreed that these laws shall take the
place of constitutions, just as if they had been promulgated by Us, how could
any greater or less authority be bestowed upon them, as the same dignity and
power is conceded to all?
(21) It appears to Us to be timely to repeat here what We decreed in the first
place, when, with the assistance of God, We ordered this work to be undertaken,
namely that no one of those who is at present learned in the law, nor any
person who may hereafter be born, shall presume to add any commentaries to
these laws, unless .someone may desire to translate them into the Greek
language, in the same order, and with the same arrangement in which they appear
in the Roman idiom, which the Greeks call "Foot to foot" (Katapo/ta) and if
they should desire to make any notes on titles, or to compose abridgments
called para-titles, We do not grant them permission to make any other
interpretations to the laws which are, in fact, perversions of the same; lest
their verbosity may bring dishonor upon Our laws, on account of the confusion
which may arise, as was caused by the ancient commentators on the Perpetual
Edict, a work well drawn up, but which they extended immensely by distributing
their
conflicting opinions here and there throughout the text, so that almost all
Roman jurisprudence remains in a chaotic condition.
If we have not been able to endure these discrepancies, how can the frivolous
distinctions of those who come after Us be tolerated? They who may presume to
do anything of this kind shall be considered guilty of forgery, and their work
shall be entirely destroyed. If, however, anything should appear ambiguous, as
has been previously stated, it must be referred by the judge to the decision of
the sovereign, and it shall be explained by the Imperial Authority to whom
alone has been granted the right to enact and interpret legislation.
(22) We have decided that the same penalty for forgery shall be inflicted upon
those who hereafter shall dare to disfigure, or obscure our laws by means of
abbreviations; for We desire that everything contained in them, that is to say,
the names of the jurists, and the titles and numbers of the books, shall all
fully be written out in letters, and not designated by abbreviations; and
whoever prepares a work of this kind for himself, and inserts any such
abbreviations in any part of the book or volume, is hereby notified that he is
the owner of a worthless code, for We do not give permission for any citations
to be made in court from one which contains in any part the defect of
abbreviations. Any copyist who dares to transcribe these things shall not only
be punished with a criminal penalty, as has been previously stated, but shall
be compelled to restore to the owner double the value of the book, whether the
owner himself ignorantly purchased it, or caused it to be made; which
contingency has already been provided for and published by Us in a Latin and a
Greek Constitution addressed to professors of law.
(23) Moreover, We order that the laws which We have collected in the above-
mentioned Codes, that is to say, the Institutes or Elements, and the Digest or
Pandects, shall obtain their authority from the date of Our Third most happy
Consulate of the present twelfth indiction, the third of the Kalendsof January;
and shall be valid for all time, having the same force as Our Constitutions and
exerting their authority in all cases in court, whether these may hereafter be
brought, whether they are at present pending, or whether they are under the
jurisdiction of the tribunal itself or have been submitted for arbitration; and
as for those which have already been terminated by a judicial decision, or
settled by amicable agreement, We decree that they shall, under no
circumstances, be revived.
We have hastened to promulgate these laws during our Third Consulate, which We
consider propitious for the reason that the most blessed aid of God and of our
Lord Jesus Christ bestowed it upon the State, at the time when the Parthian War
was terminated and followed by a lasting peace, and the third part of the world
subjected to Our authority. For, in addition to Europe, Asia and all Lybia were
then added to Our dominions, and this important legal work having been
concluded, all the favors of Heaven were thus conferred upon Our Third
Consulate.
(24) Therefore, all our judges shall receive these laws according to their
jurisdiction, and shall cause them to be observed not only in their tribunals,
but also in this Imperial capital, and the illustrious Prefect of this Fair
City is hereby especially charged with their execution; and, moreover, the
three eminent Praetorian Prefects of the East, of Illyria, and of Lybia, shall
be careful to have them published and brought to the knowledge of all those
subject to their jurisdiction.
Given on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof January, during the third Consulate
of our Lord Justinian, 533.
CONCERNING THE CONFIRMATION OF THE DIGEST. In the name of Our Lord God Jesus
Christ.
4. The Emperor Caesar-Flavius-Justinianus, Alamanicus, Gothicus, Francicus,
Germanicus, Anticus, Alanicus, Vandalicus, Africanus, pious, fortunate,
illustrious, victor and triumpher, always to be revered, and Augustus; to the
great Senate and the people in all the cities of Our Empire.
After having made peace with the Persians, and obtained trophies from the
Vandals, with the acquisition of all Lybia, and having, for a second time,
united the renowned City of Carthage to our Empire, God gave Us the opportunity
to bring to its desired end the work of the revision of the ancient laws, an
undertaking which no Emperor before Our age thought was possible either to be
planned or executed by human genius. For it was a most extraordinary thing for
all the Roman jurisprudence, from the foundation of the ancient city to the
date of Our reign, a period of almost thirteen hundred years, which, in its
various parts, was sometimes in agreement with and sometimes in opposition to
the Imperial decrees, not only to have removed from it whatever was
contradictory, but also to have suppressed whatever was found to be identical
or similar, and thus to afford a varied idea of the beauty of the law itself,
so that every enactment might seem to have been passed to meet the exigencies
of each individual case. This was undoubtedly due to the superior divinity and
benignity of God, and not attributable to the exertion of human thought or
power.
Therefore We, in accordance with Our custom, having raised our hands to God,
and besought Him that he would consider Us worthy of his assistance, began the
undertaking, and have at last completed it, through the agency of Tribonian,
that most illustrious Master, and Ex-Quaestor of Our Sacred Palace, and Ex-
Consul, as well as by the efforts of certain other eminent and learned men; and
having diligently examined everything compiled by them, and carefully explained
whatever was ambiguous, We have given to all the laws a suitable form,
according to the knowledge and strength of intellect which has been bestowed
upon Us by Our God and Our Saviour Jesus Christ.
(1) Therefore, We have inserted in the Code under Our name the Constitutions of
the Emperors, formerly included in twelve books, and have collected in a single
abridged and clear compendium all the opinions of the ancient founders of the
law which are contained in
almost two thousand volumes, and three millions of paragraphs, and, with the
favor of Heaven, divided all these into fifty books, after having collected
everything useful, and rejected everything ambiguous, without leaving anything
contradictory. These books We designated the Digest or Pandects, for the reason
that they contain divisions and decisions of the laws, and also because they
have all the science of jurisprudence epitomized in them We have given them
this appellation. They do not include more than a hundred and fifty thousand
paragraphs, and We have divided them into seven treatises, which was not done
improperly or unreasonably, but with reference to the nature and harmony of the
number seven.
(2) Hence, We have divided into four books those things which are generally
styled prota,or the first principles of the science.
(3) Next We have divided into another seven books those matters which treat of
judgments.
(4) Likewise the part which treats of things only includes eight books.
(5) The following part of the work, which is the fourth and central one of all,
We have divided into eight more books, in which the hypothecary action, which
does not differ greatly from that on pledge, and the Edict of the Ædiles and
the stipulation having reference to evictions are discussed, which two
treatises are accessory to, and dependent upon sales; and although in the
arrangement of the ancient laws they were widely separated, We have brought
them together on account of their common relationship, and in order that what
has reference to the same subject may not be far apart.
After these two books, We have introduced whatever has been written with
reference to interest, to loans on land as well as on sea; and what relates to
evidence and presumptions We have combined in a single book; and in each of
these three matters closely connected with the treatise on things are
discussed.
This having been done, We took up those laws which have reference to
betrothals, marriages, and dowries, and to these subjects We have devoted three
volumes in the order above stated. The two books which have reference to
guardians of minors  I mean those which are ordinarily designated "On
Guardianship"  We have included in an abridgment, and have completed the
above-mentioned arrangement of eight books, and the central part of the entire
work (as has already been stated), having inserted therein the most admirable
and useful of all the laws.
(6) We have condensed everything relating to testaments, legacies, and trusts
into nine books, at the beginning of which are placed those which relate to
wills and codicils, not only of all civilians but also of soldiers who desire
to make testamentary disposition of their estates, and these compose two books
entitled "Concerning Wills."
The five following books contain matters which pertain to legacies and trusts,
and everything which has been laid down with reference to their ambiguity; and
as the explanation of the Falcidian Law is connected with, and dependent upon
legacies and trusts, We have
discussed it in its proper place, and have inserted it next to the treatise on
legacies in asingle book on the subject, with some brief additions.
Again, for the reason that the Trebellian Decree of the Senate has been
introduced into trusts in the same way as the Falcidian Law, We have placed all
that has been decided on this subject under the Trebellian Decree of the
Senate; considering that it is superfluous to give space to the Pegasian Decree
of the Senate, and that the differences and agreements which have been
established between these Decrees of the Senate are absurd, which, indeed, the
ancients detested and called captious and wrongful. Having combined all these
matters in a more simple form, and placed them under the head of the Trebellian
Decree of the Senate, We perfected this Fifth Part of the entire arrangement in
nine books. In these nine books, however, nothing has been said by Us with
reference to estates which have no owners, and which were liable to
confiscation, because this practice was only introduced during a period of
public misfortune, and was a mournful monument of the Civil War; and it was not
proper for it to continue to exist in these times, during which God gave Us
peace at home and abroad, and when it was necessary to carry on war, enabled Us
with His favor to prevail over, and conquer Our enemies.
(7) Next follows and appears the Sixth Part of Our entire compilation, included
in eight books. These very properly begin with matters which treat of
possession under the praetorian law, and, having examined them carefully in the
same way as the others, We have classified not only those which have reference
to freeborn persons, but also such as concern freedmen, rendering clear what in
former times was doubtful, on account of its confusion and obscurity, being of
the opinion that two books were sufficient for this purpose. We have also
treated, in the same books, intestate successions, and the order of descent,
inserting in one of them the different degrees of relationship, and at the end
We have placed the Tertullian and Orphitian Decrees of the Senate, by which
mothers and their children succeed to the estates of one another.
Next in order after these topics comes another book relating to the
construction of buildings, and of security furnished on account of houses which
have become ruinous, and threaten to fall; and concerning persons who have been
guilty of deceit or fraud in cases of this kind, as well as those who injure
their neighbors by the flow of water; which book also treats of collectors of
the public revenues, and donations, both indefinite and simple, and as such
being made in consideration of death, the laws provide for.
Again, whatever has reference to manumissions of every description and the
actions brought on account of them are included in a single book. Further, all
questions relating to possession, and the different grounds for obtaining it,
We have inserted in a single treatise, or book. Moreover, everything pertaining
to judicial decisions, and persons who have confessed anything against
themselves in court, as well as matters having reference to assignments for the
benefit of creditors, the detention of debtors, the sale, separation, and care
of property, and measures to prevent the defrauding of creditors, are likewise
collected in a single book.
We have only devoted one book to interdicts; and next, We come to prescriptions
or exceptions, and the times prescribed for their operation. We then discuss
the various kinds of obligations and legal procedure, and We have arranged the
contents of this Part, which begins with praetorian possessions (as has already
been stated), in eight books, constituting the Sixth Part of the entire work.
(8) The last Part of all, which is the Seventh, is composed of six books,
beginning with stipulations, and then proceeding to the rules which have been
laid down with reference to suretyship, the liability of debtors, payment by
them, and their discharge; and also concerning agreements introduced by the
authority of the Praetors; all of which has been condensed by Us into two books,
which could not be said of those of the ancients, as there was an enormous
number of them.
We next proceed to the description of crimes, and discuss whatever pertains to
minor offences which are called private, as well as to such as are styled
extraordinary; but this appellation, "extraordinary," also applies to public
crimes which are most atrocious in their character, and demand exemplary
punishment. Moreover, in the two books which include matters relating to
offences and crimes are inserted those regulations which have been prescribed
with reference to offenders against the law who attempt to conceal themselves,
as well as respecting their property, and the penalty which should be inflicted
upon them, or the pardon which they may be able to obtain.
In the beginning of the next book, appeals are discussed, a proceeding to which
recourse is very frequently had for the annulling of pecuniary or civil
decisions, as well as criminal ones. Again, whatever was provided by the
ancient jurists with reference to citizens, municipal magistrates, decurions,
offices and public works, markets, and promises of revenues and various
judicial proceedings or examinations, the enumeration of citizens, the
signification of terms, and the rules laid down by the ancients, are all
contained in the last book. This one is the sixth of the compilation, beginning
with stipulations, if reference is had to the beginning of that portion, but it
is the fiftieth where the entire perfection or harmony of the compilation is
considered.
(9) All these things have been compiled and elaborated in the very best manner
possible, and as it was proper that it should be done in accordance with Our
order, by the illustrious Tribonian, that most wise Master, Ex-Quaestor of Our
Palace, and Ex-Consul, a man of experience in affairs, highly regarded for his
eloquence, and well versed in the laws, and who has not disobeyed any of Our
commands. He has also been assisted by others who have contributed their
services to Us in this undertaking; namely, Constantine, the eminent Count of
the Sacred Largesses, Master of Requests and Secretary of State, who in every
respect has given Us a favorable opinion of himself; and Theophilus, the
eminent master who, in a most praiseworthy manner,
imparts legal instruction in this Imperial City with the greatest zeal and
assiduity of which the occupation is worthy; and Dorotheus, the distinguished
Quaestor, appointed Doctor of Laws in the city, by which We mean the venerated
and splendid metropolis of Berytus, which itself has given him to Us on account
of his high reputation and eminence, and has besought Us to make him a
participant in this work; along with Anatolius, the most accomplished master,
who himself, at Berytus, teaches in an elegant manner everything relating to
the law, a man of the third generation of scholars renowned among the
Phoenicians as interpreters of jurisprudence (for he traces his lineage to
Leontius and Eudoxius, men of the most distinguished reputation, after
Patricius, of illustrious memory, who held the offices of Quaestor and first
Censor, and Leontius, the famous Ex-Prefect and Ex-Consul, as well as
Patricious, his son, all of whom are worthy of the greatest admiration); and
Cratinus, the eminent and learned Count of the Sacred Largesses, distinguished
lecturer on the law in this Imperial City; and in addition to these, Stephen,
Mena, Prosdocius, Eutolmius, Timotheus, Leonidas, Leontius, Plato, James,
Constantine, and John; all men thoroughly versed in jurisprudence, advisers of
Our Prefects in Our praetorian prefectures, and who have justly attained a high
reputation for legal knowledge among all men, have been decided by Us to be
worthy of being chosen as participants in an undertaking of this importance.
Therefore, the compilation of the Digest has been made for Us by these most
distinguished jurists.
(10) We have such respect for antiquity that We have not permitted the names of
the ancient legislators to be omitted, but have inserted that of each one in
the laws, changing, however, in the latter what did not seem to be correct;
removing some portions, and adding others; selecting what was best from many of
them, and giving equal force and power to all; so that whatever is laid down in
this book may appear to be Our own opinion; and let no one dare to compare
those things which are included in this work with what formerly appeared in
others, because We have changed for the better many things which it would not
be easy to enumerate; even if anything in one of the constitutions of preceding
Emperors should have been expressed in different language, for, although We
have preserved their names, We have assumed the right to establish the truth of
their laws, and therefore, whenever anything contradictory existed in them
(and, indeed, there was a great deal), it has been suppressed, and every law
has been clearly stated and brought to a definite conclusion.
(11) As, however, it was necessary to make a short abridgment for the benefit
of those beginning the study of the law, who could not understand the higher
branches of the science, We did not neglect this duty, and therefore, We
directed the most eminent Tribonian, who was chosen for the supervision of this
entire work, to be summoned with Theophilus and Dorotheus, most eminent and
learned professors of the law, that they might select from the treatises
composed by the ancients, all matters which were best adapted for the purpose,
and of the most important in studies of this kind, so that they might collect
them and offer them to Us, and mention Our Constitutions, which We promulgated
for the improvement of the ancient law, and compile four books containing the
first elements of legal science, which We have considered proper to designate
as "Institutes." This compilation having been made, they presented it to Us,
and We have carefully examined and weighed it, and have decided that it was not
unworthy of Our design, and have ordered that it shall have all the force of
Our Constitutions, and be considered as taking their place, which We have made
clear to all from the introduction that we have prefixed to the said volume.
(12) Therefore the entire substance of the Roman law having been thus compiled
in three parts, in an equal number of years (which, in the beginning, We
considered to be beyond all hope of completion in ten years), but now, having
been finished with such speed in three years, with the assistance of God, who
has afforded Us the opportunity to make peace, and bring Our wars to a happy
termination, and establish laws for the past, present and future, We have
thought it to be proper to bring to the attention of all persons the zeal and
wisdom which We have displayed in this undertaking. In this way it will become
apparent how jurisprudence was rescued from the disorder and confusion in which
it formerly existed, without the prospect of any end to this condition; and men
will hereafter be able to make use of laws which are just, comprehensive, and
present ready for the hands of all; a compendium admirably adapted to the
purposes of litigation and easily to be acquired by those who may desire; so
that there will be no longer need for larger sums of money to collect a vast
number of worthless books, but, with the expenditure of a very small sum, not
only the rich but also those in moderate circumstances will have an opportunity
to purchase this work.
(13) If, indeed, out of the multitude of the subjects which have now been
brought together and collected from so many thousands of volumes, any which are
similar or identical should appear (which, however, We think can rarely occur),
although, considering the weakness of human nature, this will not seem to be
inexcusable; for to make no mistake, or to be irreprehensible, or unerring in
every respect, is an attribute of God alone, and not one of mortal constancy or
power, as has already been stated by the ancients. Where, then, We have assumed
a similar position, or the exigency of the case required that the same thing
should be repeated under different titles, or one subject should be mixed with
another which had already been explained, it has been impossible to dispose of
this resemblance, either because the continuity of the entire text had to be
preserved, or to avoid distracting the attention of the reader by the removal
of what already had been written; and if sometimes the necessity of the case
required this to be done, still it was effected in a few words, and has but
little significance.
(14) We have also observed this with reference to the Imperial Constitutions
and the laws dependent upon the same; for whatever was provided in them We did
not permit to be inserted in this collec-
tion, except where, on account of some circumstance, the point demanded
repetition.
(15) No one will easily find among matters included in this compilation any
conflicting laws, provided he directs his attention to the scrutiny of all the
appearances of contradiction; but some distinctions do exist, which, however,
when examined, clearly show that an apparent discrepancy in one place often, in
reality, has reference to something entirely different in another.
(16) If, indeed, anything which should be inserted has been omitted (and this
might readily happen on account of the weakness of human nature), it will be
much better for Our subjects to be freed from a multitude of worthless laws,
even though they may be deprived of some few which appear to be useful, but
which are buried and deposited in thousands of volumes, and probably would not
have been noticed by any human being.
(17) For this reason, judges not having access to so many books (which it was
formerly necessary to have copied), terminated actions too readily by making
use of very few legal authorities, and rendered decisions in this manner either
on account of their lack of works on jurisprudence, or because their strength
was not sufficient to undergo the labor required for making such researches as
were necessary to ascertain the numerous points which were useful. In the
present compilation, however, a very large number of the laws in force have
been collected from books which are extremely rare, and can hardly be obtained,
and with whose very names many men most learned in the law are unacquainted.
The materials for this, the above-mentioned illustrious Tribonian has furnished
Us by providing an almost incalculable number of volumes, all of which, after
being carefully read, have been assembled; and when those jurists who were
called together by Us for this purpose encountered nothing either applicable or
new in many different ones which had been collected, they, with excellent
judgment, rejected any citations from them in the compilation of this work.
(18) Where, however, anything new subsequently arises, which becomes a subject
of controversy, and does not appear to be determined by these laws (for Nature
knows how to make many innovations), God has conferred imperial power upon man
in order that it may settle questions which may come up, and dispose of defects
in the law, and has prescribed certain rules and regulations for the purpose of
explaining what is ambiguous in human nature. We do not now claim credit for
this, as Julianus, the most learned of all the founders of the law who were
formerly eminent for their wisdom, is alleged to have said the same thing, and
to have had recourse to the imperial authority to supply the legal deficiencies
existing in the case of pressing and doubtful questions; and the Divine Hadrian
of pious memory, also, included in a small volume all the Edicts promulgated by
the Praetors, and for many years employed the great Julianus for that purpose,
having stated in a public address, which he made in ancient Rome, that if any
point should arise which had not already been de-
termined, it was proper for those who belong to the magistracy to attempt to
decide it, and to find a remedy in accordance with the judgments previously
rendered in cases of the same kind.
(19) Therefore, You being aware of all these things (for We are addressing You,
the Great Senate, and all the subjects of Our Empire), should acknowledge your
gratitude to God, who has preserved such a benefit for Our reign, and avail
yourselves of Our laws without paying attention to any of those included in the
ancient treatises, or making any comparison of them with those which form part
of Our compilation; because if some of them should appear not to agree with one
another, still you cannot fail to be aware that what was ancient has been
discarded by Us as imperfect, and that Our present work must now be held to
possess authority; for We forbid the works of the ancients to be used
hereafter.
We, moreover, permit and decree that only the laws of this Our compilation
shall be observed, and have authority in the State; so that anyone who attempts
to make citations in court from the ancient treatises, and not from these two
alone, and the book of Constitutions, compiled or drawn up by Us, or who has
recourse to any other enactments, and any judge who allows them to be cited in
his presence, shall be considered as guilty of forgery, and sentenced as a
public criminal, and shall undergo the penalty prescribed for the same, which
is manifest from the fact itself, even if We had not stated it.
(20) We have decided that it would be best to prefix to the Digest not only the
names of the ancient founders of the law, but also the title of their works,
from whence the body of laws now compiled by Us has been derived; and this We
have ordered to be done. We have also, at the same time, directed that whatever
has been drawn up with reference to these matters shall be added to this Our
Divine Constitutions, in order that what was insufficient and uncertain in
former times, and what has been contributed by Us, may be clear to all. We have
also collected the treatises of those legislators or interpreters of the law
which were approved and accepted by all persons, enjoyed the favor of former
Emperors, and deserved to be quoted by them. When, however, any work was not
known to the ancient legislators, We have forbidden it to be included in this
compilation. We have conceded equal authority to all the treatises which We
have made use of, without giving a greater preference to one than to the
others; for if we have given the force of Imperial Constitutions to everything
which has been written by all of them, why is it that anything contained
therein should be entitled to more or less consideration than something else?
(21) We now repeat the order which We issued at the time when we ordered this
compilation of the laws to be made; and We, a second time, sanction it by
confirming it, and forbid all persons who are now in existence, or may
hereafter exist, to compose any commentaries on these laws, except where
someone desires to translate them into the Greek language, which We command to
be done literally, or what is styled "foot by foot;" and if he should wish to
avail himself of para-
titles (as a matter of convenience), he can do so; but he shall not make any
other alterations, no matter how trifling they may be, nor give occasion for
contradictions, ambiguities, or infinite repetitions of laws to arise, which
formerly occurred during the arrangement of the ancient Edict, so that this
work, which was originally extremely short, through the differences and
discrepancies of the various commentaries, was protracted to an infinite
length. For if anything in Our compilation should appear ambiguous, either to
the parties litigant, or to the magistrates having jurisdiction, it must be
decided by the Emperor, for this privilege is granted by the laws to him alone.
Therefore, if anyone should dare to add any commentary to this Our compilation
of laws, or should state anything in opposition to the form of this Our Decree,
he is hereby notified that he will be liable to punishment for forgery, and
that what he has written shall be taken from him and absolutely destroyed.
(22) The same penalty shall be imposed upon those who make use of any
abbreviations or notes, in copying the laws (which abbreviations are called
singulae),and to attempt to confuse the text; as well as upon those who do not
write out in full, and in letters, the numbers and names of the ancient
jurists, as well as all their laws. Let the purchasers of books of this kind
also know that they are the owners of works of no value, for We do not consent
that they shall quote such books in court, or employ them in any way, even if
what is cited has reference to a part of the volume in which there is no such
abbreviation or mark, or where no such abbreviation is found in any other part
of the same, except the one from which the citation is taken. Hence the owner
must consider the book as not having been written at all; and he who wrote it
and delivered it to the ignorant purchaser shall pay double the amount of the
damage sustained by him, and shall also be liable to a criminal penalty. We
have already stated this in other constitutions, not only in those which have
been promulgated in Latin, but also in others published in the Greek language,
which We have addressed to professors of law.
(23) Therefore We order that these volumes (We refer to the Institutes and the
Digest), shall have authority from the end of Our third most fortunate
Consulate, that is to say from before the third of the Kalendsof January of the
present twelfth indiction; and shall be valid for all time, and have the same
force and effect as the Imperial Constitutions, not only in cases which may
hereafter arise, but also in those which are now pending in court, and which
have not yet been amicably settled; for We do not permit any case which has
been determined or settled to be revived.
God has, indeed, favored Us in this third most famous consulate, as, during it,
peace has been concluded with the Persians; and this great work on the laws,
which never was even imagined by any of Our predecessors, has been completed;
and a third part of the world (We refer to all of Lybia), has been added to Our
dominions, for all these benefits have been granted Us during Our third
Consulate, by the grace of God and Our Saviour Jesus Christ.
(24) Therefore, all the worthy magistrates of Our Empire having received this,
Our Divine Constitution must make use of Our aforesaid laws, each one in his
own jurisdiction. The illustrious Praetorian Prefect of this Imperial City shall
publish it, and Our most eminent and worthy Master of the Palace, and the
renowned and fortunate Prefects of our Sacred Prefectures, not only of the
Orient, but also those who have jurisdiction over Illyria and Lybia, must
provide by their Edicts that these things shall be brought to the knowledge of
those under their authority, so that none of all Our subjects can allege want
of notice as an excuse.
Given on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof January, during the third Consulate
of our Lord Justinian, ever Augustus, 533.
TITLE XVIII. CONCERNING IGNORANCE OF LAW AND OF FACT.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to the Soldier Maximus.
Although when you were conducting your case you may have omitted to make use of
proper allegations through ignorance of the law, or because of your want of
information as a soldier; still, if you have not yet satisfied the claim, I
will permit you to avail yourself of all your means of defence, if proceedings
have been begun to enforce
the judgment.
Given on the seventh of the Kalendsof May, under the Consulate
of Asper, 213.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Juvenal.
You cannot readily be excused on account of your ignorance of the law, if,
after having passed the age of twenty-five years, you rejected the estate of
your mother; for your application for relief will be too late.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate
of Arian and Papus, 244.
3. The Emperor Philip to Marcella.
If, after having been emancipated by your father, you neglected to claim
possession of his estate within a year from the time of his death, you can,
under no circumstances, allege ignorance of the law.
Given on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of
Peregrinus and Æmilianus, 245.
4. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Julian.
If, after an estate has been divided, a defect should be discovered in the
will, you will not be prejudiced by anything which has been done through
ignorance. Therefore inform Our illustrious friend, the Governor, that the will
is forged, or cannot stand under the law, so that the document which was
produced as a will having been annulled, you may obtain the entire estate.
Given on the eighth of the Idesof July, during the Consulate of Diocletian and
Maximian, 293.
5. The Same, and Constantius and Maximian, Caesars, to Martial.
As the substance of the truth can, under no circumstances, be changed by false
statements, you have done nothing by merely alleging that what really belonged
to your father's estate formed part of that of your mother.
Given on the day before the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Diocletian, Consul for the fifth time, and Maximian, Consul for the fourth
time, 293.
6. The Same and the Caesars to Taurus and Pollio.
Where, as the result not of a business transaction, but through an error of
fact, you have promised in a stipulation a certain amount of oil, which was not
due, to Archonticus, and the Governor of the province is informed of your
promise, after you have delivered what you owe, he shall hear you, if you
demand to be released from delivery of the remainder.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof May, 294.
7. The Same Emperors and Caesars to Zoa.
An error of fact, so long as the business is not terminated, prejudices no one;
but where a case has been decided, it cannot be reopened under a pretext of
this kind.
Given on the sixth of the Nonesof July, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Caesars.
8. The Same and the Caesars to Dionysia.
When a testament is declared to be void, slaves who would have become free
under it, if it had been valid, will not obtain their liberty by the mere
statement of the heir at law, who erroneously referred to them as the freedmen
of the testator, or his own freedmen; as the will of a person who is mistaken
is of no effect.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof September, during the fourth Consulate of
the above-mentioned Caesars, 302.
9. The Same and the Caesars to Gaius and Anthemius.
Although Sanius is said to have received a sum of money from you, as due from
persons who are free, his heirs are not forbidden to raise the question of your
status, as no one who is mistaken is considered to give his consent.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof December, during the fifth Consulate of the
above-mentioned Caesars, 305.
10. The Same and the Caesars to Araphia.
Where anyone, who is ignorant of the law, pays money which is not due, he
cannot recover it; for you are well aware that only ignorance of fact confers
the right to recover money which has been paid when it was not due.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof January, during the sixth Consulate of the
above-mentioned Caesars, 306.
11. The Emperor Constantine to Valerian, Deputy.
Although it is not customary for relief to be granted to women who are ignorant
of the law, in matters where they have been benefited, still, the constitutions
of former Emperors stated that this rule does not apply to females who are
minors.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Gallicanus and
Symmachus, 330.
12. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Flavian, Praetorian
Prefect.
We do not permit anyone to be, or pretend to be, ignorant of the Imperial
Constitutions.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Tatianus and
Symmachus, 391.
13. The Emperors Leo and Anthemius to Erythrius, Praetorian Prefect.
In order that women may not be permitted indiscriminately to violate their
contracts, in which they have omitted or ignored certain things, We decree that
if they suffer any damage in their rights or property through their ignorance,
relief shall be granted them only in cases where the authority of former laws
favors them.
Given on the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Martianus and Zeno, 469.
TITLE XIX.
CONCERNING THE PRESENTATION OF PETITIONS TO THE
EMPEROR, AND WHAT THINGS MAY BE ASKED FOR AND
WHAT MAY NOT.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Firmena.
Although a person in a servile condition is not generally considered capable of
presenting a petition, still the atrocity of the crime which has been
committed, and the praiseworthy example of fidelity which you have exhibited
for the purpose of avenging the murder of your master, has prevailed upon Us to
order the Praetorian Prefect, to whom you must apply, to make search for the
culprits and see that the severest vengeance authorized by the law is
inflicted, after those matters which you have inserted in your petition have
been heard.
Given on the eighth of the Idesof October, during the Consulate of Diocletian,
Consul for the sixth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third time, 296.
2. The Emperor Constantine to Severus, Prefect of the City.Whenever a dilatory
exception is permitted by Our Rescript, access to Us shall be granted the
petitioner; but an exception which
puts an end to the entire affair, or exhausts its force, cannot be authorized
without causing great loss to the other party; and therefore the relief of a
peremptory exception shall not be applied for.
Given on the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Paulinus and Julian.
3. The Same to the People.
Nothing which is injurious to the Treasury, or contrary to law, can be the
subject of a petition.
Given on the day before the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of
Constantine, Consul for the seventh time, and Constantine-Caesar, Consul for the
fourth time, 354.
4. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Florian, Praetorian
Prefect.
All rescripts which have been promulgated for the purpose of granting delay in
the case of debtors shall not be valid, unless security sufficient for the
payment of the indebtedness is furnished.
Given at Constantinople, on the eighth of the Kalendsof March, during the
Consulate of Antony and Syagrius, 382.
5. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Volusianus, Praetorian Prefect.
When anyone has presented a petition against the decisions of the Praetorian
Prefect, and has failed to have it received, he shall not have permission to
again present a petition for the same purpose.
Given at Rome, on the fifth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of
Valentinian and Valens, 365.
Extract from Novel 119, Chapter V. Latin Text.
The petition shall be presented to the eminent Prefects or their councilors, or
to the Masters of Requests, within ten days after judgment has been rendered.
This having been done, execution shall not be ordered, unless the successful
party furnishes sufficient security for the restoration of the property with
its lawful increase, as has been set forth in the judgment, where the decision,
for just cause, may be set aside. Unless a petition is presented with these
formalities, the execution of the judgment shall proceed without any security,
and the right of the party who considers himself aggrieved to again petition
shall be preserved, so that he can apply to the Emperor within the term of two
years.
6. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Isidor, Praetorian Prefect.
We grant as a privilege to all persons, without distinction, that, where a
constitution has been obtained by anyone who is free, or a rescript has been
issued to a slave upon his petition, no inquiry shall be made to ascertain by
whom the request was made.
Given on the third of the Idesof November, during the Consulate of Theodosius,
Consul for the seventh time, and Palladius, 416.
7. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to the Senate.
We order that rescripts which have been obtained contrary to law shall be
rejected by all judges, unless they include something which may be of benefit
to the petitioner, and does not injure anyone else; or when they pardon the
crime of those making the request.
Given at Ravenna, on the eighth of the Idesof November, during the Consulate of
Theodosius, Consul for the twelfth time, and Valentinian, Consul for the second
time, 426.
8. The Same to Florentius, Praetorian Prefect.
It is of no advantage to attach copies of documents to petitions, but their
substance must be stated, so that the truth of the petition may explain the
facts to the Emperor, and he may be able to answer; and only where necessity
requires it should words be inserted in the petition of whose meaning the
parties are in doubt, to enable Us to render Our decision in accordance with
reason.
Given at Constantinople, on the sixth of the Kalendsof April, during the
Consulate of Florentius and Dionysius, 429.
TITLE XX.
WHEN A PETITION PRESENTED TO THE EMPEROR CAUSES A JOINDER OP ISSUE.
1. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Remigius, Praetorian Prefect.
There is no doubt that issue is understood to be joined in a case, even after a
petition has been presented to Us, and that it also affects the heir of him
against whom it was directed, as well as the heir of him who presented it.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Arcadius
and Honorius, Consuls for the fifth time, 396.
2. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Praetorian Prefect.
We have considered it necessary to define temporary actions which become
perpetual through the presentation of petitions, and rescripts issued on
account of them, in order that no one may think that this only applies to such
as are limited by time. Therefore, let all persons know that actions are
perpetuated only through the presentation of petitions and rescripts which are
issued concerning them, where they have been decided by the Praetor, and are
restricted to the term of one year.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof April, during the fifth Consulate of
Decius, 529.
TITLE XXI.
NO ONE HAS A RIGHT TO PRESENT A PETITION TO THE EMPEROR WHILE A CASE IS
PENDING, OR AFTER AN APPEAL HAS BEEN TAKEN, OR FINAL JUDGMENT HAS BEEN
RENDERED.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Caperius.
Although the illustrious Governor of the province may have rendered a decision
after you presented your petition, and before you obtained a rescript; still,
as you did not appeal from his decision, the rescript, which you say you have
subsequently obtained, will not have the effect of revoking what has been
decided by the decree.
Given on the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Lupus and Maximus, 233.
2. The Emperor Constantine to Probianus.
It is not allowed to present a petition while a case is pending, unless the
delivery of the documents, or the communication of the decree is refused.
Moreover, anyone, who attempts by the aid of a rescript or a consultation to
revive a question which has already been decided, shall immediately have
judgment rendered against him for all the costs of the case, in favor of his
adversary; and all indulgence shall be denied him, if, in violation of this
provision, he attempts to present a petition.
Given on the Idesof August, under the Consulate of Severus and Rufinus, 316.
3. The Same to All the People of the Provinces.
Anyone who fails to take an appeal which is proper must always remain silent,
and cannot impudently solicit Our aid by means of a petition; and if he should
do so, he will not only fail to obtain his wish, but he will be branded with
infamy.
Given on the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of Bassus and Ablavius,
331.
TITLE XXII.
WHERE ANYTHING CONTRARY TO LAW OR THE PUBLIC
WELFARE IS FRAUDULENTLY INCLUDED IN, OR OBTAINED
BY A PETITION.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian and the Caesars to Gregorius.
He, to whom jurisdiction has been granted by Our Rescript, must, none the less,
decide the case, even where you state that some matters relating to the
transaction have been omitted from the petition.
Given on the fifth of the Nonesof May, during the Consulate of Diocletian,
Consul for the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third time, 290.
2. The Same, and the Caesars, Constantine and Maximian, to
Statia.
An exception on the ground of falsehood may be filed where duplicity has been
detected in a statement of law or of fact, or where fraud has been committed by
remaining silent; and the judge who has been appointed must render his decision
in accordance with the truth, and not base it upon the allegations of the party
who opposes the exception.

Given on the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of Constantine, and
Licinius-Caesar, Consuls for the third time, 313.
4. The Same to Pompay.
When an exception is ordered, even if no judicial investigation has taken
place, it will be necessary to inquire with reference to the truth of the
allegations and petitions, so that, if fraud should exist, the judge may take
cognizance of the entire matter.
Given on the third of the Idesof November, during the Consulate of Dalmatius
and Zenophilus, 333.
5. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to the Senate.

the judge.

hesitate, under all circumstances, to observe the general Sacred Constitutions.

CONCERNING DIFFERENT RESCRIPTS AND PRAGMATIC SANCTIONS.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Superus.

both.
Given on the Idesof July, during the Consulate of Alexander, Consul for the
second time, and Marcellus, 227.
2. The Emperor Claudius to Epagathus.
It is falsely asserted that rescripts have no authority after a year has
elapsed, for whatever is stated in a rescript which has reference to the law
should be eternal; provided the time in which it must be produced or heard is
not limited.

Antiochianus and Orphitus, 271.

5. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Nicentius, Praetorian

Extract from Novel 114, Chapter I. Latin Text.The signature of our most
illustrious Quaestor is necessary, no matter what the contents of the rescript

sanction), shall be produced only under the condition that they conform to the
truth; nor shall a petitioner obtain any benefit from a rescript (even though
he proves the truth of his statements in court), unless the allegations that

pragmatic sanction shall be issued. The allegation of the truth of its contents
must also be inserted in the petition.

Consulate of Basilicus, Consul for the second time, and Armatius, 470.
TITLE XXIV. CONCERNING STATUES AND PICTURES.
1. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Theodore, Praetorian Prefect.
Where any judge is ascertained to have permitted a statue of brass, silver, or
marble to be erected to him during his term of office, without the permission
of the Emperor, he is hereby notified that he must pay into our Treasury a fine
of quadruple the amount of all the emoluments which he has received while in
the office which he has polluted with his extortions or insolence, and shall
also suffer the penalty of loss of reputation. For We do not wish those persons
to be immune from the risk of infamy who, with the desire of flattery, or
through the fear of being considered slothful, have attempted to perform acts
which are prohibited.
Given at Milan on the twelfth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Honorius, Consul for the fourth time, and Eutychianus, 398.
2. The Emperor Theodosius and the Caesar Valentinian, to Ætius, Praetorian
Prefect.
Whenever any statues are erected, or pictures are publicly placed in Our honor,
whether this is done on festival days (as is customary), or on ordinary days, a
judge shall be there, without, however, permitting the inappropriate ceremony
of adoration; so that by his presence he may honor the date and the place
consecrated to Our memory.
Given on the third of the Nonesof May, during the Consulate of Theodosius,
Consul for the eleventh time, and the Caesar Valentinian, 425.
3. The Same Emperor and Caesar to Florentius, Praetorian Prefect.
We order that when pictures or statues are to be erected or publicly placed in
Our honor, they shall not be taken from a private collection, in order to
prevent the collector of the same from claiming any one of them as. his own.
Given on the third of the Nonesof April, during the Consulate of Theodosius,
Consul for the seventeenth time, and Festus, 429.
4. The Same Emperor and Caesar to Nomus, Count, and Master of the Offices.
It is proper that the rewards of virtue should be bestowed upon deserving
persons, but it is not necessary that honors conferred upon some should result
in injury to others. Therefore, when a statue is erected to one of our judges,
or to anyone else, by some association or office, either in this most Holy City
or in one of the provinces, We do not permit the expenses of the same to be
collected from others, but order that the statues shall be erected at the
expense of the person in whose honor this was done.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Theodosius,
Consul for the eighteenth time, and Albinus, 444.

Prefect.
Where those who flee for refuge to the statues of the Emperor, either through
fear of others, or for the purpose of arousing hatred against them, if they
have good reason for doing so, they shall be judged according to equity, and
the laws; but, if they are proved to have intended by artifice to excite
animosity against their enemies, an avenging sentence should be pronounced
against them.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Nonesof July, during the
Consulate of Our Emperor Honorius, and of Evodius, 386.

sufficient ground for a joinder of issue.
Given on the day before the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of Agricola
and Clementinus, 231.
2. The Same to Restitulus.
The rules promulgated by the Praetorian Prefect, even though they may be general
in their character, must be observed, unless they contain something contrary to
the laws or the constitutions, if they have not subsequently been annulled by
My authority.
Given on the Idesof August, during the Consulate of Severus and Quintianus,
236.
3. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Titian, Praetorian
Prefect.
If Your Excellency should ascertain that any judges, on account of long-
continued illness, negligence, theft, or some other vice of this kind, should
not retain their office, after having removed them, and appointed others in
their stead, and imposed upon them the penalties of the law prescribed for
theft, they shall be sent to Us, not to be punished for their crime, but that
vengeance may be inflicted upon them.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof December, during the Consulate of Arcadius and
Bauto, 385.
4. The Same to Addeus, Count, and Commander of Both Armies.

Where any persons are hereafter oppressed with unjust burdens, and think they
should have recourse to petitions, either on account of matters relating to
navigation, or the transportation of merchandise, all rescripts which may be
issued with reference to matters of this kind must be addressed to your eminent
tribunal.
Given on the Idesof December, during the Consulate of Stilicho, Consul for the
second time, and Anthemius, 404.
TITLE XXVII.
CONCERNING THE OFFICE OF PRÆTORIAN PREFECT OF
AFRICA, AND THE CONDITION OF ALL THE PROVINCES OF
HIS JURISDICTION.
In the Name of Our Lord Jesus Christ.
1. The Emperor Caesar-Flavius-Justinianus, Alemannicus, Gothicus, Germanicus,
Francicus, Anticus, Alanicus, Vandalicus, Africanus, pious, fortunate,
illustrious, victor and triumpher, ever Augustus, to Archelaus, Praetorian
Prefect of Africa.
Our mind cannot conceive nor Our tongue express the thanks and the praise which
We should manifest to Our Lord Jesus Christ; for We have previously received
many benefits from God, and acknowledge that We have obtained many favors from
Him, for which We admit that We have done nothing to render Us worthy; and now
what Almighty God has deemed proper to manifest by Our agency for His own
praise, and the glory of His Name, exceeds by far all the wonderful occurrences
which have taken place during this century; as Africa through Our efforts has
received her freedom within a short time, after having for ninety years
previously been held in captivity by the Vandals, who are at the same time
enemies of both the soul and the body, since by rebaptism they have brought to
their perfidious belief such souls as were not able to endure the tortures and
punishments inflicted upon them, and the bodies of the latter, illustrious by
birth, were subjected to their barbaric yoke, by the exercise of the greatest
severity; and some of the Holy Churches of God were profaned with their
perfidy, and others were turned into stables. We saw venerable men who with
difficulty related their sufferings, whose tongues had been cut out by the
roots; and others who, after having endured various cruelties, and having been
dispersed through different provinces, passed their lives in exile. In what
terms, and with what labor could We give proper thanks to God, who rendered Me,
the most humble of His servants, worthy to avenge the wrongs of His Church, and
to rescue the people of so many provinces from the bond of servitude?
Our predecessors did not deserve this favor of God, as they were not only not
permitted to liberate Africa, but even saw Rome itself captured by the Vandals,
and all the Imperial insignia taken from thence to Africa. Now, however, God,
in his mercy, has not only delivered Africa and all her provinces into Our
hands, but the Imperial insignia as well, which, having been removed at the
capture of Rome, He has restored to us.
Therefore after Divinity has conferred upon Us so many benefits, We implored
the mercy of our Lord God, to keep firm and unimpaired the provinces which He
deigned to restore to Us, and that He would enable Us to govern them according
to His will and pleasure; so that all Africa might experience the mercy of the
Almighty, and its inhabitants might realize from what a severe captivity and
barbaric
yoke they had been released, and with what freedom they were entitled to remain
under Our most fortunate Empire.
With the intercession of the Holy, Glorious, and Immortal Virgin Mary, the
Mother of God, We implore and pray that God will, in His Name, through Us the
most humble of His servants, restore everything which has been taken from Our
Empire, and will render Us worthy of serving Him.
(1) With the assistance of God, and for the happiness of the State, We order by
this divine law that all Africa, which God in His mercy has conferred upon Us,
shall enjoy perfect order and have a prefecture of its own; so that, like that
of the Orient and of Illyria, Africa, by Our indulgence, may be adorned with
the highest praetorian dignity, whose seat We direct to be at Carthage, and that
its name be joined with those of the other prefectures, in the preamble of
public documents; and We now decree that Your Excellency shall govern it.
(2) From the aforesaid city, with the aid of God, seven provinces with their
judges shall be controlled, of which Tingi, Carthage, Bysatium, and Tripoli,
formerly under the jurisdiction of Proconsuls, shall have consular rulers;
while the others, that is to say, Numidia, Mauritania, and Sardinia shall, with
the aid of God, be subject to Governors.
(3) We decree that three hundred and ninety-six persons, distributed among the
different bureaus and military departments, shall be attached to your office,
as well as to that of all other succeeding Praetorian Prefects of Africa. We
also decree that fifty subordinates shall be attached to the office of each of
the provinces presided over by consular rulers, or Governors.
(4) The notice appended hereto specifies the emoluments to which You yourself,
as well as the said consular rulers and Governors, and each of their employees,
shall be entitled from the Public Treasury.
(5) We desire then that all Our judges shall, in accordance with the will and
fear of God, and Our choice and direction, endeavor to discharge their duties
in such a way that no one may be actuated by cupidity, commit violence himself,
or allow other judges or their subordinates, or any persons associated with
them to do so. For We shall have reason to rejoice if We should have,
throughout the provinces, with the assistance of God, officials free from
reproach; and We especially provide for the interests of those tributary to the
African jurisdiction, who, with God's assistance, can now perceive the light of
freedom after so long a captivity. Therefore, We order that all violence and
avarice shall cease, and that justice and truth shall prevail among all Our
tributaries, so that God will be pleased, and Our subjects themselves can more
rapidly be relieved and prosper, as do the others of Our Empire.
(6) We order the tax designated sportulaeto be collected not only by the
illustrious Praetorian Prefect of Africa, but also by the other judges, in the
way provided for by Our laws, which should be obeyed
throughout all Our Empire, and that no one shall presume at any time or in any
way to increase the amount of said tax.
(7) We have thought it best to prescribe by the present law that judges shall
not be obliged to incur great outlay for their letters or commissions, either
in Our court, or in the offices of the Praetorian Prefect of Africa; because if
they are not burdened with expense they will have no reason to oppress Our
African subjects. Therefore, We order that the judges of the African
jurisdiction, civil and military, shall not, in Our court, be charged more than
six solidifor their commissions, and the letters authorizing their promotion;
and that, in the office of the prefecture, they shall not be obliged to pay
more than twelve solidi.
If any judge should exceed the amount of the above-mentioned tax, he shall be
required to pay a fine of thirty pounds of gold, and he will not only be liable
to this fine, but also to the punishment of death. For if anyone should dare to
violate Our commands, and should not, with the fear of God, hasten to observe
them, he will run the risk of losing his office, and his property, as well as
of undergoing the extreme penalty.
(8) The notice above referred to, and which We, with the assistance of God have
drawn up, is as follows.1 ...
We have by this Divine Constitution fixed these sums to meet the expenses of
the civil magistrates of Africa and their subordinates, not only those attached
to the different departments of the prefecture itself but also to other
tribunals. Your Excellency shall see that they are paid and carried into effect
beginning with the Kalendsof September of the thirteenth coming indiction, and
you are hereby directed to give notice of this in public edicts addressed to
all persons.
We order, by the present Divine Constitution, that these regulations,
promulgated by you, shall be established for all time; and with the assistance
of God, by Our decree, We have also formulated them with reference to military
judges and their subordinate officials, and the remainder of Our army.
2. The Same to Belisarius, General of the Army of the East.
In all Our designs and undertakings, We proceed in the name of Our Lord Jesus
Christ, from whom We have received the rights of empire, through whom We have
established a lasting peace with the Persians, and with His aid, We have
defeated the most inveterate enemies and powerful tyrants, and have surmounted
the greatest difficulties; and also, by means of His aid, it has been granted
Us to defend Africa, and bring it under Our control. Likewise, with His
assistance, We trust that it will be governed properly under Our direction, and
firmly protected; wherefore, We have already, by the grace of God, appointed
judges of civil administration, and established offi-
1 I have omitted the long schedule of amounts to be paid by the numerous
subordinate officials and attaches of the Prefecture of Africa, for the reason
that the information it contains could not possibly be of any value to the
modern reader.  ED.
ces in each of the provinces of Africa, assigning to them such emoluments as
each should receive; and, committing Our soul to His Divine power, We are now
about to make a disposition of the various armies and their leaders.
(1) We order that the commander of the army of the Province of Tripoli shall
have his headquarters in the city of Leptis Magna. The military commander of
the Province of Byzacene shall alternately reside at Capsal, and the other
Leptis. The military commander of the Province of Numidia shall reside in the
city of Constantine. The military commander of the Province of Mauritania shall
have his headquarters in the city of Caesarea.
(2) We also order you to station at the point opposite Spain, which is called
Septa,1 a considerable body of troops with their tribune, who must be a prudent
man, and one who is devoted to Our Empire, who can always guard the strait, and
give information of everything that occurs in Spain, Gaul, or the country of
the Franks, to his commander, in order that he may communicate the information
to you; and you shall cause to be prepared for service in the strait as many
swift vessels as you may deem expedient.
(3) We order Your Excellency to appoint a military commander in Sardinia, and
provide as many soldiers as may be necessary to guard the places in his
jurisdiction, who shall be stationed near the mountains where the people of
Barbary are known to reside.
(4) Let those men to whose care the defence of the provinces has been entrusted
be vigilant and protect our subjects from being injured by incursions of the
enemy, and be ready to implore the aid of God, by day and by night, and exert
all their efforts to extend the boundaries of the provinces of Africa to that
point where the Roman Empire had its limits before the invasion of the Vandals
and the Moors, and where the ancient guards were posted; as is shown by the
forts and defences; and, moreover, let them, by all means, hasten to inclose
and fortify those cities which formerly were situated near the fortifications
which were erected when those regions were under Roman domination, when with
God's assistance the enemy was expelled from the said provinces. And, let them
dispatch officers and soldiers to those points where their boundaries were
situated at a time when all the provinces of Africa formed a part of the Roman
Empire, as, with the aid of God, through whose favor they have been restored to
Us, We hope speedily to be successful.
In order that these provinces may be preserved in security and peace, within
their ancient limits, through the vigilant efforts of our
1 Septa,the modern Ceuta, derived its name from the seven (septem)hills, upon
which, like Rome, it was constructed. The promontory nearest the sea was, in
ancient times, one of the far-famed Pillars of Hercules, so called by the
Phoenician navigators. Ceuta, of great historical interest, was one of the
earliest cities founded by human enterprise, its traditions far transcending in
antiquity those of venerable Damascus. From its harbor, the Moorish army of
Tarik, early in the seventh century, embarked for the conquest of the Spanish
Peninsula, whose success led to the establishment of the most opulent,
cultivated, and magnificent of mediaeval empires. It is now a Spanish penal
colony.  ED.
most devoted soldiers, and may remain intact under the care of Our illustrious
generals, it is proper that guards should always be stationed at the boundaries
of each province; in order that no opportunity may be afforded to the enemy to
invade or lay waste those places which are possessed by Our subjects.
(5) Your Excellency must determine, arrange, and report to Us, the number of
soldiers, either infantry or cavalry, which it is necessary to post at the
boundary for the purpose of guarding provinces and cities, so that if We
consider the provision which you have made to be sufficient, We may confirm it;
but if We think that something more should be done, We can increase the number.
(6) What the general is required to do with reference to himself and the men
under his command, and what his duty is is set forth in the following notice.
(7) Therefore, as has already been stated, while the officers and soldiers are
taking their positions in the places or towns to which We have ordered them to
go, in accordance with Our disposition of them; then, with the aid of God and
by Our efforts they can be stationed in those portions of Our dominions whose
former boundaries were defined, when the above-mentioned provinces constituted
an integral part of the flourishing Roman Empire.
(8) In order to maintain the boundaries it seemed necessary to Us that other
soldiers, in addition to those in the camps, should be posted along them, who
could defend the camps and cities situated there, as well as cultivate the
soil; so that, other inhabitants of the provinces, seeing them there, might
betake themselves to those places. We have made a list of the number of
soldiers to be appointed to guard the frontiers, to enable Your Excellency, in
accordance with the said list which We send to you, to make provision for their
distribution through the camps and other places; so that, if you should find
suitable detachments in the provinces, or where a military force was formerly
stationed, you can fix the number of frontier guards for each boundary; and if
any trouble should arise, these soldiers can, with their leaders, and without
the aid of those in the camps, defend the points where they have been
distributed; and neither they themselves nor their officers should extend the
boundaries; and all this must be done in such a way that the aforesaid frontier
guards may not be subjected to any expense by their officers and the latter may
not fraudulently convert any of their pay to their own use.
(9) We desire that these rules shall not only be observed by soldiers appointed
to guard the frontier, but also by those who are stationed in camp; and We
order that every commander, and the tribunes of said soldiers shall constantly
subject them to military exercises, and not permit them to wander about, so
that, if necessity should arise, they can offer resistance to the enemy. And no
general or tribune shall venture to give them leave of absence, lest while they
attempt to earn money for themselves, they may leave Our provinces unprotected;
for if any of the above-mentioned officers or their subordinates, or the
tribunes, should unlawfully attempt to withhold any pay from the sol-
diers, or to acquire any profit from their emoluments, We order that they shall
not only be condemned to publicly repay fourfold the amount appropriated, but
shall also be deprived of their offices; for the generals and tribunes should
expect a greater remuneration from Our liberality, in accordance with their
services, than any profit they could acquire in the manner above stated; as the
soldiers are appointed for the defence of the provinces, and We certainly
furnish sufficient pay to their generals and other officers, and always make
provision for their promotion to higher rank, and more important positions, in
proportion to their efficiency.
(10) After it may have pleased God for all the boundaries to be restored to
their ancient condition, and properly defined; and whenever necessity may
arise, the generals, in their turn, when the case requires it, can, with the
assistance of God, contribute by their vigilance and care to preserve the
provinces or their frontiers unimpaired.
(11) As We order Our judges and soldiers to be bold and fierce towards the
enemy; so We desire them to be gentle and kind towards Our subjects, and to
cause them no damage or injury. If, however, any soldier should dare to inflict
any wrong upon one of Our tributaries, he shall be punished in a manner worthy
of the commander, the tribune, and the Emperor, so that Our tributaries may be
secure from injustice.
(12) But if they should be interrogated before Our judges in any legal
proceeding, We order the bailiffs not to receive any more sportulae,1 than are
prescribed by Our laws, under penalty of suffering the punishment prescribed by
the said laws for their violation.
(13) Therefore when, with the aid of God, Our African provinces have been
placed at Our disposition by your grandeur, and their boundaries re-
established, and all Africa restored to its former condition;
1 Judgment with costs was not specifically asked for in the early ages of Roman
jurisprudence, since all legal expenses being considered to be included in the
decision as a matter of course, it would have been superfluous to mention them.
The practice of the tribunals was, in this respect, afterwards changed, and the
costs were taxed by the court, after the successful party to the suit had
solemnly made oath as to the amount which should be paid. If he demanded a
larger sum than was equitable, he lost his case; but in time, an assessment of
triple damages was substituted for this penalty.
Various provisions were, at intervals, made by law, regulating the payment of
costs. The plaintiff was obliged to file a bond to proceed within sixty days,
or pay double the expense which might be subsequently incurred. If the judge
failed to tax the costs, he was individually liable for them. As the amount
available for this purpose was ascertained by computing a certain percentage of
the value of the property in controversy, unscrupulous litigants were in the
habit of claiming more in their pleadings than they were entitled to, and where
this was proved, heavy damages could be collected. When evidence of bad faith
existed, the judge was authorized to impose a fine of one-tenth the amount for
which suit was brought, for the benefit of the Public Treasury.

The name comes from the baskets in which presents of provisions and other
articles formerly bestowed by patrons upon their clients were contained, and
which, in time, became applicable to the gifts themselves. These were

and these matters have been disposed of and effected by you with Divine
assistance; and you have reported to Us the establishment of all the dioceses
of Africa, that is, how many, and what soldiers have been stationed in certain
places or towns, and what frontier guards have been posted in what places, and
to what branch of the service they belong; We order that you shall then return
to Our presence.
(14) In the meantime, however, if Your Excellency should ascertain that certain
cities or castles situated near the boundaries are of too great extent to be
properly defended, you will take measures to have such fortifications
constructed as can be well garrisoned with a small number of men.
(15) When Your Excellency, having disposed of all these matters, has been
ordered to return to Us, the commanders of each boundary, whenever it becomes
necessary to make any new arrangements with reference to cities or camps, and
they have need of money to pay the troops, or for provisions, shall notify the
Illustrious Prefect of Africa, so that he may immediately do whatever is
requisite, in order that no injury may result to the province through delay.
(16) The said illustrious Praetorian Prefect of Africa, and the commanders of
the army, must frequently report to Us what they have effected, and what
remains to be accomplished, as well as everything which is taking place there;
in order that We may approve what has been properly done, and that what is
suitable to do hereafter may be carried out in accordance with Our wishes.
(17) We also decree that the judges appointed to preside over the frontiers of
Africa shall not pay to anyone, no matter what his rank or dignity, in Our Most
Sacred Palace in the Praetorian Prefecture of Africa, any more than the amounts
contained in the notice hereto annexed. For if anyone should unlawfully take or
accept any more than
donated by way of compensation for the public attendance of his followers upon
a patron. As was natural, what was at first gratuitous was afterwards exacted
as a right, and became subject to great abuse. Crowds of greedy clients, many
of whom were wealthy, flocked to the palaces of the Roman nobles, and were
given great quantities of food which, kept warm by means of heated vessels, was
transported through the streets on the heads of their perspiring slaves.
Juvenal refers to this custom, as follows:
"Nonne vides quanto celebretur sportula fume? Centum convivae; sequitur sua
quemque culina, Corbula vix ferret vasa ingentia, tot res Impostas capiti, quot
recto vertice portat Servulus infelix."(Juvenal, Satirae,III, 249.)
Money eventually took the place of other property in the bestowal of the
sportulaeand the term, through its original association with the legal
representative of the cliensin the tribunals, was employed to designate one
species of costs incurred in litigation. The sum fixed by custom was a hundred
quadrantes,equal to between five and six dollars. This fee, when paid to
members of the Roman bar, evoked the sarcasm of the satirist.
"Sed nee causidico possis impune negare Nec si te rhetor grammaticusve rogent:
Balnea post decimam lasso, centumque petuntur Quadrantes."(Martial, Epig.X,

is specified in the said notice, he shall pay thirty pounds of gold by way of
fine, and, in addition, run the risk of Our resentment; and no person, no
matter what his rank or dignity may be, shall receive anything from the said
judges, with the exception of those whose names are included in the notice
hereto attached.
(18) For this purpose We (with the assistance of God) order that every military
commander and his subordinates shall, in accordance with the notice hereto
annexed, receive their pay from the tributes of the Province of Africa, from
the Kalendsof next September, of the thirteenth most fortunate indiction.
(19) This notice, God willing, shall be sent to the military commanders and
their offices established in Africa, to secure their support and payment each
year.1 ...
TITLE XXVIII. CONCERNING THE DUTIES OF THE PREFECT OF THE CITY.
1. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Volusianus, Urban Prefect.
Desiring to firmly establish the condition of the City, and the distribution of
provisions, it has occurred to Us that this duty should not be entrusted to
everyone; and in order that the Prefecture of the City may not think that any
of its functions have been abrogated, if the entire obligation of providing for
subsistence should be taken from it, We direct that it shall all be committed
to the supervision of the prefecture; not in such a way, however, that the
office of the Prefecture of Subsistence may lie dormant, but that the two
offices may have charge of the distribution of provisions, according to the
interest of each of them, and that the official duties may jointly be
discharged by them in such a way that the one of inferior rank may recognize
the superiority of the other, and the one of greater authority may be conducted
so that it may be known what is due to the Prefect of Subsistence, without
mentioning the fact.
2. The Same to Ampelius, Urban Prefect.
Although you are not ignorant of what has been stated in Our Rescript with
reference to laws which have been promulgated, it is proper that you should
observe them, in accordance with what We have stated, and not think that you
can summon before you any other persons of the province except your
subordinates, and men belonging to the populace of this Fair City, who have
been accused of sedition.
3. The Emperors Valens, Gratian, and Valentinian to Rufinus, Urban Prefect.
The Urban Prefecture shall take precedence in dignity and power over all the
remaining ones of the City, no matter from what source

they are derived; provided it does not, by usurping honors or functions
belonging to others, cause injury and wrong.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Valens and
Valentinian Junior, 368.
4. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Severinus, Count of
the Sacred Largesses.
Know that every kind of corporate body which exists in the City of
Constantinople, and all the citizens and populace, are subject to the
jurisdiction of the Urban Prefecture.
5. The Emperor Theodosius to Constantine, Urban Prefect.
The Primicerius?who has been the assistant of your office for two years, and
who, in accordance with the custom of ancient times, has discharged his duties
for that period, shall have charge of Our correspondence, provided he abandons
all usurpation and corrupt intriguing for office; and it should be added, that
if anyone belonging to the order above mentioned is shown to have lost his rank
in the army either by death, or for any other reason, his place must be
supplied without paying attention to the aspirations of anyone, by the
appointment of him who occupies the highest position in the public register.
TITLE XXIX. CONCERNING THE OFFICE OF GENERAL OF THE ARMY.
1. The Emperors Valentinian, Gratian, and Theodosius to Eugenius, Praetorian
Prefect.
The illustrious counts and commanders of infantry and cavalry have absolutely
no authority over the people of the provinces, nor has the prefecture any over
the soldiers.
2. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Hypatius, General of the East.
The subordinates of your office appointed throughout the East shall not be
summoned before any other tribunal than yours. Know, therefore, that they must
bring their actions before you, whether they be civil or criminal.
3. The Emperor Zeno to Sebastian, Praetorian Prefect.
We order that all subordinates who have been appointed to office under the
command of the General of the East shall be subject to the jurisdiction of all
civil judges in any matter in which they are interested; as there is no doubt
that those of them who are tributary are not obliged to obey the decisions of
civil judges.
1 Primiceriuswas a title bestowed upon various Byzantine officials of superior
dignity, and was derived from the fact that their names were the first
inscribed upon the waxen tablets, or public registers of their Order.  ED.
4. The Emperor Anastasius to John, Military Commander of Illyria.
We order that soldiers shall not be transferred from the points where they are
at present stationed, to other places, without Our express authority, nor shall
their pay be diminished while they remain in the same garrison; but if anything
urgent or necessary should arise requiring their removal, application should be
made, without delay, to the Praetorian Prefect, as well as to yourself, where
the public welfare and safety are involved; in order that you may bring the
facts to Our notice, stating the places from which the soldiers should be
transferred, as well as those to which they ought to be sent, and the names of
the principal commanders under whose orders the said soldiers shall be, as well
as the amount of provisions required; and, above everything else, for what
reason the said soldiers should be transferred, so that, after having received
this information, proper measures may be taken by Us.
5. The Emperor Justinian to Zeta, Military Commander of Armenia, Pontus, and
elsewhere.
The government of the Roman Empire having been conferred upon Us through the
favor of the Almighty, with a view to administering it with zealous care and
cautious diligence, We have deemed it necessary to appoint by this law a
military commander for Armenia, Pontus, and other provinces; and, confiding in
your great abilities, which have been brought to Our knowledge by your former
achievements, We have selected you as being fitted for the office; and, having
entrusted to your care certain provinces, that is to say, those of Greater
Armenia, which is called Central Armenia, namely, Anzitena, Acilisena,
Hobordena, Sophena and First and Second Armenia, as well as Polemoniac Pontus,
together with their Governors; the Count of Armenia having been removed, We
place under your command all bodies of soldiers, not only those which We have
raised at the present time, but also those already in service in the East and
elsewhere. We did not diminish their number but have even added to it, without
imposing an additional burden upon the State; and although We have discharged
some without additional expense, even after their dismissal the number still
remains larger than at the time of Our accession to the throne.
TITLE XXX. CONCERNING THE DUTIES OF QUÆSTOR.
1. The Emperor Theodosius to Salustius, Quaestor.
Know that the charge of the entire smaller register of the names of public
officials is committed to your charge, so that all the offices contained
therein, that is to say, the prefectures, the tribuneships, and the commanders
of camps, shall be bestowed in accordance with your judgment, and afterwards,
as is customary, sent to Us for confirmation.
Given at Constantinople, on the sixth of the Kalendsof May, under the Consulate
of Castinus and Victor, 424.
2. The Same to Helio, Count, and Master of the Offices.
I hereby decree that all the offices enumerated in the smaller register, which
were formerly considered to be under the care and in charge of the illustrious
Quaestor, and were afterwards transferred with the authority attaching thereto,
and either wholly or in part placed at the disposition of military commanders,
shall hereafter be subject to the control of the Quaestor, in accordance with
the custom of ancient times.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof May, during the above-mentioned Consulate,
424.
3. The Emperor Anastasius to Eusebius, Master of the Offices.
It shall be lawful for no one, under any circumstances whatsoever, without Our
written authority duly signed by Us, to discharge the various duties of the
offices belonging to Our Bureau of Petitions; and anyone who hereafter may be
convicted of this offence, shall be punished with the confiscation of his
property; and if any person in the province should dare, on his own
responsibility, to usurp these functions, and the Governor of said province
should fail to obtain for him the alleged rescript upon which he based his
authority, he shall be punished with a fine of three pounds of gold.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of
Anastasius and Rufinus, 492.
TITLE XXXI. CONCERNING THE DUTIES OP MASTER OF THE OFFICES.
1. The Emperor Constantine to Those who Transact the Public Business.
The privileges formerly granted to your class are preserved intact, but no one
shall obtain the employment of Ducenarius, Centenarius,1or Hiarchia,by favor,
but through merit; and your superior shall be appointed according to his place
upon the register, so that those who are entitled to the position, as well as
their assistants, may discharge their duties in accordance with priority of
service. Moreover, the condition of the entire class, and the security of the
chief, demand that the latter be a man of good morals, and endowed with the
proper qualifications, and that he be presented to Us by the Master in order to
be confirmed, if We should deem it proper.

1 These designations were given to the procurators on account of their
respective salaries of two hundred and one hundred sesterces.The persons
referred to in the text, however, were magistrates of inferior rank, the
appraisement of whose property did not exceed the sums above mentioned.  ED.
2. The Emperors Valentinian, Arcadius, and Theodosius, to Patricius, Master of
the Offices.
No one belonging to the class of Public Business Agents shall violate the rules
prescribed for promotion in the civil or military service, even though he may
have fraudulently obtained Our authority to do so; and if anyone should be
proved to have been guilty of conduct of this kind, he shall be degraded to the
position from which he was illegally promoted, so that he who is entitled to
preference, either through his services or his labors, may be advanced in rank.
3. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Pleitius, Count and Master of the
Offices.
The devotion shown by Our scholariito Our ancestors has caused Us to entertain
the greatest affection for them, and therefore We have thought that anything
which has reference to the maintenance and preservation of their privileges
should be granted without hesitation. Hence, approving your suggestion, We
refuse the said scholariipermission to whip or degrade Senators and
Ducenarii;and We desire that information of any offences which deserve such
punishment shall be given to your tribunal.
4. The Same to Nomus, Master of the Offices.
We have thought that it should be made a part of the duties of your office to
file an annual report, stating the number of soldiers on every boundary subject
to your jurisdiction, as well as the condition of the camps and fortresses
situated there.
Given at Constantinople, on the second of the Idesof September, before the
Consulate of Maximus, Consul for the second time, and Paterius, 443.
5. The Emperor Justinian to Tatian, Master of the Offices.
We order that only those shall be included in a body of Our devoted
scholariiwho merit Our favor, and that anyone who has the administration of
your tribunal temporarily shall not be allowed to admit a member into this
respectable Order without Our approval, and he who, without the authority of a
rescript, dares to assume this rank, is hereby notified that he shall not only
be deprived of it, but shall also be subjected to a fine of twenty pounds of
gold.
(1) We also wish the following rule to be observed, namely, that when anyone
vacates the office or place of a scholarius,he whom We have authorized by Our
Rescript to occupy the vacant position shall be appointed in his stead.
(2) We desire that, so long as you exercise the functions of Master of the
Offices, you will make a report every four months of the condition of the
scholarii.This report should be sent to, and deposited in the Bureau of
Registers, in order that We may always have information of the said
scholarii,and that no injury may result to the State.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof May, at Constantinople, during the
Consulate of Mavortius, 523.
TITLE XXXII.
CONCERNING THE DUTIES OF COUNT OF THE SACRED LARGESSES.
1. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Count Limenius.
The principal duty of the Palatines is at their own risk to give Us information
of the negligence of judges through the notaries designated for that purpose,
so that, if the case demands it, their failure to perform their duty may not go
unpunished.
(1) It is also proper for them to report the names of judges who pay more
attention to their own business than to the public welfare; and they are hereby
notified that, every four months, they must send reports to the office of the
Palatines, and that any money collected by them must be forwarded without delay
to the Treasury of the Sacred Largesses.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Honorius,
Consul for the seventh time, and Theodosius, Consul for the second time, 407.
TITLE XXXIII.
CONCERNING THE DUTIES OF COUNT OF PRIVATE AFFAIRS.
1. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Honoratus, of Consular Rank, at
Bysantium.
Where transactions have taken place on account of which it is evident that
something is owing to the Treasury, you shall transmit information of the same
to the office of the Count of Private Affairs, so that he may make an
investigation, and ascertain by the aid of the law what is due.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Valentinian and Valens, Consul for the second time, 368.
TITLE XXXIV.
CONCERNING THE DUTIES OF COUNT OF THE IMPERIAL PALACE.

The duty of collecting what is due to Us, as well as any revenue from perpetual
leases, that is to say, from emphyteutical contracts, belongs to the Palatines.
Given at Milan, on the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of Caesarius and
Atticus.
2. The Same to Ursatius, Count of Private Affairs.If any illustrious judge, or
Prefect of the City, thinking that he had jurisdiction of some matter which
belongs to the Department of
Private Affairs, should claim it for himself, or if he should resist any
decision of the tribunal aforesaid, his office shall be liable to the penalty
of fifty pounds of gold, which must be collected without delay, and paid into
Our Treasury.
Given at Ravenna, on the sixth of the Idesof August, during the Consulate of
Constantius and Constantine, 397.
TITLE XXXV. CONCERNING THE DUTIES OF PROCONSUL AND DEPUTY.
1. The Emperor Constantine to Ælianus, Proconsul of Africa.

they find that sentence should be passed upon the culprits, they must not delay
to send them to the Proconsul.1
TITLE XXXVI.
CONCERNING THE DUTIES OF THE COUNT OF THE IMPERIAL PATRIMONY.
1. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Simplicius, Proconsul of Asia.
The Governor of the Hellespont having gone to Our Father, and informed him of
the inconvenience to which he had been subjected by the subordinates of the
Deputy, asked for authority to appear before your tribunal, and that pious
prince being influenced by his representations granted him permission. This
rule We decide shall stand.
TITLE XXXVII. CONCERNING THE DUTIES OF COUNT OF THE EAST.
1. The Emperor Leo to Useus, Praetorian Prefect.
We order that information shall be furnished Us with reference to those who
have been appointed to the government of Lycia and Syria, in Upper Syria, by
the Count of the East, as well as by the illustrious Governor of the province.
Let the supervision of the games of Lycia be entrusted to the care of the Count
of the East, and those of Syria be placed under the supervision of the
illustrious Governor of
1 There were several kinds of Legati,or representatives of the Emperor, known
as deputies or lieutenants, a term which includes ambassadors accredited both
to and from foreign powers, as well as military officers. Those referred to
here belonged to the latter class who, appointed with the consent of the
Senate, by the general or Governor to whose administration they were attached,
discharged the duties incumbent upon him in case of his absence or incapacity.
Being ordinarily men of senatorial or consular dignity, they were well
qualified to act as advisers of their general, but so long as he was present,
they were not invested with independent authority. Their number varied from
three to fifteen.  ED.
the province, and let permission be refused the members of the curiaeto
discharge this duty or enjoy this honor, even if they desire to do so. Given on
the fifth of the Ides of November, during the Consulate of Basilicus and
Armerus.
TITLE XXXVIII. CONCERNING THE OFFICE OF AUGUSTAL PREFECT.
1. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Florentius, Augustal
Prefect.
We order that all tributes due by the Department of Egypt shall be committed by
yourself to the collection of the governors of those provinces. If any
possessors of property, whether they are soldiers or not, shall dare to refuse
to pay what is due, We order that they shall be compelled to do so by the aid
of military force, if the case demands it.
2. The Emperors Theodosius, Arcadius, and Honorius to Rufinus, Praetorian
Prefect.
The Augustal Praetorian Prefect shall have power to inquire into any crimes
committed by judges under his jurisdiction, and to make reports with reference
to them, but he shall not have power to remove them from office or punish them.
TITLE XXXIX. CONCERNING THE OFFICE OF VICEGERENT.
1. The Emperors Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian to Antony, Praetorian Prefect.
In the investigation of civil matters, it is proper that vicegerents should
take precedence of military counts, and that the latter should have priority in
affairs relating to the army. Whenever they are associated in rendering
decisions, the vicegerent shall take precedence, and the count shall be
considered as assistant; for as the office of Prefect is superior to others, so
that of vicegerent discloses by its name that it possesses a portion of its
pre-eminence, is clothed in Imperial power, and usually represents the respect
due to Our jurisdiction.
2. The Same to Hesperius, Praetorian Prefect.
The reports of vicegerents, when circumstances demand it, shall be referred to
Us, for We willingly hear the reports of judges, since the authority of their
administration might seem to be diminished if We rejected their applications,
as We do the petitions presented by ordinary persons.
TITLE XL. CONCERNING THE DUTIES OF PRÆTOR.
1. The Emperor Constantine to the Senate.
Jurisdiction is conferred upon the Praetor, by Our order, to hear and examine
matters having reference to freedom. It is eminently proper that judgment
should be rendered by him, for if a case involving complete restitution has
been referred to him, and the reasons for the same are approved, he should
render a decree; or where a guardian is to be appointed, or a curator
confirmed, he must also interpose a decree, just as where a slave can, with the
consent of his patron, be liberated in his presence. The duties of parents to
their children do not, however, cease on this account, when they release them
from their power, but still maintain control over them; as they understand that
their children owe them even more submission when they remember that they have
been released from parental authority by them.
2. The Emperors Valentinian and Martian to Tatian, Praetorian Prefect.
We order that only three Praetors shall be elected and appointed by the Senate
for this City every year, who shall hear and determine all proper causes and
actions which may be brought before them; but only those shall be appointed who
have their residence in this Fair City, and not in the provinces.
No one shall be appointed to the office of Praetor who has happened to come for
other purposes from any other province to this City, but only those (as has
already been stated), who have their domicile here; still, they should not be
compelled to incur any expense against their will, but are free to dispense
such liberality as they may desire.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the
Consulate of Valentinian, Consul for the seventh time, and Avienus, 450.
TITLE XLI.
CONCERNING THE DUTIES OF THE GOVERNOR OF A PROVINCE.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Julian.
The Governor of a province who has cognizance of a case of forgery can decide
any question of ownership involved in the transaction.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and Urbanus, 225.
2. The Emperor Constantine to Maximian, Governor of the Province.
Governors of provinces must neither hear nor determine cases in which any
powerful person is interested whom they cannot punish,
but must report him to Us, or give notice of the case to the Praetorian
Prefecture, by which provision may be made for the maintenance of public order,
and for the redress of wrongs inflicted upon persons who are weak.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Probiamus and
Julian, 322.
3. The Same to the People of the Provinces.
We grant to all persons permission to praise just and vigilant judges by their
acclamations, to enable Us to promote and increase their distinction; and on
the other hand, We allow those who are unjust and malevolent to be publicly
denounced, so that the severity of Our censure may be visited upon them; for if
the complaints are true and are not attributable to the irregularities of
clients, We shall make a diligent investigation, and for this reason the
Praetorian Prefects and the counts appointed for the provinces must bring the
complaints of Our provincials to Our notice.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of
Bassus and Ablavius, 331.
4. The Same to Pericles, Governor of the Province.
We have conferred upon you authority to punish the officers of prefects who
disturb the public order, or plot against the general welfare, in order that
you may convince the prefects of their guilt.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of
Constantius and Albinus, 335.
5. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Apronian, Urban Prefect.
Proper respect must be shown by inferior judges to their superiors. Where,
however, the public welfare is concerned, and a judge of inferior rank is
investigating the truth of a case, no wrong is committed against his superior.
It is certain that anyone who performs the functions of his office in such a
way as to believe that he ought to heap unmerited abuse upon persons who are
lawfully invested with official authority will not escape the effects of Our
resentment.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Arinthius and
Modestus, 372.
6. The Emperors Valentinian, Oration, and Theodosius to Cynegius, Praetorian
Prefect.
The city of the Rhodians has made complaint of its injury in an improper
manner, and too late. Wherefore, We decree by this law, which must inviolably
be observed, that, as during the season of winter navigation is always
dangerous and frequently uncertain, the judges shall sit in the five cities
which are considered to be the principal ones, by turns, passing one winter in
one, and another in another. If anyone should be convicted of violating this
Our decree, he shall
be fined fifty pounds of silver, and his office a hundred (if it was involved
in such a breach of the law), to be paid into Our Treasury.
7. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodore, and Arcadius to Synegius, Praetorian
Prefect.
When anyone invested with ordinary authority is guilty of any wrong, under the
pretext that he should be transferred, he shall be compelled to remain in the
province, and make good out of his own property, and at the expense of his
reputation and fortune, the injuries which he has committed.
Given at Constantinople, on the seventh of the Kalendsof June, during the
Consulate of the Most Noble Youth Honorius, and Evodius, 396.
8. The Same to Cynegius, Praetorian Prefect.
Let no judge think that he has the right to appoint in his province anyone
attached to the prefecture, the palace, or the army, or who may have previously
held offices of this kind, a surety or an attorney to represent a litigant in
some private or public matter; for he who does so will commit an offence
against Our authority, and will not only be subjected to the loss of
reputation, but also to the impairment of his estate.
Given at Constantinople, on the Nonesof August, during the Consulate of our
Emperor Honorius and Evodius, 395.
9. The Same to Polemius, Praetorian Prefect.
Let no Governor of a province presume to come to this most August City without
Our order, for if anyone should be proved to have done so contrary to the
provisions of Our decree, he shall be punished with a suitable penalty.
Given at Milan, on the tenth of the Kalendsof January, after the Consulate of
Timasius and Promotus, 390.
10. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Limenius, Count of the Sacred
Largesses.
We desire that no commerce should exist with the Palatines who are subject to
your order, and the people of the province; but the judges should know that
they are especially required to demand and collect the usual taxes from the
latter; and the possessor of property should not be prejudiced against the
Palatine who is instructed to warn him, not for himself, but as the
representative of the judges and their officers.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof April.
11. The Emperors Arcadius, Honorius, and Theodosius to Theodore, Praetorian
Prefect.
We order that the Governors of provinces shall see that the agents of powerful
persons are not guilty of anything wrong or unjust.
Given at Ravenna, on the sixth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate
of Bassus and Philip, 408.
12. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Monachius, Praetorian Prefect.
We order that all the subordinate provincial officials who have abused their
authority shall, in the discretion of the judge, be deprived of their offices,
and if the case demands it, be beaten with rods, in order that this sentence of
a criminal judgment may be the more easily executed, the insolence of officials
repressed, and the consideration to which judges are entitled be restored by
this act of severity.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of Honorius,
Consul for the ninth time, and Theodosius, Consul for the fifth time, 412.
13. The Emperor Leo to Constantine, Praetorian Prefect.
If anyone, while still attached to the public service, should in any way obtain
the government of a province, or any military office whatsoever, he shall be
deprived of it as having usurped or obtained it contrary to law, even if he
should voluntarily renounce the right of governing the province, or the
military or other employment conferred upon him by Our liberality.
Given on the seventh of the Idesof August, during the Consulate of Leo, Consul
for the fourth time, and Probian, 471.
14. The Same to the Same Praetorian Prefect.
It shall be lawful for no judge, having jurisdiction in any province, or
residing in any city in which are situated Imperial or praetorian palaces, to
leave the latter, and demand the houses of private individuals for the purpose
of residing or holding court therein; but judges shall, under all
circumstances, be compelled to reside in the Imperial or praetorian palaces, and
are required to make all necessary repairs in them. When, however, there is
both an Imperial and a praetorian palace in the city, the Imperial palace shall
be set apart for the residence of the Governor, and the praetorian palace shall
be used as a warehouse to receive and keep safely public property, or anything
else which may be necessary.
If anyone, at any time, should attempt to violate this law, We order that he,
as well as his office, shall be fined fifty pounds of gold for the purpose of
repairing the palace which he neglected.
Given on the seventh of the Idesof February, during the Consulate of
Clementinus and Probus.

CONCERNING THE OFFICE OF THE PREFECT OF THE WATCH.

Bassus and Philip, 408.
2. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Anthemius, Praetorian Prefect.
If anyone desires to defend himself by the payment of a sum to which he is

his errand to him; and if the judge should be unwilling to hear him (which we
do not think probable), he himself shall be fined thirty pounds of gold, and
his subordinate officer fifty.
Given at Constantinople, on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof August, during the
Consulate of Honorius, Consul for the eighth time, and Theodosius, Consul for
the third time, 409.

Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Idesof February, during the
Consulate of Theodosius, Consul for the third time, and Abundantius, 393.
2. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Monachius, Praetorian Prefect.
We order that neither members of the curiaenor private persons shall be summoned

1. The Emperors Arcadius, Honorius, and Theodosius to Anthemius, Praetorian
Prefect.
We order that no inconvenience shall be caused to either the curiaeor the
cities, and that no private bath shall be furnished by them for the use of
tribunes or any other military officers, and that no additional compensation
shall be granted on this account. For We confer this privilege only upon
distinguished counts and generals of the army (if they desire it), and We order
that those who violate this law shall have a penalty of double damages imposed
upon them.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof December, during the Con- . sulate of
Arcadius, Consul for the fifth time, and Probus, 406.
TITLE XLVIII. CONCERNING THE DUTIES OF VARIOUS JUDGES.
1. The Emperor Constantine to Domitius Celsus, Vicegerent.
Let no judge think that an officer may be sent with an order to a house in
which the mother of a family resides, for the purpose of publicly arresting
her, as it is certain that the debts of one who, on account of her sex, remains
at home, can be paid by the sale of her house, or any of her property; because
if anyone should, after this, believe that the mother of a family can be
publicly arrested, he shall be reckoned among the greatest of criminals, and be
condemned to the penalty of death, without any indulgence whatever.
Given on the fourth of the Idesof August, during the Consulate of Sabinus and
Rufinus, 316.
Extract from Novel 134, Chapter IX. Latin Text.
At present, however, in accordance with the new law, no woman can be imprisoned
either for a debt due to the Treasury, or for a private obligation; but she
should either appear herself, or by her attorney, or send one or more persons,
according to the number legally required under the circumstances. If anything
is done contrary to this law, superior judges shall be punished with a fine of
twenty pounds of gold, and inferior ones with a fine of ten. Moreover, those
who have obeyed them shall be deprived of office, subjected to corporeal
penalties, and condemned to exile.
2. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Principius, Urban
Prefect.
All judges are hereby notified that honor should be paid to persons of exalted
rank, and to such of these as are sometimes brought into court, nor shall they
presume to style them brothers in their official documents; and the subordinate
officials charged with this duty shall be fined if they violate the law.
Given on the Idesof February, during the Consulate of Richomer
and Clearchus, 324.
3. The Same to Constantius, Praetorian Prefect of the Gauls.
Let all generals, trumpeters, commanding officers, and judges know that they
will be condemned to a fine of three pounds of gold, to be collected out of
their property, if entrance to the private office of judges is refused those
eminent personages who have the right of admission to Our Council Chamber; or
the respect due to them is not shown in saluting them; or the privilege of
sitting with the judges is denied them.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof November, during the Consulate of Trimasius
and Promotus, 389.
TITLE XLIX.
ALL JUDGES, CIVIL AS WELL AS MILITARY, SHALL REMAIN FOR FORTY DAYS AFTER THEIR
TERM OF OFFICE HAS EXPIRED IN THE TOWNS OR PLACES WHERE THEY DISCHARGED THEIR
DUTIES.
1. The Emperor Zeno to Sebastian, Praetorian Prefect.
No illustrious Governor of a province, consular ruler, magistrate, or anyone
who has received the insignia of the administration of a higher office, that is
to say, the illustrious proconsuls, augustal prefects, Counts of the East, or
deputies of provinces, or any general or commander of a division of the army,
or any count of the Imperial Palace, shall after he has been succeeded, presume
to leave the place which he is known to have ruled before the prescribed term
of fifty days has elapsed; but, during that time, Governors and consular
rulers, the distinguished judges civil as well as military, and other
magistrates, shall reside openly in the principal city where they have
exercised jurisdiction, and shall not conceal themselves in their own houses,
or on the frontiers, or in any fortified buildings, but shall appear before all
the persons whom they formerly governed, and in the most public places; so that
every one may have ample opportunity to file complaints against them, for theft
or other crimes; and that everyone may be defended from injury by his
successor; and if he should be accused, it will be at the risk of his office,
as well as of that of the curiaand the defender of the city; and, having given
his oath as security, after he has been brought into court, he can defend
himself against those who complain of him (as already stated), and protect
himself by means of the law.
No excuse shall be allowed him for departing from the province before the
prescribed time has elapsed, either on account of an Imperial summons, or
because of the offer of another administration in compliance with an order from
your illustrious tribunal, appointing him to the place of a Governor of another
province in obedience to a notice from the above mentioned, or any other civil
or military authority whatsoever (no matter what public office he holds), which
may be either produced or drawn up; and finally, the practice of any stratagem
or artifice of any kind must be excluded, so that Our commands may take effect
in every way by which We provide for the safety of all Our provinces.
If, however, anyone should, with a rashness worthy of punishment, think that
this most salutary law may be evaded or violated, although he may not
unreasonably be considered guilty of high treason, still, he shall be compelled
to pay a fine of fifty pounds of gold to the Public Treasury, and a similar
penalty shall be imposed upon the official who succeeded him, and did not adopt
proper measures to place him under restraint, or neglected immediately to give
information of his flight.
(1) We do not wish for an official to surrender his administration before his
successor has reached the boundaries of the province, even though he may have
been notified by letters, or an Edict addressed to his office or to the people
of the province, that he has been superseded.
(2) Anyone, then, who by taking to flight, does not observe the present law,
can be brought back by your order, or that of the illustrious Governor of the
province, from wherever he may be found, even in this Most Flourishing City,
and conducted without any obstacle to the place which he has ruled, and be
compelled to remain there for the space of six months; so that, in the
meantime, any crimes or thefts which he may have committed may not remain
concealed, and the official who did not prevent him from departing against the
tenor of the law (as he was in honor bound to do), shall be fined thirty pounds
of gold.
(3) If, however, during the said term of fifty days, he should be accused
before the above-mentioned time has elapsed, and the case should not be
terminated, and he should be civilly prosecuted for theft, and have appointed
an attorney, after the fifty days have expired, he shall have the right to
depart; but if he has been criminally accused, and there is documentary
evidence against him, he will be compelled to remain in that place until the
trial has been concluded.
(4) All judges, before whom, on account of their right of jurisdiction, or by
the order of your illustrious tribunal, either civil or criminal cases may be
brought, are hereby notified that they must end the above-mentioned litigation
within twenty days after it has been begun; and if they should permit this time
to be exceeded, We direct that they themselves shall be sentenced to pay a fine
of ten pounds of gold, and any criminal prosecution or civil action which has
been instituted before their courts shall be legally terminated by the lapse of
the
aforesaid term.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifth of the Idesof October, during the
Consulate of Zeno, Consul for the second time, 479.
Extract from Novel 8, Chapter IX. Latin Text.
If, however, the judge, having taken to flight before the expiration of the
fifty days aforesaid, should be detained by persons in the province, everything
which has been illegally paid on this account shall be collected by an action
of theft, and the case shall be heard without committing the proceedings to
writing, in the presence of the bishop alone.
TITLE L.
CONCERNING THE DUTIES OF ONE WHO TAKES THE PLACE OF A JUDGE OR A GOVERNOR.
1. The Emperor Gordian to Domitius, Praetorian Prefect.
No doubt has ever arisen that the official who administers the affairs of a
province in the place of a Governor can take cognizance of matters which have
reference to the public welfare. For it is certain
that if the rights of the State have in any way been infringed, the public
defenders can, after having notified the Emperor, demand the relief of
restitution (provided they think that the case requires it).
Given on the third of the Nonesof November, during the Consulate of Sabinus,
Consul for the second time, and Venustus, 241.
2. Mandates of the Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian, sent to Antiochus and
other Praetorian Prefects.
They are as follows: "Your Highness having suggested that the Imperial Majesty,
having been informed, should grant authority to those who, by the order of the
Emperor, or by that of your tribunal, are known to hold the office of Governors
of provinces, to appoint guardians or curators for those persons demanding
them, and to interpose their decrees where the alienations of minors and other
persons of this kind are concerned, and invest them with the authority of
persons belonging to the curiae,and allow them to grant emancipations, and to do
all other things pertaining to the jurisdiction of the Governor of a province;
in accordance with the statements of Your Highness, We have deemed it proper to
order that they shall have permission to perform all acts of this kind above
mentioned."
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Idesof October, during the
Consulship of Hierius and Ardaburius, 427.
TITLE LI.
CONCERNING ASSESSORS, ATTENDANTS AND THE CHANCELLORS OF JUDGES.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Paulinus, Praetorian Prefect.
The labor of study is meritorious, so that where those who are appointed to
public office desire to have associated with them persons who can give them
advice, they may call to their aid men whose wisdom they think is essential,
whom they should inspire with the hope of rewards and honors, and not compel
their services by arousing a terrible fear and necessity which is inconsistent
with freedom.
Given on the day before the Idesof July, during the Consulate of Tiberius and
Maximus.
2. The Emperor Constantine to Bassus, Urban Prefect.
Governors must sign documents, not by their assessors, but with their own
hands, but if any one of them should allow an assessor to attach his signature
without having consulted Us, the assessor who signed the document shall be sent
into exile; and We order that the name of the Governor shall be communicated to
Us, in order that he may be severely punished.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of
Constantine, Consul for the sixth time, and Constantine-Caesar, 329.
3. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Messala, Praetorian Prefect.
We order that counsellors of judges, chancellors, and those who perform the
duties of attendants, shall remain for the term of fifty days in the province,
after their term of office has expired. If any one of these, having been
accused, should take to flight, he will be considered to have confessed, and We
order that he shall restore fourfold the sum which he is said to have
appropriated, so that the person who has been robbed may receive double the
amount, and our Treasury the
same.
Given at Milan on the sixth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Theodosius and Rumoridius, 403.
4. The Same and Theodosius to Caelicianus, Vicegerent.
A court bailiff is not permitted to transact public business, and if he should
be convicted of having meddled with it, he must immediately be examined by the
Governor, in order that he may inflict suitable punishment upon him.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof April, during the Consulate of Honorius,
Consul for the sixth time, and Aristenetus, 404.
5. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Seleucus, Praetorian Prefect.
No one who has once performed the duties of bailiff or chancellor1in the
provinces is permitted to do so again under any circumstances whatever.
Given at Ravenna, on the third of the Idesof December, during the Consulate of
Honorius, Consul for the tenth time, and Theodosius, Consul for the sixth time.
6. The Same to Vitalianus, Commander of Lydia.No subordinate of a general or
other military commander, who is included among his retinue, shall venture to
aspire to the same office
1 The Roman cancellarius,from whom is derived our chancellor, was originally a
doorkeeper of the tribunals, stationed at the lattice which separated the
judges from the audience. He also carried messages and papers from the
petitioners to the magistrates, and to a certain extent, resembled the modern
bailiff. In time his vocation was materially altered, and he became an official
of vastly higher rank, greater responsibility, and more importance than a mere
court attendant, being entrusted with the drawing up of instruments and the
keeping of public records; thus, in general, discharging the duties of an
Imperial secretary or notary, until finally, his employment assumed a judicial
character, and he became the acknowledged superior of, and exercised
supervision over, all the civil functionaries of the government.
This office, like many others, survived the wreck of the Empire, and was
retained by most of the mediaeval kingdoms and principalities which rose upon
its ruins, and especially by the Catholic Church, every diocese of which still
has its chancellor, who presides over its consistory and interprets the Canon
Law.
The post of chancellor is of high antiquity in England, dating back to an
unknown period of the Saxon domination, and at all times, the dignitary
invested with it enjoyed the highest consideration, to which of course his
sacerdotal char-
a second time, after his term has expired; and anyone who presumes to violate
this law shall be condemned to pay a fine of ten pounds of gold, and the same
penalty shall be imposed upon the office to which he is attached, if it has
rashly consented to any of these things through desire for popularity, or
avarice.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of
Honorius, Consul for the eleventh time, and Constantius, Consul for the second
time, 417.
acter essentially contributed. The origin of the term is not positively known,
but is generally supposed to be derived from the power of cancelling iniquitous
laws possessed by this important functionary, as is disclosed in the following
verses, addressed to Thomas a Becket.
"Quaerendus Regni tibi Cancellarius Angli Primus sollicita mente petendus erit
Hic est, qui Regni leges cancellat iniquas, Et mandata pii Principis aequa
facit. Quid obest populo, vel moribus est inimicum Quicquid id est, per eum
desinit esse."
Coke says that he "Is called cancellarius, a cancellando, i. a digniori
parte,being the highest point of his jurisdiction to cancell the kings letters
patents under the great seale, and damming the inrolment thereof, by drawing
strikes through it like a lettice." (Inst. IV, 88.)
An eminent legal antiquary deduces the term from another source. "Commonly they
named the Place where the Writing was dated, and sometimes who wrote it; for
every Man might not be a Chancellor, as publique Scriveners were then termed;
And whereupon the Word Cancellare was used for Scribere, according to an old
Verse,
'Cancello, scribo: Cancello, grammata findo:
Cancelloque meas in cruce pono manus, Cancellois to write, or to deface;
Or like a Crosse, when as our Hands we place.'"
 (Spelman, English Works, Page 235.)
Fleta, in describing the Court of Chancery, states that it should be presided
over by a prudent and astute bishop or other ecclesiastic of high rank, to whom
all the other dignitaries of the Church are subordinated. "Est inter caetera
quoddam officium quod dicitur Cancellaria, quod viro provido & discreto, ut
Episcope vel clerico magnae dignitatis debet committi, simul cum cum majoris
sigilli regni, cuius substituti sunt cancellarii omnes in Anglia, Hibernia,
Wallia, & Scotia." (Commentarius Juris Anglicani, Cap.13.)
The chancery was not, at first, a judicial tribunal, as it is to-day. It was
rather the office of a secretary of state, wherein were employed a large number
of inferior officials who transacted its business. The original writs, of which
we read so often, were usually issued upon application, and were frequently
obtained through favoritism. Equity jurisdiction was not yet separated from
that of the law. Fleta is the first legal writer to refer to the King's
chancery as a court; before, however, it had, in reality, become one, "Habet
etiam curiam in Cancellaria sua & in diversis locis hospitii sui." (Ibid.,
Cap.2.) (VidePollock and Maitland, The History of English Law I, VII.)
The chancery no longer exists as a separate tribunal in England, but now
constitutes one of the five divisions of the High Court of Justice. (Wilson's
Practice of the Supreme Court of Judicature, Page 31.)
The last chancellor of the ecclesiastical order was John Williams, Archbishop
of York, 1621-1625.
In Scotland, the office of this high judicial dignitary was abolished at the
time of the Union. The foreman of a jury in that country is now called its
chancellor. (Peterson, A Compendium of English and Scotch Law, Page 496.)  ED.
7. The Same to Eustachius, Praetorian Prefect.
When assessors, who are sons under paternal control, have been accustomed to
aid their superior officials with their advice, and have been able to acquire
anything by lawful and honorable means, they can claim it as castrense
peculium,even after the death of their fathers.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of
Honorius, Consul for the thirteenth time, and Theodosius, Consul for the tenth
time, 422.
8. The Same to Asclepiodotus, Praetorian Prefect.
No judge shall presume to take anyone with him to the province whose
jurisdiction has been entrusted to him in order to invest him with the title of
bailiff, or chancellor; nor shall he induce anyone to come to him from any
place whatsoever for this purpose, lest he be branded with infamy, and have his
property confiscated; for We order that chancellors shall be selected on the
responsibility of, and after investigation by chief officials, so that after
their terms of office have expired they may not depart, but remain in the
province, in order that the opportunity to accuse them may be furnished those
who desire to do so; for if the case should demand it, they must be subjected
to torture for the purpose of detecting the crimes of the judge.
Given on the day before the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of
Asclepiodotus and Marinianus, 423.
9. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Taurus.
If, after their term of office has expired, the complaints of the people of the
province or of the curiae,or any other public necessity should demand the
presence of the judges, or the production of their bailiffs, they shall be
given up to the court and the laws, by the same officials whose attendants they
were.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifth of the Nonesof July, during the Consulate
of Theodosius, Consul for the fourteenth time, and Maximus, 433.
10. The Same to Florentius, Praetorian Prefect.
With reference to consular rulers who, in opposition to ancient laws and the
Imperial decrees, remain in office longer than four months under their
superiors, We order that they shall be liable to confiscation of their
property, and accusation of public crime, unless they can defend themselves by
means of a rescript, or an order issued by your tribunal.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of
Theodosius, Consul for the seventeenth time, and Festus, 439.
11. The Same to Zoilus, Praetorian Prefect of the East.
The liberality of Our benevolence must be manifested none the less towards the
assessors of the higher magistrates than towards the judges themselves; and
therefore We order that the counsellors of
illustrious officials, not only of the Praetorian Prefects of this Renowned City
and the distinguished commanders of the army, but also of the Masters of the
Offices, whether they have already performed the duties of said employment, or
expect to perform them hereafter, when their terms have expired, shall be
relieved of all taxes; and We order that every civil or military judge shall
hereafter be entirely immune from the same; and in order that you may suffer no
annoyance from this source, your office shall be fined fifty pounds of gold if
it permits anything to be done contrary to this Our law.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Theodosius,
Consul for the eighteenth time, and Albinus, 444.
12. The Emperors Valentinicm and Martian to Palladius, Praetorian Prefect.
All eminent judges shall be allowed to appoint the same counsellors for
themselves a second and a third time, and even more frequently; because what
once has been recognized as just should not, for this reason alone, be
disapproved.
13. The Emperor Justinian to Demosthenes, Praetorian Prefect.
No one of those who is, or has been appointed an advocate to conduct cases
either in this Royal City or in any court in one of the provinces subject to
Our Empire, shall presume at one and the same time to practice as advocate, and
discharge the functions of counsellor of any magistrate, to whom the conduct of
public affairs has been entrusted; as, in order for the duties of an advocate
or an assessor to be thoroughly performed it is abundantly sufficient to have
those of each office done by one person, lest if anyone should apply himself to
both he may discharge those of neither in a proper manner. If, however, the
party in question prefers to act as advocate, he can do so with the requisite
skill, and if he selects the office of assessor, he should confine himself to
it; so that, after having laid aside the office of counsellor, he can resume
the employment of advocate.
(1) Nor shall anyone be permitted to act as the assessor of two magistrates,
and perform the duties of both offices at the same time (for it cannot easily
be believed that one man is able to properly discharge the duties of two
different necessary employments; for when he is assisting one judge, he must
necessarily be absent from the other, and this will not be entirely
satisfactory to both), but where one office is entirely taken from him he
should be content with being attached to a single magistrate.
(2) And let no one think that this law can be evaded by any cunning devices,
as, for instance, instead of placing the signature of the counsellor at the end
of documents, as is customary, a person may imitate another signature, thinking
that he can discharge the duties of the above-mentioned office, and conceal
himself under the shadow of a fraud of this kind; as all those who attempt to
evade the law and its force by cunning and unscrupulous arts are guilty of its
violation.
And let no one flatter himself that he can evade the present law, as has been
the case with former ones enacted with reference to this subject. For if anyone
should be convicted of such an offence, he is hereby notified that his name
shall be immediately erased from the roll of advocates, and that he shall be
sentenced to pay a fine of ten pounds of gold into the Treasury of Our Private
Largesses, which penalty shall be exacted by the Illustrious Count of Private
Affairs; and he shall even be liable to a more severe one, nor shall the judge
himself who permitted this to be done, and acted knowingly and deliberately, go
unpunished. The same penalty shall be inflicted upon the person or persons who,
being either assessors or magistrates, have presumed to render judgment in
cases in which they have appeared as advocates; lest the remembrance of their
friendly disposition, or of their assistance as advocates, may not permit them
to sustain the part of an incorruptible judge.
Given at Chalcedon, on the fifth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate
of Decius, Consul for the fifth time, 529.
TITLE LII.
CONCERNING PROVISIONS AND THE CAPITATIONS OF CERTAIN OFFICIALS AND THEIR
ASSESSORS, AND OF THOSE EXERCISING OTHER PUBLIC EMPLOYMENTS, OR WHO HAVE BEEN
APPOINTED TO OFFICE.
1. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Florentinus, Pretoria/n Prefect.
An established and positive rule must be observed with reference to all eminent
officials, as well as illustrious judges who administer military or civil
affairs in the province, including the Count of Commerce, the Master of the
Mint, and the Treasurer of Private Affairs, of the district of Pontus, and
Asia; as well as the assessors of the judges, in the payment of their
allowances for provisions and capitations, so that they may obtain from these
sources that to which by their rank they are entitled, which is ordinarily
stated in their commissions.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Kalendsof June, during the
Consulate of Theodosius, Consul for the seventeenth time, and Festus, 439.
TITLE LIII.
CONCERNING THE CONTRACTS OF JUDGES AND THEIR SUBORDINATES, AND THE PROHIBITION
OF DONATIONS TO THEM, AND THE PROVISION THAT, DURING THEIR TERM OF OFFICE, THEY
CANNOT BUILD HOUSES OF THEIR OWN WITHOUT A PRAGMATIC SANCTION.
1. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Praetorian Prefect.Those who administer
public affairs in this Most Flourishing City cannot purchase any movable or
immovable property, or build any
houses without obtaining from Us a special rescript authorizing them to do so.
(1) Moreover, they must refuse donations of every description, knowing that
they are not valid, no matter what they may consist of, and what their value
is, unless the donor specially ratifies the donation in writing, after the term
of office of the person who received the gift has expired, or the term of five
years has elapsed, during which no complaint has been made with reference to
the said donation, either by the donor himself or by his successors.
(2) We absolutely forbid Governors of provinces not only to receive donations,
but also to make purchases of any property either movable or immovable (except
such as may be required for food and clothing), or to construct houses, even
though they may be authorized to do any of these things by a rescript; and
anything which has been given or transferred to them by sale shall not be
ratified, even though the term of five years may have passed from the time they
surrendered their office, and the consent of the donor or vendor may have been
obtained after the said term of office has expired.
(3) We consider it necessary for this rule also to apply to their bailiffs and
counsellors, adding that none of these acts can be performed through the
intervention of a third party without involving the risk of punishment.
(4) We order that this law shall have a retroactive effect, except where
matters have been settled by a compromise, or a judgment.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifth of the Idesof December, during the
Consulate of Our Lord Justinian, Consul for the second time.
TITLE LIV.
CONCERNING THE MANNER IN WHICH FINES SHALL BE IMPOSED BY JUDGES.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Firmus.
The imposition of a fine does not carry with it the stigma of infamy. Given on
the fifth of the Ides of April, during the Consulate of Antoninus and Geta,
Consuls for the second time, 206.
2. The Emperor Alexander to Decimius, Praetorian Prefect.
It has often been stated in rescripts that My agents, or receivers of public
money, have no right to impose fines.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of
Modestus and Probus, 229.
3. The Emperor Gordian to Celer, Praetorian Prefect.
The Curator of the Government, styled in Greek logista,has no right to impose a
fine.
Given during the Idesof September, during the Consulate of Gordian and Aviola,
240.
4. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Eutropius, Praetorian
Prefect.
We have authorized the illustrious Praetorian Prefect to impose a fine not to
exceed fifty pounds of gold, when the offence is an exceedingly serious one.
Given on the eighth of the Idesof January, during the Consulate of Gratian and
Theodosius, 380.
5. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Praetextatus, Praetorian
Prefect.
There is no one who does not know that the exact amount of fines received must
be turned over to Our Treasury; unless the judge has specially allotted the
fine paid for the commission of an offence, either to the public works, the
public race-course, or to other necessary objects.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof September, during the Consulate of Richomer
and Clearchus, 384.
6. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Messala, Praetorian Prefect.
We do not allow the ordinary Governors of provinces to impose a fine of more
than two ounces of gold upon such persons as have rendered themselves liable to
a pecuniary penalty.
(1) Where a fine is prescribed, the Proconsul shall have authority to impose
one of six ounces of gold, and this rule also applies to the Count of the East,
as well as to the Augustal Prefect.
(2) Other judges, and those who have undertaken the administration of military
affairs in Our stead, are notified that they are refused permission to impose a
fine of more than three ounces of gold.
(3) We decree that it shall be observed by judges that, when the repetition of
an offence demands it, the same person may be fined three times during the same
year, in accordance with the above-established scale.
(4) If any one should exceed the amounts above mentioned, he shall be condemned
to twofold restitution, and shall be required to pay into Our Treasury the sum
which he imposed under the name of a fine.
(5) Those who have been convicted of peculation or robbery, that is to say, of
depredation, corruption, or other crimes which ought to be punished with
exemplary severity, must not think that they are entitled to the moderate
penalties of the present law. Sentence shall always be passed by the above-
mentioned judges, after having been committed to writing, and at the expense of
the party against whom it is directed.
(6) Nor shall they think that they have a right to condemn anyone not guilty of
a serious offence with too great readiness, or precipitation; or that what they
have ordered can be changed by the mere will of the judge, unless the poverty
of the person who has been convicted induces him to do so.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of
Theodosius, Consul for the second time, and Cynegius, 388.
TITLE LV. CONCERNING THE DEFENDERS OF CITIES.
1. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Seneca, Defender.
If anyone thinks that you should be consulted with reference to trifling and
unimportant matters, that is to say, those in which an amount under fifty
solidiis involved, in other words, where anyone demands that you, by your
decree, collect for him a debt which is due, or restore a slave who has escaped
by flight, or any other thing of this kind, he may then institute proceedings
before you; other cases, however, which appear worthy of a higher tribunal
should be sent to the ordinary Governor of the province.
Given on the ^fifteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Valentinian and Valens, 365.
2. The Same to Probus, Praetorian Prefect.
The defenders of cities shall not be appointed from the classes of decurions or
attendants of public functionaries, but from other persons qualified for the
duties of the office.
Given on the third of the Nonesof November, during the same Consulate, 365.
3. The Same and Gratian to the Senate.
It has seemed to be reasonable that innocence and rustic quiet should enjoy the
benefit of protection; that is to say, be entitled to the services of the
public defender of the district, and have the power to appear before him in
pecuniary cases.
Given on the fourth of the Idesof August, during the second Consulate of
Valentinian and Valens, 368.
4. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Theodore, Defender.
The following rule must be observed, as well as the term of five years by
defenders of all provinces, that is to say you must, in the first place, act as
the father of the people, and not suffer the residents of either the country or
the town to be subjected to too heavy charges; and you must always oppose the
insolence of officials, and the arrogance of judges (showing them, however, the
respect to which they are entitled), and you shall have the power of appearing
before them whenever you may wish; but you must prevent persons from exacting
excessive damages or demanding more than they ought from them whom you should
regard in the place of children; and you shall not permit anything over and
above their dues to be collected from them, as it is certain that they cannot
be protected except by a remedy of this kind.
Given at Constantinople, on the eleventh of the Nonesof January, during the
Consulate of Arcadius and Bauto, 385.
5. The Emperors Valentinian, Arcadius, and Theodosius, to Potamius, Augustal
Prefect.
Defenders shall claim nothing for themselves in an insolent manner, nor
anything to which they are not entitled, and they can only discharge the duties
of their office in their own names; they cannot inflict penalties or severe
torture; and they must protect the people as well as the decurions from the
insolence and rashness of wicked persons, so that they may not fail to be what
their name implies.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Nonesof March, during the second
Consulate of Arcadius and Rufinus, 332.
6. The Same to Tatian, Praetorian Prefect.
Defenders of well-approved and resolute character shall be appointed in all
those regions in which the ferocious and reckless madness of robbers is
displayed; and they must exercise supervision over all daily occurrences, and
not permit crimes to go unpunished, but remove all persons who, by favoring
criminals, and by affording encouragement to wicked persons, permit offences to
be perpetrated.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof April, during the Consulate of Arcadius,
Consul for the second time, and Rufinus, 392.
7. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Caecilianus, Praetorian Prefect.
When persons are accused of robbery or violence, or have committed homicide, or
rape, and have been arrested and brought before the defenders, if the crime
should be proved by those who have made the accusation, they shall immediately
send the culprits under a suitable guard before the judges.
Given at Ravenna, on the twelfth of the Kalendsof February, during the
Consulate of Honorius, Consul for the eighth time, and Theodosius, Consul for
the third time, 405.
8. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Caecilius, Praetorian Prefect.
We order that municipal defenders shall be chosen from those who have been
initiated into the sacred mysteries of the orthodox religion, and appointed by
a decree of the Most Reverend Bishops, clerks, persons of honorable rank,
possessors of property and curiae.The selection shall be referred to the
illustrious Praetorian Prefect, in order that the appointment may be confirmed
by him in writing.
(1) If, however, the defenders should ascertain that anything has been done by
any person whomsoever against the public welfare, and to the injury of
possessors of property, they are hereby authorized to notify the illustrious
and eminent Praetorian Prefect, and the illustrious commanders of cavalry and
infantry, as well as the Masters of the Offices and the Counts of the Imperial
Largesses, as well as those of Private Affairs.
Given at Ravenna, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof February, during the
Consulate of Honorius, Consul for the eighth time, and Theodosius, Consul for
the third time, 409.
9. The Same to Caecilius, Praetorian Prefect.
We order defenders, by the exercise of care and vigilance, to prevent owners of
property from being oppressed by collectors of taxes, through the use of
excessive measures and weights, and if the latter should be detected, they
shall be sent to the judges with the evidence of the fraud which they have
committed.
(1) Whenever Our provincial subjects are refused by defenders the right to
claim damages from those who have injured them, if they desire to do so,
permission shall be granted them to draw up their own complaints at the time
when the case is to be heard, and to present them publicly in the most
frequented places in the cities, and to notify the scribes, notaries, and other
public officials, by whom their complaints should be received; so that in spite
of the above-mentioned persons, proceedings may be instituted against those who
are guilty, and the good faith of the complaints may be examined, and if it
should be found to be proper, the power of the judges shall be vigorously
exerted against those who refused to receive the complaints.
Given at Ravenna, on the eleventh of the Kalendsof February, under the
Consulate of Honorius, Consul for the eighth time, and Theodosius, Consul for
the third time, 409.
10. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Cyrus, Praetorian Prefect.

Governors of provinces, as well as upon judges or others who dare to violate
Our Sacred Decree.
Given on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof September, under the Consulate of
Constantine and Cyrus, 441.

1. The Emperor Constantine to Florentius, Praetorian Prefect.
Decurions should be appointed to discharge the duties of magistrates, or for
the collection of provisions, three months or more before the terms of their

replace them without causing any inconvenience.
Given at Constantinople, on the Idesof April, during the Consulate of Severus
and Rufinus, 323.
2. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Germanianus.
Municipal magistrates shall have the power to draw up public decrees.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of Our
Emperor Gratian, and Dagalaiphus, 366.

been presented before the Governor of a province, a municipal magistrate, or a
defender of the people.






THE CODE OF OUR LORD, THE MOST HOLY EMPEROR JUSTINIAN.
SECOND EDITION.


BOOK II.

TITLE I. CONCERNING THE BRINGING OF AN ACTION.
1. The Emperor Antoninus Pius to Æmilius.
You, yourself, must ascertain the proof necessary to establish the fact that
you are entitled to the money which you allege you have deposited, for your
demand that your adversary produce his accounts cannot be conceded; as to order
this is the exclusive duty of the judge, after proper cause has been shown.
Given on the fourth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of Sabinus,
Consul for the second time, and Severus, 156.
2. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Faustus.
He before whom proceedings are brought shall order public documents, both civil
and criminal, to be produced, for the purpose of being examined, in order to
ascertain the truth.
Given on the Nonesof July, during the Consulate of Severus and Albinus, 193.
3. The Same to Valens.
An action having been begun only presents the image of the future proceeding,
as it can either be amended or changed in accordance with the authority of the
Perpetual Edict, or when equity permits the court to grant it.
Given on the second of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of
Severus, Consul for the third time, and Antoninus, 203.
4. The Emperor Antoninus to Epaphroditus.
Persons who wish to bring an accusation must have the evidence, for neither law
nor equity permits that power be granted to inspect the documents of the other
side. Therefore, if the plaintiff does not prove his allegations, the defendant
shall be discharged, even if he himself furnishes no evidence.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of the two Aspers,
223.
5. The Emperor Alexander to Valentiniana.
It is not new for a party from whom money is demanded in a suit to ask that the
accounts of his creditor be produced, in order to establish the truth of the
claim.
Given on the seventh of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and Ælianus, 224.
6. The Same to Uranius.
It is but just that the request of. him, against whom an action to collect
money is brought, should be granted to permit him to examine the public
records, after their production, so as to ascertain how much has been paid in
his name, even where the Government is plaintiff.
Given on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of
Maximus, Consul for the second time, and Ælianus, 224.
7. The Same to Valens.
The Agent of Our Private Affairs shall, as is customary, order that you be
given authority to take copies of instruments in which you say both you and the
Treasury are interested; and if the case should require any of them to be
proved before another judge in order to establish the truth of your claim, and
the party against whom the action is brought desires that the originals be
produced, the Agent aforesaid shall order this to be done.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof March, under the Consulate of Fuscus and
Dexter, 226.
Extract from Novel 119, Chapter HI. Latin Text.
Where anyone in one document refers to another, no attention ought to be paid
to this unless the document alluded to in the second one is produced, or some
other evidence of the amount of the debt is given, because the original sum of
which mention is made is considered to be correct. This rule is found in the
ancient laws.
8. The Same to Florus.
The Rescripts published by the Divine Antoninus, My Father, and Myself, conform
to the principles of law and equity, as they are not different from, or
contrary to one another; for a great distinction exists between a party who
brings an action for a claim, who can be barred from recovery by an exception
on the ground of fraud, when the defendant desires accounts to be produced by
which he alleges that he can protect himself, which the justice of the case
itself requires; and where the plaintiff demands evidence to be produced by the
party who is sued for the claim, when, in this instance, it is not proper that
the prayer of the petition should be established by instruments belonging to
him against whom suit was brought.
Given during the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of Fuscus and Dexter,
226.
TITLE II. CONCERNING THE SUMMONS TO COURT.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Trophinius.
The rules of ordinary courtesy demand that respect be shown by a freedman to
the wife of the person who manumitted him; hence he is forbidden to summon her
to court, even when this is necessary, without obtaining the consent of the
Praetor.
Given on the fourth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Agricola
and Clamentinus, 231.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Nocturnus.
The law is perfectly clear on the point that where the benefit of the Edict is
not invoked, a patron or a patroness, their parents, their children, and also
their heirs, even if they are strangers, cannot be summoned to court by their
freedmen, or the children of the latter; nor in a case of this kind can
ignorance be alleged as an excuse, since in accordance with natural reason,
honor is due to persons of this description. Therefore, when you acknowledge
that you have summoned the son of your patron to court without previously
obtaining the permission of the Governor, you will, in vain, ask to be exempted
from the penalty prescribed by the Perpetual Edict by virtue of a rescript
which has been given you.
Given on the eighth of the Idesof November, during the Consulate of Gordian and
Aviola, 240.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Rosana.
Persons who are under the control of their fathers cannot bring suit against
them. But, if you have been emancipated, you will not be forbidden to do so,
provided you have claimed the benefit of the Edict; and this rule also applies
to the mother.
Given on the eighth of the Idesof November, during the Consulate of Diocletian,
Consul for the second time, and Maximian, 287.





TITLE III. CONCERNING INFORMAL AGREEMENTS.

1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Philinus.
The uncertainty of a condition can be terminated between two brothers by an
equitable agreement. Therefore, when you allege that, by the terms of a trust,
if your father should die without issue, he will leave his share of the estate
to Licinius Fronto; the agreement with reference to the sixth part of the
estate being given to the said Licinius Fronto, which was made at the time when
Philinus had no children, will not, for that reason, appear to be unjust,
because after the division had been made, as was intended, he died leaving you
his son.
Given on the seventh of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of
Severus, Consul for the second time, and Victorinus, 204.

2. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Claudius.
If, after the sale of the estate has been made by you, you can prove that the
creditors of said estate have brought suit against the purchasers, and the
latter have voluntarily undertaken the defence, you can then very properly
protect yourself on the ground of an implied agreement.

3. The Same to Restitutus.
The slave of a creditor can improve the condition of his master, but he cannot,
by means of a new agreement, render an obligation already legally contracted
disadvantageous.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Severus,
Consul for the third time, and Antoninus, 203.

4. The Same to Valeria.
After you have abandoned an action brought with reference to a tract of land,
no reason will permit you to revive it after it has once been disposed of:
Given on the fourth of the Idesof February, during the Consulate of Albinus and
Æmilianus, 207.

5. The Emperor Antoninus to Demagoras.
When you have paid your creditor a part of the debt, and it has been informally
agreed between you and him that he will not demand the remainder, on account of
your defence of his affairs, undertaken in good faith with your support, you
will be released from this obligation, partly by the Civil, and partly by the
praetorian law, for a perpetual exception based on an informal agreement, or on
the ground of had faith, will bar the collection of the remainder, as whatever
has been paid through ignorance can be recovered.
Given at Rome, on the eighth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of
Antoninus, Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.

6. The Same to Basilia.
It is an undoubted legal rule that informal agreements made contrary to the
laws and constitutions, or against good morals, have no force or effect
whatever.
Given on the Kalendsof August, during the same Consulate, 214.

7. The Same to Julius Maximus.
If you become the heir of your debtor, the action against him to which you are
entitled will be extinguished by merger, as soon as you enter upon the estate.
If, however, after you have obtained the estate in court, you should deliver it
to the party against whom you have obtained the judgment, under the condition
and agreement that if you do not accept the estate, he shall satisfy the other
creditors, as well as yourself, for what is due to you; a contract of this kind
must be observed, and if this is not done, an action based on the stipulation
will be granted, provided an agreement was made; or the action prescriptis
verbiswill lie, if no stipulation was entered into.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Antoninus,
Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.

8. The Same to Mucatraulius.
Where flocks are taken to be pastured on shares, that is to say, when it is
agreed by the parties that their increase shall be divided between the owner
and the shepherd, and it is proved that Apollinaris agreed to the contract, he
can be compelled by the judge to execute it.
Given on the fourth of the Kalendsof October, under the Consulate of Alexander
and Marcellus, 227.

9. The Emperor Alexander to Dionysius.
After your mother's adversary has lost his case, and has taken advantage of her
by making her furnish security that she will not raise any controversy with
reference to slaves, this agreement having been made in bad faith, is void. And
when he brings an action based on this agreement against your mother, the judge
must release her from liability.
Given on the day before the Idesof September, during the Consulate of
Alexander, Consul for the second time, and Marcellus, 227.

10. The Same to Nicas.
The condition which you prescribe when you give a dowry for your foster-
daughter must be observed; and the common statement that a right of action does
not arise from an informal agreement cannot be employed against you; for We
make use of this rule when the contract has no consideration; otherwise, when
money is given, and anything is agreed upon as to its repayment, a personal
action for its recovery will lie.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Albinus and
Maximus, 227.

11. The Same to Capito.
You allege that an agreement was made between your father and your stepmother,
at the time when she gave a tract of land as a dowry, to the effect that she
would pay the interest to the creditors to whom the land was hypothecated. You
cannot bring suit against her, even though it may be proved that the agreement
was made a part of the stipulation. If, however, a tract of land, which has
been appraised, is given by way of dowry (and this appears in the instrument),
an action on sale will lie, in order that the agreement may be carried out.
Given on the Nonesof December, during the Consulate of Alexander, Consul for
the third time, and Dio, Consul for the second time, 230.

12. The Same to Flacilla.
Law, as well as equity, requires that the most recent informal agreements shall
be observed; for which reason, if, by a prior agreement consent was given that
the claim should not bear interest, and especially if (as you propose), the
parties made the same statement before the Governor, you will not be forbidden
to bring the action to which you would have been entitled under the first
agreement.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Agricola and
Clement, 231. .

13. The Emperor Maximin to Marius.
In bona fidecontracts, an action on an informal agreement will only lie when
the agreement was made at the same time; for if it was made afterwards it will
not give rise to an action, but to an exception.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof January, during the Consulate of Maximin and
Africanus, 237.

14. The Emperor Gordian to the Soldier Clius.
If a stipulation was added to the agreement under which you allege that your
adversary promised to pay a certain sum by way of penalty if he did not abide
by it, you can, by virtue of the stipulation, compel him to do what is included
in the agreement, or you can, in the usual way, exact the penalty provided by
the stipulation; as, without observing the ordinary legal formalities, you will
in vain demand that the property of your adversary be transferred to you.
Given on the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Gordian, Consul for the
second time, and Pompeianus, 242.

15. The Emperors Valentinian and Gallienus, and the Caesar Valerian to
Pactumeius.
The agreement included in the dotal instrument, namely, that if the father
should die, the daughter who was to be married should, with her brother, be
heirs to equal portions of the estate, gives rise to no obligation, and does
not deprive the father of the woman of the power to make a will.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Æmilianus
and Bassus, 267.

16. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Diaphantus.
When you allege that sons who have been appointed testamentary heirs are so
charged that the one who dies first must transfer to the other his share of the
estate, and as you assert that this precarious substitution of the brothers has
been abandoned by common consent, the reason for the execution of the trust no
longer exists.
Given on the third of the Idesof February, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and Acquilinus, 286.

17. The Same to Deximachus.
The Governor of a province shall cause an agreement, which is shown to have
been made in good faith, to be executed according to law, even if it has not
been committed to writing; when the truth of the transaction can be established
by other evidence.
Given on the ninth of the Kalends of July, during the above-mentioned
Consulate, 287.

18. The Same to Julius and Æmilius.
If you prove that your creditors have permitted one of your co-debtors to pay a
portion of the debt in his own behalf, the Governor of the province shall, in
accordance with his dignity, see that neither party is sued for the
indebtedness of the other.
Given on the seventh of the Idesof January, during the Consulate of Diocletian,
Consul for the third time, and Maximian, 287.

19. The Same to the Soldier, Victorian.
Although a document drawn up between private persons, which provides that the
survivor shall obtain the property of the other, does not present the
appearance of a donation mortis causa,still, as the testament of a soldier,
disposing of his estate, and reduced to writing during his last moments, in
anticipation of death, has all the force of a last will; and you state that
your brother and yourself, being about to go into battle, made a reciprocal
agreement in view of the common fortune of death, in such a manner that the
property of him who died first should belong to the survivor; and the condition
having been complied with, it is understood that, by the will of your brother
(which rule is confirmed by the Imperial Constitutions), his entire property is
transferred to you.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of
Diocletian, Consul for the fifteenth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third
time.

20. The Same to Martial.
The ownership of property is transferred by delivery and usucaption, and not by
informal agreements without consideration.
Given on the Kalendsof January, during the fifth and fourth Consulates of the
Same Consuls, respectively, 293.

21. The Same Emperors, and the Caesars, to Eusebius.When you state that it was
agreed between you, without having been committed to writing, that the
inheritances of your brothers should
be divided into equal shares, and that it can be proved by the form of the
transaction that this agreement was actually made, you can protect yourself by
an exception, if you have possession of the property.
When, however, your adversary has possession, you must understand that no right
of action will arise from such an agreement, if you did not provide for it by a
stipulation, and your adversary will not be permitted to avail himself of the
transaction, unless he is ready to carry out what was agreed upon.
Given on the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Faustus, Consul for the
second time, and Gallus, 298.

22. The Same Emperors, and the Caesars, to Archelaus.
The agreement of a curator to accept a smaller amount than is due does not have
the effect of injuring a minor of adult age, for guardians and curators, in
collecting what is due to their wards or minors, cannot release the debtor from
his obligation, even if they remit the debt.
Given on the eighteenth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the
same Emperors; the first, Consul for the seventh time, and the second, Consul
for the sixth time, 299.

23. The Same, and the Caesars, to Honoratus.
A son, by entering into an agreement, or accepting payment of a debt, does not
diminish the obligation due to his father.
Given on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the
same Emperors; the first, Consul for the seventh time, and the second, Consul
for the sixth time, 299.

24. The Same, and the Caesars, to Domina.
If you have a right of action growing out of a legacy or a trust against the
heirs of your former husband, and it is proved that you have relinquished it in
favor of others of the heirs, understand that where you bring suit against the
debtors, an exception based on the agreement cannot prejudice you in any way.
Given on the seventh of the Kalendsof January, during the third Consulate of
the Caesars, 300.

25. The Same, and the Caesars, to Euthemerus.
The rights of creditors cannot be extinguished or altered by agreements made by
their debtors with one another.
Given on the fourth of the Kalendsof May, during the third Consulate of the
Caesars, 300.

26. The Same, and the Caesars, to Cornelia.
Under the Law of the Twelve Tables, an agreement entered into by the heirs of a
debtor by which the indebtedness of the estate was divided in proportion to the
shares cannot bind one of the debtors to the creditor for the entire amount,
and this also takes place where the heirs succeed under the praetorian law;
hence, you can, so far as
your interest is involved, bring an action against one of the co-heirs for the
production of their common acknowledgment of the indebtedness in writing, or to
establish the fact that no agreement for such an appointment was made.
Given on the third of the Idesof October, during the Consulate of the Caesars.

27. The Same, and the Caesars, to Aurelius Chresimus.
Anyone who brings suit under a stipulation which has been added in order to
insure the execution of a contract, whether an informal agreement was made
previously, or immediately afterwards, demands that a decision be rendered in
accordance with the provisions of the latter.
Given at Heraclea, on the sixth of the Idesof November, during the Consulate of
the Caesars.

28. The Same, and the Caesars, to Leontius.
Where money has been paid for some years under an agreement without
consideration, he who made payment cannot afterwards compel the other party to
refund what was received on the ground of its not having been due, unless a
stipulation to that effect has been added.
Given on the third of the Nonesof December, during the Consulate of the same
Emperors; the first, Consul for the eighth time, and the second, Consul for the
second time.

29. The Emperor Justinian to John, Praetorian Prefect.
Where anyone, when drawing up an instrument, states that he will not avail
himself of any exception to which he is entitled on account of his military
rank, his dignity, or his prerogative as a member of the priesthood, although
it formerly might have been doubted whether it was necessary to comply with
this agreement, if the person who made it did not repudiate it, or whether he
had the power to violate it and exercise his right, We order that no one shall
be permitted to repudiate his written agreement and deceive the contracting
parties, for it is provided by the Edict of the Praetor himself that informal
agreements which are not contrary to law, or which have been entered into with
fraudulent intent, must, under all circumstances, be observed; wherefore would
not such agreements be valid in this instance, as there is another rule of
ancient law which provides that all persons have the right to repudiate
anything which has been done for their benefit. Hence, all Our judges must
observe this rule in litigation, and it applies to ordinary judges of inferior
jurisdiction,[[1]]

[[1]] These were special, permanent deputy judges (judices delegati),to whom were
assigned the decision of unimportant matters, or the ascertainment of the facts
of a case, by magistrates of superior jurisdiction. The name was derived from
the fact that they, as it were, sat at the feet of the court (quasi ad pedes
praetoris).
The judices pedaneiof later times constituted an important branch of the
Byzantine judiciary. They were twelve in number; were appointed from the ranks
of the aristocracy and from those members of the profession most distinguished
to mediators and to arbitrators, and they are notified that if they fail to
comply with it, they shall be understood to have made the case their own.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof September, after the Consulate of
Lampadius and Orestes, 331.


30. The Same to John, Praetorian Prefect.
We have been asked the following question by the Bar of Caesarea: "Two or more
persons expected to receive an estate, either on account of their relationship,
or because of informal agreements entered into between them with reference to
the said estate, in which agreements it was expressly stated that if the owner
of it should die, and the estate should go to them, certain arrangements should
be made concerning the same; or if any of said persons should receive any
particular benefit from the estate, certain provisions were to be carried out;
and a doubt arose whether agreements of this kind should be observed."
The difficulty arises from the fact that the agreement had been entered into
while the owner of the estate was still alive, because agreements of this kind
are not based upon the fact that the parties are, under all circumstances,
certain to receive the estate, but are dependent upon two conditions; namely,
that the owner of the same should die, and that those who made such an
agreement should be called to the succession.
All contracts of this kind, however, seem to Us to be abominable, and capable
of producing the saddest and most dangerous effects; for why should any persons
make an agreement concerning the property of a person who is still living, and
not be aware of what they have done ? Therefore, in accordance with the rules
of the ancients, We order that agreements of this kind, which are entered into
against good morals, shall be absolutely void, and that nothing in them shall
be observed, unless the person with reference to whose estate the agreement was
made gives his consent, and from that time to the end of his life remains of
the same kind. For, under these circumstances, all untimely expectations having
been removed, it will be lawful for the agreements to be carried out, as the
owner of the property is aware of, and consents to them.
This rule was not unknown to former laws and constitutions, but it has been
presented by Us in a clearer manner. For We order that neither donations of
such property, nor hypothecations of the same, shall be permitted under any
circumstances whatsoever, that no one shall make a contract for this purpose;
and also that after Our reign,
for their attainments and reputation, and took cognizance of questions of both
law and fact. Suits involving sums to the amount of three hundred solidi(about
$8,100, at the present value of money) were heard and decided by them, without
reducing the proceedings to writing.
Many eminent provincial lawyers, some of whom had already served in the
capacity of magistrates, were raised to this dignity. An appeal lay from this
tribunal either to that of the Emperor alone, or to officials appointed by him
for this purpose.  ED.

it shall not be permissible for anything to be done or contracted for with
reference to the estate of another, without his consent.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof November, after the Consulate of
Lampadius and Orestes, 531.





TITLE IV. CONCERNING COMPROMISES.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Celerius.
No agreement or compromise made with certain curators or guardians shall be of
any advantage to the others, so far as any property which they have, or should
have administered, either separately or conjointly, is concerned; and,
therefore, if you have three curators and compromise with two of them, you will
not be prevented from suing the third.
Given on the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Gentian and Bassus, 212.
2. The Same to Luctatius.
As you allege that you have made a settlement with your sister, with reference
to an estate, and that you have given security to her for a certain sum of
money that you owe her, although there is no dispute about the estate, still,
as you made the compromise through fear of a legal action, the debt is
understood to have been properly secured, and therefore if you pay the
Treasury, you cannot recover it; and if you do not do so, you can legally be
sued.
Given on the third of the Idesof August, during the Consulate of Antoninus,
Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
3. The Emperor Alexander to Tullia.
Bring an action against Geminian, on the ground that his father, who was
appointed your curator, transacted your business; and, if he should deny in
court that he is liable to this action, as a compromise and a stipulation was
affected under the Aquilian Law, the judge, in consideration of the decision
demanded in good faith, shall ascertain upon what sum of money the compromise
was based, and if it appears that this was done for a smaller amount than was
proved to be due as a balance under the administration of the curatorship, he
shall order him to pay it; for the reason that, according to the Aquilian
stipulation, none of the sum of money which was due can legally be deducted.
Given on the day before the Idesof August, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and Ælianus, 324.
4. The Same to Numidius.
Where an action under the Aquilian stipulation to compel the rendition of an
account of the administration of a curatorship has been brought by a party who
has become of lawful age, and the claim has
been extinguished by a release, the plaintiff cannot have recourse to any other
action, unless there is no doubt that fraud has been committed, unless a
compromise having special reference to the fraud was made.
Given on the second of the Nonesof March, during the Consulate of Alexander,
Consul for the second time, and Marcellus, 227.
5. The Same to Evocatus.
As you assert that you have compromised with the heir of your former guardian,
if you did so after arriving at your majority, you will in vain demand that the
contract be rescinded; for although (as you say), no instrument was drawn up,
still, as it is established by your statement that the contract was actually
made, the written instrument which usually contains the evidence of the
transaction is not necessary.
Given on the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Albinus and Æmilianus.
6. The Same to Pomponius.
As you allege that your mother, after having filed a complaint that the will
was inofficious, has compromised with some of the heirs, and agreed to accept a
portion of the estate and abandon the suit, the law will not permit you, as the
heir of your mother, to renew a complaint which she has abandoned; if, however,
the agreement was not carried out, you can properly sue a portion of the heirs
to the extent of the interest of each. For where a stipulation is attached to
an agreement, an action based on it will lie; or if the verbal obligation was
omitted, an equitable action to show that the transaction was concluded
praescriptis verbisshould be granted.
Given on the eighth of the Idesof January, during the Consulate of Agricola and
Clement, 231.
7. The Same to the Soldier Licinius.
An agreement for a compromise made by a person whom you directed to bring the
action, but not to enforce judgment, will not, in any way, prejudice your
claim.
Given on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Gordian and Aviola, 240.
8. The Emperor Gordian to the Soldier Junius.
When a question is raised with reference to support which has not been
provided, a compromise can be made; but one which involves future maintenance
is not considered to be of any legal force unless it has been authorized by
either the Praetor or the Governor.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof January, under the Consulate of Pius and
Pontianus, 239.
9. The Same to Agrippinus.
If suit for the possession of property is brought against you by your wife's
brother, and you defend it after having (as you allege),
made an agreement and a stipulation with him that if your adversary should,
within a specified time, pay you ten aurei,you will give him possession; or, if
he should not pay you the said sum, he cannot proceed further against you; and
he who makes such a promise does not comply with it, the result will be that
you, to whom the property belongs, ought not to suffer any violence from him;
and the illustrious Governor of the province, having been applied to on this
account, shall forbid force to be employed to your injury, and, above all, if
an action in remshould lie in favor of the adverse party, he can, under an
agreement of this kind, be barred by an equitable exception.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof April, during the Consulship of Gordian,
Consul for the second time, and Pompeianus, 242.
10. The Emperor Philip to Apollophania.
You will unjustly bring a complaint against the sons of your brother on account
of the estate of their father, and with reference to their condition, as this
is contrary to the ties of blood as well as to the faith of contracts, for
there would be no end to litigation, if bona fidecompromises could easily be
violated.
Given on the day before the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Peregrinus
and Æmilianus, 245.
11. The Emperors Valerian Gallienus, and the Noble Caesar Valerian, to the
Soldier Caianus.
The compromise made between your brother and yourself with reference to a trust
created by your father providing that if either of you should die without
issue, is valid; as it is mantained by the harmony existing between the
brothers, rendering it improbable that one of them should desire the death of
the other; and it cannot be rescinded on the ground that advantage has been
taken of you, as, under this agreement, you have given your promise not to
avail yourself of the age when it is customary for a person to be released from
his obligations; and, if you institute proceedings, you should not, for the
same reason, obtain the benefit of complete restitution.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of
Valerian and Gallienus, both Consuls for the second time, 256.
12. The Same to Primus.
The Governor of the province shall ascertain whether the compromise entered
into between you and the rulers of your city was made with reference to an
action whose issue was doubtful, or whether you have improperly obtained a
release for what should unquestionably be paid; and, in the former instance, he
shall order the compromise to stand, and in the latter, he must not allow it to
prejudice the rights of the city.
Given on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of
Æmilianus and Bassus, 260.
13. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Proba.
It is stated in the Perpetual Edict that a compromise effected through fear is
not valid; but it is not every kind of apprehension which is sufficient to
rescind those which have been made by consent, but the fear must be proved to
be such as threatens danger to life, or suffering to the body. The nature of
the principal cause is not, however, sufficient to prove violence or fraud;
hence if nothing of this kind can be established, it will, by no means, be
necessary for controversies which have been terminated to be renewed.
But, as you assert that the person with whom you have compromised is the son of
your female slave, and is your slave, if the facts stated in the petition are
true, another reason exists for declaring the agreement void; for there is no
doubt whatever that, under the law, masters who make agreements with their
slaves cannot be held liable under any such contracts.
Given at Byzantium, on the fourth of the Nonesof April, during the Consulate of
the same Emperors; the first, Consul for the fourth time, and the second,
Consul for the third time, 258.
14. The Same to Sopatra.
Where the adverse party brings suit to annul the contract, equity suggests that
if the money should be refunded (and you consent to it), the action can be
brought again.
Given on the fourth of the Nonesof July, during the Consulate of the same
Emperors; the first, Consul for the fourth time, and the second, Consul for the
third time, 290.
. 15. The Same to Pontius.
In order that you may receive a suitable reply, you should insert a copy of the
contract in your application, so that We may understand whether an ordinary
agreement has been made, or whether a stipulation under the Aquilian Law and a
release have been added; and if this has been done, it is clear that your
adversary is not entitled to bring suit to recover the estate, or claim any
special property.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof August, during the abovementioned
Consulate, 290.
16. The Same to Caecilius.
It is prohibited by an Imperial Rescript to revive any case or litigation which
has been terminated by lawful compromise.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof March, during the administration of the above-
mentioned Consuls; the first, Consul for the fifth time, and the second, Consul
for the fourth time, 293.
17. The Same Emperors and Caesars to Marcellus.
As you allege with reference to the person against whom you petition, and who
had a lawsuit with you, that she, after having received the property which you
agreed to give her for the purpose of putting an end to the matter in dispute,
now desires to repudiate the agree-
ment and you request that she either abide by it, or restore the property which
was given to her; examine whether you made provision that if she violated the
agreement, the property should be returned, but the compromise and the
stipulation should stand, if at that time she was over twenty-five years of
age; because, under these circumstances, you can interpose an exception based
on the agreement, and bring suit to recover the property which you have given;
but if nothing of this kind was agreed upon, you will be entitled to an
exception, but you will not have the right to recover the property which you
have given.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof June, during the above-mentioned Consulate,
293.
18. The Same, and the Caesars, to Valens.
It is not forbidden to compromise or make an agreement with reference to a
capital crime, with the exception of adultery; and in other public crimes which
do not involve the penalty of death no compromise can be made, except where an
accusation of forgery is made.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof September, under the abovementioned
Consulate, 293.
19. The Same, and the Caesars, to Irenaeus.
We do not permit a bona fidecompromise to be rescinded under the pretext of
subsequently discovered documentary evidence. When, however, it can be proved
that the decision of the case has been obtained by the concealment of
instruments necessary to establish the truth, either by the interested party
himself, or by another, if the action still remains, an exception based on
contract can be met by a reply alleging bad faith; but where it has already
been disposed of, you can only bring suit on the ground of fraud within the
time prescribed by law.
Given on the fourth of the Kalendsof October, under the abovementioned
Consulate, 393.
20. The Same, and the Caesars, to Antistia.
It is with good reason held that no less authority attaches to compromises than
to matters which have been judicially decided; and, indeed, nothing is so
agreeable to the good faith of human nature as for men to abide by the
agreements which they have entered into; and in order to rescind an agreement
it is not sufficient for you to state that it was made during the second hour
of the night, as no time authorizes the repudiation of consent by a person of
sound mind who has reached the age of twenty-five years.
Given on the fourth of the Kalendsof October, under the abovementioned
Consulate, 492.
21. The Same, and the Caesars, to Geminian.
It is ordered that those things which, under the terms of a compromise, it has
been agreed shall be given or retained, for example
where it has been determined to take as a purchaser a person who has been
deemed acceptable, any fictitious transaction being considered as not having
taken place, the demand for the payment of the imaginary price shall be made in
vain.
Given on the fifth of the Nonesof October, under the above-mentioned Consulate,
293.
22. The Same, and the Caesars, to Alexander.
If you make a compromise during your majority, an action based upon fraud will
not be sufficient to rescind it.
Given on the Kalendsof December during the above-mentioned Consulate, 293.
23. The Same, and the Caesars, to Tatian.
The institution of proceedings by the creditors of Archimedorus, to whom you
allege others have succeeded, will not affect you, if you were not liable for
him; but it is proper that the matter should be decided after a thorough
investigation, since, as you say that the dispute has already been settled by a
compromise, and that the sum of money agreed upon has been paid by you, you
will very improperly ask that you should be granted an action under the pretext
of having paid money which was not due; as, even if only a stipulation has been
entered into, you cannot defend yourself on the ground that you have promised
what was not due.
Given on the eighth of the Idesof March, under the Consulate of the Caesars,
294.
24. The Same, and the Caesars, to Victorvnus.
If, after having received whatever was mentioned in the instrument drawn up
with reference to the compromise, and it having been agreed that nothing more
should be demanded, you perceive that your adversary is defending herself by
means of an exception, you will by no means be prevented from collecting the
remainder of the debt, if she should be forced, without any judicial decision,
to pay a certain amount which she confessed that she owes.
Given at Sirmium, on the fifth of the Nonesof April, under the Consulate of the
Caesars, 294.
25. The Same Emperors and Caesars to Marcella and Quirilla.
If, after having attained the age of twenty-five years, you should make a
compromise with either your paternal or maternal uncle, and release to him
unconditionally what was due to you, as a donation, for the reason that you did
not allege that you made this agreement for the sake of obtaining the estate,
that is to say, with the expectation of a future inheritance, and others
succeed to him, the compromise having been terminated, you cannot dispute it.
Given on the second of the Idesof April, during the Consulate of the Caesars,
294.
26. The Same, and the Caesars, to Dionysiada.It is a well-known rule of law that
children cannot become slaves through any compromise made by their mother.
Given on the Idesof April, during the Consulate of the Caesars,
294.
27. The Same, and the Caesars, to Cato.
It is clear that anyone, who is of sound mind, even though he may be ill in
body, can legally make a compromise; and you should not, with unjust intention,
demand that the contract be rescinded under the pretext of corporeal in
disposition.
Given on the seventh of the Idesof May, under the Consulate of the Caesars, 294.
28. The Same, and the Caesars, to Saparita.
Whether the compromise in question was entered into, and recorded in the
registers of the Governor of the province, or whether this was not done, or
whether it was committed to writing or not, it is proper for it to be observed;
but, as you acknowledge that you agreed to receive something certain, even if
this was not committed to writing, and no stipulation with reference to it was
added, although a right of action does not arise from such an agreement, still,
if while the suit for the recovery of the property is pending an exception on
contract is opposed to you, you can, by making use of a reply based on fraud,
or in factum,force your adversary to comply with the agreement.
Given on the third of the Nonesof July, during the Consulate of the Caesars,
294.
29. The Same, and the Caesars, to Martia.
The laws forbid that after a general compromise has been effected, it should be
rescinded on the ground of newly discovered documentary evidence; but a mistake
with reference to the ownership of the property at the time that the compromise
was made can injure no one except the contracting parties.
Given on the fourth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 294.
30. The Same, and the Caesars, to Antoninus.
As you allege that after the compromise was effected more fraud had been
committed by you than by those against whom you filed your petition, it would
be injurious, as well as criminal, for you to revive the dispute.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof October, during the Consulate of
the Caesars, 294.
31. The Same, and the Caesars, to Proculus.
Where a compromise has been made with reference to certain property, and it was
agreed that nothing more should be demanded,
even though this may not have been inserted in the instrument, the right of
action will nevertheless remain unimpaired, so far as other matters are
concerned.
Given at Byzantium, on the fourth of the Idesof October, during the Consulate
of the Caesars.
32. The Same, and the Caesars, to Cyrillus.
Where, after proper cause has been shown, a decision is rendered (as prescribed
by law), it will not be suspended by taking an appeal, or by the formality of
complete restitution; and it is not at all uncertain that you have compromised
in vain with reference to the judgment; and hence, if a stipulation and release
have not been added under the Aquilian Law, you have extinguished the right of
action to which you were entitled, and the Governor of the province, in
accordance with legal procedure, shall see that the judgment previously
rendered is executed.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 294.
33. The Same, and the Caesars, to Euchrusius.
If it was provided by the terms of a compromise that you should be given a
certain tract of land defined by metes and bounds, instead of another tract
which you claimed, and at that time you were over twenty-five years of age;
although it may be proved that the said tract of land had subsequently been
encumbered, or partly belonged to someone else, the law forbids the case to be
revived, after it has once been decided. You can, indeed, bring suit under the
stipulation, if one was attached to the agreement, or if not, you can bring the
civil Actio de praescriptus verbisbefore the Governor of the province. If,
however, the Treasury, or anyone else, should demand of you the same property,
which is in your possession, and with reference to the ownership of which the
decision was rendered in the aforesaid case, you cannot claim anything.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof November, during the Consulate of the Caesars,
294.
34. The Same, and the Caesars, to Cyrillus and Ptolemaidus.
As you state that you have knowingly, by reason of either a donation or a
compromise, released your brother from what was due to you on account of the
administration of a guardianship, and as fraud cannot be committed against
anyone who gives his consent, you will in vain complain of it; for no one is
compelled to fulfill an obligation by the promise of his own estate.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof November, during the Consulate of the Caesars,
294.
35. The Same, and the Caesars, to Hammon.
It having been shown that a compromise made by the transfer of the ownership of
property or by the dismissal of an action has actually
taken place through the intervention of friends, the demand of the plaintiff
that it should be rescinded under the pretext of duress discloses his bad
faith.
Given at Nicomedia, on the ninth of the Kalendsof December, during the
Consulate of the Caesars, 294.
36. The Same, and the Caesars, to Achilla.
If you negotiated a compromise when you were more than twenty-five years of
age, and those who executed the agreement are not proved to have done so, and
do not consent to it, equity demands that nothing more be required of them.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof December, under the Consulate
of the Caesars, 294.
37. The Same, and the Caesars, to Basylissa.
Where promises made on account of a compromise have not been fulfilled, it is
established that the penalty included in the stipulation can be exacted, in
case the contract is violated.
Given at Nicomedia, on the twelfth of the Kalendsof January, during the
Consulate of the Caesars, 294.
38. The Same, and the Caesars, to Theodotian.
A compromise is of no effect unless something is given, retained,
or promised.
Given at Nicomedia, on the eighth of the Kalendsof January, during the
Consulate of the Caesars, 294.
39. The Same, and the Caesars, to Martian.
Although the person who made the compromise may immediately repent of having
done so, still the agreement cannot be rescinded, and the lawsuit renewed; and
he who has convinced you that it is lawful to repudiate a compromise within a
certain time states what is false.
Given on the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the Caesars, 294.
40. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Eutroplus, Praetorian
Prefect.
When the agreement or compromise has been committed to writing, and it has
acquired legal effect through the stipulation and release made under the
Aquilian Law, either consent must be given to other matters which have been
properly added, or the penalty, together with what is proved to have been
conceded before the case was heard, shall be collected (if the adversary wishes
this to be done).
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Nonesof June, during the
Consulship of Eucherius and Syagrius, 381.
41. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Rufinus, Praetorian Prefect.
If anyone over twenty-five years of age should think that, either by applying
to the judge, or by petitioning the Emperor, or by not
fulfilling his promises which he confirmed by invoking the name of Almighty
God, he can violate contracts or compromises which have not been made with the
employment of force, but have been negotiated with his free will and consent,
he shall not only be branded with infamy, but shall also be deprived of his
right of action; and after having paid the penalty inserted in the agreement,
he shall lose the ownership of the property, and the advantages which he would
have obtained through the said agreement or compromise. Therefore, all these
things shall be to the advantage of those who preserve their contracts
inviolate, and We order that they shall be considered worthy of the praise or
benefit of this law who, inserting Our name in their contracts, swear that the
invocation of the Emperor is the confirmation of the agreements which they have
made.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifth of the Idesof October, during the
Consulate of Olybrius and Probinus, 395.
42. The Emperors Leo and Anthemius to Achrochirius, Praetorian Prefect.
When compromises or agreements based upon forged documents have been made, even
though an oath may have been taken with reference to them, We, nevertheless,
order that, after their falsity has been disclosed, they shall be annulled, in
such a way, however, that if any compromise involving several cases or matters
has been effected, only that case or part shall be annulled which is proved to
have been inserted in a forged document, but all the others shall remain
unimpaired, unless where a controversy having arisen with reference to
something which is said to be false, it has been settled by compromise.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Martian
and Zeno, 469.
43. The Emperor Anastasius to Thomas, Praetorian Prefect of Illyria.
We order that all compromises made with a view to disposing of litigation
already begun and pending, or which may afterwards arise, concerning the
servile condition, or serfs attached to the glebe, shall be carried out; or if
they should happen to have already been executed, and this has not been done
contrary to law, that they shall remain in full force, and shall not be
regarded as lacking stability on account of their tenor, for the reason that
they have been entered into on account of the servile condition, or serfdom.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of
Patricius and Hypatius, 541.


TITLE V. CONCERNING ERRORS IN CALCULATION.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Aurelianus Quartus.
It has frequently been decided that an error in calculation, whether it is
found in one contract or in several, shall not prejudice the truth;
and therefore it is an established rule of law that, even where accounts have
often been computed, they can again be examined, if the case has not been
finally decided, or a compromise has not been effected. Where, however, through
a mistake in calculation, you promised a certain sum of money as being due,
when it was not, you have a right to be released from the obligation.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof March, under the above-mentioned Consulate.
TITLE VI. CONCERNING LITIGATION.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Artemidorus.
For the reason that, when you were forbidden by the Prefect of Egypt from
bringing an action at any time, you did not appeal, obey his decision.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Sabinus,
Consul for the second time, and Anulinus, 217.
2. The Emperor Alexander to Polydorus.
The freedmen of others, as well as My own, are hereby prohibited from
practicing the profession of the law, even where they are learned in letters.
Given on the Nonesof March, during the Consulate of Julian, Consul for the
second time, and Crispinus, 225.
3. The Emperor Gordian to Flavian.
If, having voluntarily agreed upon the amount to be paid to your advocate as a
fee, you furnished security, just as if you had borrowed money from him and had
promised to repay it, and you have not confirmed your consent and your
obligation, and no legal business has been transacted during the term of two
years, you can protect yourself from payment by interposing an exception, and
can bring suit to recover the security furnished in the usual way on this
account.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof June, during the Consulate of Sabinus, Consul
for the second time, and Venustus, 241.
4. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Theodotus.
Anyone will, in vain, under the pretext of the absence of his advocate, attempt
to revive an action which has already been terminated.
Given at Nicomedia, on the fourth of the Kalendsof January, during the
Consulate of the Caesars, 294.
5. The Emperor Constantine to Helladius.
If advocates, without any regard for their reputation, should be found to have
collected excessive and unlawful sums under the pretext of fees, for the
transaction of business which they have undertaken, and, by demanding such
remuneration for themselves, inflict
serious injury and loss upon litigants, it is hereby decreed that all those who
are guilty of such extortion shall be immediately expelled from the profession.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Paulinus and
Julian, 326.
6. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Olybrius, Urban Prefect.
Anyone who desires to be a pleader cannot act as advocate and judge in the same
case, since a distinction must exist between those who decide cases and those
who argue them.
(1) Advocates shall, above all things, defend the cases of those who retain
them in such a way as to do nothing more than the success of the actions
demands, and they shall not employ abuse and slander. They must do whatever the
case requires, but refrain from vituperation; for if anyone should be so bold
as to think his case should be conducted not by argument but by personal
invective, he shall suffer the loss of reputation. Nor shall anyone be
permitted, after the case is terminated, to heap contumely upon his adversary
either openly or clandestinely.
(2) Moreover, an advocate must enter into no contract with the litigant who has
confided in him, and he must make no informal agreement with him.
(3) None of those whom it is lawful or proper to employ as advocates shall
treat with contempt what his client voluntarily offers him in payment for his
services.
(4) No one shall himself delay the trial of a case which has been entrusted to
him.
(5) Those who, in the City of Rome, have adopted the legal profession, are
permitted to practice it as much as they desire, provided they do not take
occasion to obtain dishonorable profits, and unreasonable fees, but may only
seek to increase their professional reputation. Where, however, they are
influenced by the love of gain and money, they shall be considered abject and
degenerate, and be classed as the meanest of mankind.
(6) Therefore, let each of those whom We permit to practice this profession,
and who desires to be an advocate, know that while he does so, he can only
exercise this calling and no other. And let none of them think that he is
deprived of any honor, when he has himself selected the position of advocate,
and relinquished that of judge.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of
Valentinian and Valens, 368.
7. The Same and Gratian to Olybrius, Urban Prefect.
Care must be taken to prevent those who attain to a high rank at the bar,
either through their merits or their erudition, from being engaged on one side,
when the other is necessarily committed to such as are without skill or
experience; and therefore if two or more of superior reputation are not to be
found in the same court, it shall be
the duty of the judge to make such an assignment of the advocates that an equal
division may take place and each party have proper assistance. If, however, an
advocate notified by the judge should refuse to appear for one of the parties,
and offers an excuse which cannot be accepted, he shall be dismissed from the
bar, and he is also notified that he can never again have an opportunity to
practice his profession.
When any litigant has been shown to have retained several advocates separately,
and by such a fraud prevented his adversary from making an adequate defence, he
discloses beyond doubt that the suit which he has brought is unjust, and that
he has attempted to deceive
the court.
Given on the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Valentinian and Valens,
both Consuls for the third time, 370.
8. The Emperors Leo and Anthemius to Nicostratus, Praetorian Prefect.
No one shall be admitted to practice in your court, or in any provincial one,
nor shall appear with other members of the bar before any judge, unless he has
been initiated into the holy mysteries of the Catholic Religion. Moreover, if
anything should be done or attempted in any way, or by any artifice whatsoever,
in violation of this law, your office shall be compelled to pay a fine of a
hundred pounds of
gold.
Again, anyone who dares to surreptitiously usurp the office of advocate,
contrary to the Decree which We have promulgated, and practices the legal
profession without authority, shall be removed from the position of advocate,
shall have his property confiscated, and shall be sentenced to perpetual exile;
and Governors of provinces are also hereby notified that he under whose
administration anything of this kind is attempted shall be deprived of half of
his property, and sentenced to exile for the term of five years.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Kalendsof April, during the
Consulate of Anthemius, Consul for the second time, 468.


TITLE VII.
CONCERNING THE ADVOCATES OF DIFFERENT TRIBUNALS.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Dolo.
If you think that the advocate in the case has been guilty of prevarication,
and you prove the charge, sentence shall be passed upon him in accordance with
the gravity of the offence which he has committed, and the suit shall again be
commenced. But if you do not establish the prevarication, you will be branded
as guilty of false accusation, and the case shall stand as decided, unless an
appeal has been taken.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of Antoninus,
Consul for the fourth time, and Albinus, 214.
2. The Emperors Valens, Gratian, and Valentinian to Antony, Praetorian Prefect.
We are unwilling to permit those who are compelled to perform the duties of
office in the cities of their residence, and are assembled as decurions, to go
from one place to another, or act as advocates, and they must discharge the
functions of curule employments in their own towns, in such a way, however,
that they shall not be allowed to appear in cases against the municipality in
which they have obtained this honor.
Given at Ravenna, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof September, during the
Consulate of Valens, Consul for the sixth time, and Valentinian, Consul for the
second time, 378.
3. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Africanus, Praetorian Prefect.
No member of the bar who holds a civil office, unless he is a decurion, shall
undertake to discharge his official duties in his province, as those who
intrigue to obtain them are excluded; and, on the other hand, they are obliged
to accept such offices even against their will.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Nonesof August, during the
Consulate of Arcadius, Consul for the fourth time, and Honorius, Consul for the
third time, 394.
4. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Eustachius, Praetorian Prefect.
The advocates belonging to your bar and jurisdiction are entitled to what they
may have gained in the practice of their profession, or on this occasion; and
they can claim it as their own property after the death of their father, just
as they could do their peculium castrense,if they were in the military service.
Given at Constantinople, on the tenth of the Kalendsof April, during the
Consulate of Honorius, Consul for the thirteenth time, and Theodosius, Consul
for the tenth time, 422.
5. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Cyrus, Urban Prefect.
The advocates of the Illustrious Urban Prefecture are hereby notified that the
same privileges which We, actuated by generosity and Imperial munificence, have
granted to members of the bar belonging to the Illustrious Prefecture of the
East, through respect for their attainments, are bestowed upon them by the
present law.
Given at Constantinople, on the seventh of the Kalendsof January, during the
Consulate of Theodosius, Consul for the twelfth time, and Valentinian, Consul
for the second time, 426.
6. The Same to Florentius, Praetorian Prefect.We order that no charge be
imposed, under any circumstances, by your Illustrious Prefecture, or by any
judge, upon advocates who
are practicing in your jurisdiction; and let no one think that any charges can
be imposed upon the advocates of the provinces, or upon the distinguished
judges. Hence no inspection of public works can be required of advocates; nor
can they be compelled to superintend any division of property, or the
construction of any work; or take part in any argument, or any settlement of
accounts; and finally, no civil duties should be exacted from them, with the
exception of that of arbitration, and this only in the place where they
practice their profession; and if anyone should attempt to violate the
provisions of this law, he shall be liable to the penalty of fifty pounds of
gold.
Given at Constantinople, on the seventh of the Kalendsof March, during the
Consulate of Theodosius, Consul for the seventeenth time, and Festus, 439.
7. The Same to Thalassius, Praetorian Prefect of Illyria.
We decree that the Bar of the Illustrious Prefecture of Illyria shall enjoy the
same privileges and immunities as are enjoyed by that of the Eminent Praetorian
Prefecture of the East.
Given at Constantinople, on the seventh of the Idesof September, during the
Consulate of Theodosius, Consul for the seventeenth time, and Festus, 439.
8. The Same to Cyrus, Praetorian Prefect and Consul Elect.
The number of praetorian advocates is limited to a hundred and fifty, and cannot
be either diminished or increased. We order that those who are selected from
them to represent the Treasury shall, together with their children already born
and who may be born at any time hereafter, be exempt from the obligations
growing out of attendance upon public functionaries, or those of any other
inferior condition; and when they have relinquished their office, after having
exercised it for an entire year, they can leave the Order of Advocates, and
resign the office of consistorial count; and, by the authority of this law We
decree that everything which has been obtained in any case by the advocates of
your bar, under any title whatsoever, they can claim as their own, in the same
manner as castrense peculium,and that such property cannot be acquired by their
fathers or their paternal grandfathers.
These provisions apply to all the advocates of the Urban Prefecture.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Valentinian and Anatolius, 440.
9. The Same to Apollonius, Praetorian Prefect.
If anyone of the members of your bar or of that of the Illyrian, or of the
urban Prefecture, or of those who practice their profession in the tribunals of
the province, should through your selection undertake the task of governing a
province, after having discharged the duty of his office honorably and without
reproach, he shall have the power to resume the calling from which he was
taken, and by which
he obtained the means of subsistence, and he cannot be prevented, by the malice
of anyone, from again trying cases.
Given at Constantinople, on the twelfth of the Kalendsof September, during the
Consulate of Eudoxius and Dioscorus, 442.
10. The Emperors Valentinian and Martian to Palladius, Praetorian Prefect.
We order that every year the two advocates of the highest reputation in your
tribunal shall be selected to represent the Treasury, and shall enjoy the same
honors and privileges enjoyed by him who formerly was appointed Advocate of the
Treasury.
Given at Constantinople, on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof July, during the
Consulate of Herculanus and Asporatius, 452.
11. The Emperor Leo to Vivianus, Praetorian Prefect.
We order that no one shall, under the pretext of assistants, be permitted to
increase the prescribed number of a hundred and fifty advocates, who form the
Council of your Illustrious Prefecture.
(1) Moreover, no one can be admitted to the Order of Advocates in your
jurisdiction, unless, after having undergone the examination of the eminent
Governor of the province where he was born, in the presence of the subordinate
officials, it becomes clear that he is in no way liable to the life and
fortunes of the latter. We wish this to be done in the presence of the Governor
of the province, and if he should be absent, the proofs must be established
before the municipal defender. We order that persons distinguished for legal
erudition, and doctors of the law, shall certify under oath that he who desires
to be admitted is learned in the science of jurisprudence.
We also desire that the sons of advocates of your bar who are now practicing,
or shall do so at some future time, shall be preferred to all other
supernumeraries.1
(2) In addition to this We decree that those who exceed the number of one
hundred and fifty advocates, belonging to your bar, shall be permitted to
appear before the Illustrious Proconsul, the Augustal Prefect, the Count of the
East, the eminent vicegerents, and the Governors of provinces, for the purpose
of conducting cases.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof February, under the Consulate of
Magnus and Apollonius, 460.
12. The Same to Eusebius, Praetorian Prefect of Illyria.
We order that the Advocate of the Treasury who is attached to your tribunal
shall surrender his office at the end of two years here-
1 The division of the Roman bar into two classes, one the advocates proper,
constituting a corporate body, or collegium,whose number was established by law
in every city; and the supernumeraries, from whom, in the order of their rank,
as inscribed upon the public registers, all vacancies in the former class were
filled, dated from the reign of Constantine. The supernumeraries did not belong
to any legal organization; their residence was not, like that of their
superiors, restricted to any particular locality; and they had the right to
practice anywhere in courts of inferior jurisdiction, but enjoyed no special
privileges.  ED.
after, and not every year as formerly; and that he shall continue to enjoy all
the privileges conferred upon him by former Emperors.
Given at Constantinople, on the tenth of the Kalendsof March, during the
Consulate of Basilius and Vivianus, 463.
13. The Emperors Leo and Anthemius to Alexander, Praetorian Prefect.
As we consider the petition of the learned men of Alexandria, which they have
presented with reference to their bar and the Advocate of the Treasury, to be
reasonable, We decree, by this law, that their number shall consist of fifty;
that the name of each of them, according to the date of his membership, shall
be entered upon the register; and that they can give their professional
services to those requesting them, not only in the tribunal of the Illustrious
Augustal Prefect, but also in that of the Illustrious Governor of Egypt. The
advocates who are not included in the above-mentioned number can appear before
the other judges of the said city of Alexandria, and their sons shall be
preferred to other supernumeraries, when places in the Order become vacant.
The Advocate of the Treasury, who leaves his office after the lapse of two
years, shall, as a reward for his services, receive the office of consular
ruler of the province, and when circumstances demand it, the right and
authority to conduct cases not only for himself, but also for his children, his
parents, and his wife, as well as for persons related to him in the collateral
line as far as the fourth degree, shall not be denied him.
When, however, an Advocate of the Treasury dies, the one who is next in rank
shall be given his place, without delay, and the heirs of the deceased cannot
expect to derive any benefit for themselves on this account, and all the
privileges which are known to have been enjoyed by them up to this time, as
well as those which have been conferred by Your Highness, shall be preserved
intact and inviolate hereafter; and they can pass the rest of their lives in
leisure and peace, through the favor which We have shown them, and no civil
employment can be imposed upon them without their consent.
14. The Same to Callicrates, Praetorian Prefect of Illyria.
Advocates who explain ambiguous questions which arise in the course of
litigation, and who, by the ability of their defence, frequently, in both
private and public matters, restore the fortunes of those who have been ruined,
are not less useful to the human race than if they had preserved their country
and their relatives by taking part in battles, and receiving wounds. For We do
not think that those who are equipped as soldiers with swords, shields, and
cuirasses should be considered the only ones who protect Our Empire, but that
the advocates, also, who have charge of cases contend as soldiers, and,
trusting in the glorious power of eloquence, protect the hopes, the lives, and
the children of those who are distressed.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifth of the Kalendsof April, during the
Consulate of Zeno and Martian, 469.
15. The Emperor Leo to Dioscorus, Praetorian Prefect.
After the two Advocates of the Treasury who, in accordance with Our previous
Constitutions, are entitled to the same benefits, We decree that all the
present members of the bar, sixty-four in number, from the first to the sixty-
fourth, shall enjoy the advantages conferred by the Emperors, with which the
advocates of the Treasury and their children have been honored.
(1) We also order that if anyone, after having obtained the rank of Advocate of
the Treasury, should die, his salary for the entire year, from the time that he
began to discharge the duties of his office, shall be transmitted to his heirs
or successors, whether they are his children or strangers, and that he shall
have the power to make this disposition by will, or the money shall pass ab
intestato.
Given at Constantinople, on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof June, during the
Consulate of Festus and Martian, 472.
16. The Emperors Leo Junior and Zeno, to Justinian, Praetorian Prefect of the
City.
The fifteen advocates of your bar who, at the present time, hold the first rank
after the Advocate of the Treasury, shall, like the sixty-four who constitute
the bar of the Praetorian Prefecture, be entitled to the same privileges
bestowed by Our Indulgence that Advocates of the Treasury and their children
enjoy.
Given at Constantinople, on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof April, during the
Consulate of Leo Junior, 474.
17. The Emperor Zeno to Paulus, Praetorian Prefect of Illyria.
We order that the number of members of the bar in your jurisdiction shall be
limited to a hundred and fifty (as was formerly provided); and that this
number, whenever diminished by retirement from the profession, by death, or for
any other reason, shall be restored by your selection; so that, within two
years from the present time, the number shall be complete. The members shall be
admitted without examination as to whether they belong to some official
retinue, or are of any other inferior class; and any right of action to which
the bailiffs may be entitled against them will undoubtedly be extinguished, so
far as those who have filled the office of Advocates of the Treasury are
concerned. After the expiration of two years, however, those who desire to be
admitted to the bar in your jurisdiction cannot do so, until it has been proved
that they do not belong to the inferior class of subordinate officials.
(1) We order by this law, which shall be valid for all time, that all
privileges, without exception, which have been granted to Advocates of the
Prefecture of the East, whether by the Rescripts of former Emperors, by those
of Leo of glorious memory, or by Our own, shall be conferred upon the advocates
of your illustrious jurisdiction.
Given at Constantinople, on the sixth of the Kalendsof January, during the
Consulate of Decius and Longinus, 486.


TITLE VIII. CONCERNING THE ADVOCATES OF DIFFERENT JUDGES.
1. The Emperor Anastasius to Eusebius, Master of the Offices.
We think that the suggestion of the illustrious Count of Private Affairs, and
the Proconsul of Asia, should be adopted, by which We have been informed that
the advocates of their bar have shown, by a petition presented by them, that
they greatly desire to obtain some mark of favor from Us, after having retired
from the practice of their profession. Therefore, We order that, after they
have ceased to perform their duties (as has already been stated), each of them
who is at present, or may afterwards be inscribed upon the registers in his
proper order, shall enjoy the dignity of count of the first rank, in order that
they may obtain in their retirement the fruit of their former labors; being
distinguished from the great body of men of a private condition by their
approved fidelity and industry as displayed towards their clients, and with
reason deserving to be numbered among those who are designated most
illustrious.
Given at Constantinople, on the eleventh of the Kalendsof January, during the
Consulate of Anastasius, Consul for the second time, 497.
2. The Same to Thomas, Praetorian Prefect of Illyria.
We decree that the advocates of your bar who have been raised to the rank of
Advocates of the Treasury, in accordance with their merits, shall, with their
children already born, or who may hereafter be born, and their property, be
immune and free from all subordinate public employments, or the disabilities of
any inferior condition whatsoever; as it is established that this privilege has
already been granted by the Imperial Constitutions to the Advocates of the
Praetorian Prefecture of the East, as well as to that of this magnificent City,
and there is no doubt that the authority of your office is equal to that of the
Urban Prefect and that of the Prefect of the Orient.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of
Patricius and Hypatius.
3. The Same to Constantine, Praetorian Prefect.
We order that the chief of the advocates of the bar of the Illustrious Count of
the East shall perform the functions of Advocate of the Treasury for the term
of two years, and that for the said term he shall receive the salary granted
him by common consent; and that when this time has expired, and he retires from
the office, the number of the said advocates shall be fixed at only forty; so
that, if there should be any over and above this number belonging to the bar,
they shall be excluded from practice as advocates, and no one else shall be
added to them, to prevent the number of the said advocates from being more than
forty. Those who (as has already been determined), have relinquished the office
of Advocate of the Treasury, shall not afterwards be prevented from performing
the duties of their pro-
fession for themselves, their wives, their fathers and mothers-in-law, their
sons-in-law, their daughters-in-law, their children, their tenants, and their
slaves; nor shall their houses be subject to the charge of lodging surveyors;
but each of them can only claim this privilege for himself with reference to
the house in which he resides. So far as the tax called sportulaeis concerned,
no one can exact more than has been stated in Our notice, not only with
reference to the persons above mentioned, but also with reference to their
tenants and slaves, and no one shall have permission to exceed this amount.
The sons of advocates, whether their fathers are living or dead, or are still
in active practice, or have retired from the office of Advocate of the
Treasury, shall be preferred to strangers applying for the same office, and
shall be admitted free, and without any expense, if they (as has been decided),
have studied the science of jurisprudence for the prescribed time. However, in
order that the interests of those who had obtained the office of Advocate of
the Treasury, both dead as well as living, may be protected, and they may have
their salaries transferred to the heirs of those who have been called to the
office of Advocate of the Treasury, and be preserved for such as have already
retired from the said office or who afterwards may do so; and that they may
not, under any circumstances be compelled, against their will, to be liable to
any public charge, or be annoyed by being forced to appear or be brought into
court (unless by Our special command), We order that only when application is
made in a province to the distinguished Count of the East and he gives his
approval, they can be sued, and their case heard before a competent judge.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of
Sabinian and Theodore, 505.
4. The Same to Eustatius, Praetorian Prefect.
The calling of advocate is one which is praiseworthy and necessary to human
life, and it should, by all means, be remunerated with princely generosity.
Therefore We order that the illustrious Advocates of the Treasury belonging to
your bar shall receive their salaries on the solemn day of the Festival of the
Kalendsof January, only for the year during which they have discharged the
duties of their office, in the same manner as the illustrious Counts of Our
Consistory. After they have retired from office, if they have any freeborn
sons, the latter should be made members of the eminent body of notaries, and
receive the ordinary sacred epistles of the tribunes, without the payment of
any fee.
Where, however, any one of them is notified of a debt and acknowledges it, or,
an action having been brought against him, he is ready to confess judgment,
this should not be done before an appointed arbiter, but before the Advocates
of the Treasury, or either of them (if only one can be present), in the usual
manner.
Whenever anyone desires to render legitimate children who have been born, or
are not yet born of a marriage celebrated without dotal instruments, and by
common consent, this can be effected before the
Advocates of the Treasury, or either of them (as already has been stated), and
a record must be made of the act in such a way that the rights of absent
persons, if there are any, shall be preserved unimpaired. In addition to this,
when anyone wishes to confer emancipation upon his slaves before the consuls,
he can avail himself of his own services as advocate, and liberate said slaves
in the same manner before the Advocates of the Treasury.
We also decree that the other privileges mentioned, which already have been
bestowed upon the Advocates of the Treasury, or upon those who temporarily have
discharged the duties of the office in different ways, shall remain in full
force under this Our law.
Given at Constantinople, on the twelfth of the Kalendsof December, during the
Consulate of Ariovinius and Messala, 506.
5. The Same to Sergius.
We have decided that the petitions of the learned members of the Bar of the
Second Province of Syria should be granted, with some modifications, and We
order that their chief shall perform the functions of Advocate of the Treasury
for the term of two years, and that he receive the salary for the said term
which is authorized by common consent for that purpose; and that when the said
term has expired, he shall relinquish the office of advocate.
The number of said advocates shall be limited to only thirty, so that if there
are any over and above that number in the bar at present, they shall, by all
means, retire from the general practice of their profession, and no one shall
be added to them in order that the number of twenty advocates aforesaid may not
be exceeded.
Moreover (as has been already decided), those who have retired from the office
of advocate are not forbidden to continue to represent themselves, their wives,
their fathers and mothers-in-law, their sons and daughters-in-law, their own
children, their tenants, and the slaves which belong to them, in court; nor
shall they be subject to the inconvenience of having their houses used for the
lodging of surveyors, provided they are willing to claim for themselves this
privilege with reference to only a single house.
So far as the tax designated sportulaeis concerned, they cannot be compelled to
pay a greater amount than is specified in the notice which We have published;
and this rule applies not only to them, but also to their tenants and slaves;
nor shall anyone be admitted to their Order aforesaid, except those who are
known to have been engaged in the study of jurisprudence during the prescribed
time. The sons of advocates who are still in office, or of those who have
retired from the Treasury, whether they be living or dead, shall be preferred
to strangers applying for the same employment, and they shall be admitted
gratis, and without any expense, provided they (as has been established), have
studied law for the usual time.
Again, in order that the interests of those who have held the office of
advocate, or shall hold it hereafter, whether living or dead, may be protected,
We desire that their salaries shall be transmitted to the
heirs of any Advocate of the Treasury who has once been raised to that dignity,
and shall be preserved for them; and that those who have retired from the said
office, or may do so hereafter, shall, by no means, be compelled to undertake
any public charge against their will, or be annoyed by being compelled to be
produced, or brought into court (unless by Our special command), and if, in any
province in which they may be, they should be declared liable by a decree of
the Governor, only under such circumstances can they be sued and compelled to
defend themselves before a competent judge.
Given on the Kalendsof December, under the Consulate of Anatolius and Agapitus,
508.
6. The Emperor Justin to Marinus, Praetorian Prefect.
Sixty pounds of gold shall be paid to the illustrious Advocate of the Treasury,
which, under the Emperor Zeno of Divine memory, was fixed as the compensation
for ordinary judges and those persons appointed to determine the solvency of
sureties; the aforesaid Emperor, however, thought that this amount should be
reduced by half, and in order that, through Our Liberality, the illustrious
Advocates of the Treasury may obtain the above-mentioned sum of gold, without
fail, every year, it shall be divided equally between the two advocates of your
tribunal; for any privilege which, in accordance with the wish of all, is
conferred upon their chief, is also conferred upon the entire bar.
(1) In addition to this, We think that the sacred letters which are presented
to an illustrious praetorian tribune or notary for his approval, shall be
despatched not only in the name of one, but of both Advocates of the Treasury,
whether their own children or those of some other persons are concerned.
(2) We promise, moreover, that they shall be entitled to the same privileges
granted to those who are honored with the higher dignity; and that the document
bestowing them, even though made out in the name of only one, shall still
benefit another, with the consent of him who has obtained it, and therefore can
be issued to any person from their own province, or to one of their friends,
provided he resides therein.
(3) We also grant them permission to present every year the names of two men,
for the purpose of rendering homage to Us, and to be enrolled in Our body-
guard, one among the cavalry, and the other among the infantry, to replace
those who may have died; and no agreement shall be made for the purpose of
disposing of their positions as long as they live. Therefore, when these men
offer themselves for enrollment, the commanders of the guard shall pay them two
solidi,and no more, for every mile which they have come, and they are hereby
notified that only the customary sums, that is to say, what is usually allotted
to those who served, either in the cavalry or infantry, will be paid by their
distinguished commanders by way of compensation to the said inexperienced
recruits, without any other expenditure whatsoever.
(4) They shall also enjoy other privileges which have been conferred upon them
at different times, whether by Imperial Decrees or in accordance with the
regulations and decisions of your tribunal; but all who have been deemed worthy
of being selected by Us are entitled to greater favor than those who previously
have been appointed.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of
Constantine and Euthericus, 531.
7. The Same to Theodore, Praetorian Prefect.
We decree by this law that, until the number of members of your bar shall have
been reduced to eighty, no one can aspire to belong to it on any ground
whatever, except the sons of those who hold the rank of the first thirty, after
they have been instructed in eloquence; and they shall be admitted
gratuitously, and without the payment of any fee, or if they are strangers,
only two shall be admitted each year, who must themselves be conspicuous for
their eloquence and legal ability. After the number of advocates has been
reduced to eight, no one shall presume to exceed this number by the exercise of
either intrigue or duplicity.
(1) No one shall be permitted to change the order of precedence which is
indicated by the time of service, so that the young may succeed to the old, as
is the case where alterations are made with reference to the contracts of
merchants belonging to corporate bodies.
(2) We think that it also should be decided that none of them shall leave your
jurisdiction for the purpose of residing elsewhere; for all those who have
obtained the rank of advocate are notified that, if they should be absent from
this Most Sacred City for more than three years, the title of advocate and the
privileges of the order shall be taken from them, to prevent them from
absenting themselves from your jurisdiction, or making repeated voyages.
(3) If the most unimportant of these provisions should be violated at any time,
the twenty chiefs of this Order, who perform their duties under your
jurisdiction, as well as their assistants, shall each be punished by a fine of
ten pounds of gold, for the reason that they did not immediately invoke the aid
of the present law against the disobedience of Our Imperial commands, and
offered no resistance, and in no way prevented anything being done in
opposition thereto. And as the officials of your tribunal did not carefully
observe these salutary provisions, and did not take measures to prevent their
being infringed, they also shall pay a penalty of ten pounds of gold.
(4) Six hundred aureishall be set apart from the Treasury of your tribunal for
those who have exercised the office of Advocates of the Treasury, in your
jurisdiction, in accordance with the precedent of former times, in order that,
after the termination of their administration and of their glorious labors,
they may not come to want; and this sum shall not (as frequently happens), be
paid at an uncertain time, but it shall, without delay, come into their hands
when the half
of their term of service as Advocate of the Treasury has expired; that is to
say, on the Kalendsof October of each year.
(5) Any additional privileges that have been granted to this order by former
Emperors, or by the authority of any competent tribunal, shall remain
inviolate.
. (6) When an action is brought against any of these advocates, whether the
proceeding is a civil or a criminal one, or instituted here or in the
provinces, and it happens that the party is present at the prescribed time, the
bailiffs cannot collect anything as fees; and We decree that those who are
charged with prosecuting the case shall not think that any expenses can be
exacted of him either for interposing an exception, for preparing the case, or
on any other reason whatsoever.
Given at Constantinople, on the Idesof February, during the Consulate of
Justinian and Opilio, 524.
8. The Same to Archelaus, Praetorian Prefect.
No one, with the exception of Menander, Advocate of the Treasury, shall hope to
enjoy the advantages conferred upon Advocates of the Treasury when they have
obtained this office through cunning, or are proved to have done so without
having passed through the different degrees required for promotion.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of
Justinian and Opilio, 524.
9. The Emperor Justinian to John, Praetorian Prefect.
The Advocates of Illyria have asked Us whether the Constitution of Our Father,
Justin, of Divine Memory, promulgated with reference to the members of the bar
of your jurisdiction, is applicable to them, and that Our opinion thereon be
given, supposing they should be absent from your jurisdiction with or without
leave; and therefore We have ordered that this law shall apply to all of them
in general, so that if anyone should be absent continuously for more than three
years, without permission, or for more than five years with permission, his
name shall be struck from the roll of advocates, and he shall not be permitted
to claim his rank, or again be included among the most learned members of the
bar. Therefore, let the advocates of this jurisdiction comply with this Our
general decree.


TITLE IX. CONCERNING THE ADVOCATES OF THE TREASURY.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Claudius.
As you state that you have undertaken to defend the cause of the Treasury,
although you deny that you have received any compensation, you should,
nevertheless, comply with the rules, for those who represent the Treasury are
forbidden to give their services in any case against it.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Antoninus, Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
2. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus to Frequentius.
You can, by Our authority, give your services to individuals against the
Government, provided you decline to conduct a case in which you appeared at the
time when you were the Advocate of the Treasury.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Valerian,
Consul for the second time, and Gallienus, 255.
3. The Emperor Constantine to Ælianus, Proconsul of Africa.
An Advocate of the Treasury, who does not wish to render himself liable to
punishment, must be careful not to neglect the interests of the Government; or,
where there are no grounds for it, presume, in the name of the Treasury, to
bring annoying actions against individuals.
Given at Constantinople, on the sixth of the Idesof November, during the
Consulate of Constantine and Licinius, Consuls for the fourth time, 315.
4. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Amianus, Count of
Private Affairs.
Officials who preside over cases in which private persons or the Government is
interested, must conduct the inquiry in the presence of the Advocate of the
Treasury.
Given on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Merobaudus and Saturninus, 383.


TITLE X.
CONCERNING THE ERRORS OP ADVOCATES AND THOSE WHO DRAW UP PETITIONS OR
APPLICATIONS.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Aurelia.
The allegations made by advocates in the presence of the parties to an action
shall be considered to be the same as if they had been made by the parties
themselves.1
Given on the Kalendsof March, under the Consulate of Albinus and Maximus, 228.
2. The Emperor Gordian to the Soldier Rogatus.
It is evident that the errors of those who draw up applications, that is to say
petitions, cannot prejudice the truth; and therefore, if it can be clearly
proved that the condemnation which you have mentioned in your petition did not
take place, he who is to take cog-
1 "Qui tacet consentire videtur." ED.
nizance of the matter will know that your allegations can cause you no injury.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Pius and
Pontianus, 239.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Ulpia.
When the case has been terminated by a decision, the latter cannot be set aside
by a rescript, for the rule which has been established, namely, that the error
of an advocate does not injure a litigant, cannot be of any benefit to you;
since, as you were present, and did not openly, and at once, that is to say
within the next three days, deny the allegations, and did not, after the
decision had been rendered, take advantage of an appeal in case you were
displeased with the decision.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 294.
TITLE XL
THE JUDGE MUST SUPPLY ANYTHING WHICH THE ADVOCATES OF THE PARTIES HAVE OMITTED.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Honoratus.
There is no doubt that where anything is omitted by the litigants in a case, or
by those who represent them, the judge can supply it, and state what he knows
to be in conformity with law and public justice.
Given on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of
Diocletian, Consul for the fifth time, and Maximian, Consul for the fourth
time, 293.


TITLE XII.
IN WHAT CASES INFAMY Is INCURRED.
1. The Emperor Severus and Antoninus to Manilius.
The disgrace of infamy will not be inflicted upon you by the mere fact that you
have been thrown into prison, or have been placed in chains, by order of the
judge.
No day or Consul given.
2. The Same to Venerius.
He who has been condemned to pay double damages by the Governor for having
exacted from his debtors more than was due, can not be considered to have been
convicted of theft, robbery with violence, or peculation.
Given on the third of the Idesof January, during the Consulate of Lateranus and
Rufinus, 298.
3. The Same to Metrodorus.
If you are said to have deserved a more severe sentence, and the Proconsul,
being induced by certain reasons, imposes a milder one, and orders you to be
removed from the rank of decurion for the term of two years, it is clear that
after it has elapsed, you will not be included in the number of persons who are
infamous, because the judge is considered to have remitted his prohibition
excluding you from the Order of Decurions after the expiration of two years.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of Lateranus
and Rufinus, 198.
4. The Same to Venustianus.
If you prove that Posidonius should have been relegated only for the term of a
year, and that the Proconsul has imposed an excessive sentence of temporary
exile for five years upon him, he must not be considered infamous, as the
severity of the sentence would appear to have reference to other additional
offences.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Saturninus
and Gallus, 199.
5. The Same to Ambrosius.
It is forbidden for decurions and their sons to be whipped with rods, but if
the illustrious Proconsul should decide that you have committed an injury
rendering you liable to such punishment, you will be branded with infamy.
Given on the Kalendsof July, under the Consulate of Saturninus and Gallus, 199.
6. The Same to Justus.
Those who are condemned to the public works for a certain time, retain their
former condition, but after the time has elapsed they will be subjected to the
penalty of infamy.
Given on the seventh of the Idesof December, during the Consulate of Geta and
Plautian, 204.
7. The Same to Demetrius.
No one becomes infamous for the reason that he has rejected his father's
estate.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof January, under the Consulate of Antoninus and
Geta, both Consuls for the second time, 206.
8. The Same to Ulpia.
If you have been condemned for theft, you will undergo the penalty for infamy,
without having been whipped. If property which someone else has stolen is found
in your possession, and you are not aware of the fact, a severe sentence will
not injure your reputation.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Antoninus
and Geta, both Consuls for the second time, 206.
9. The Same to Gaetus.
No one is branded with infamy for not having defended the public affairs of his
country.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Antoninus
and Geta, both Consuls for the third time, 209.
10. The Same to Severus.
Any one who is convicted of the offence of injury, even though committed
against a slave, is branded with infamy.
Given on the fourth of the Kalendsof August, during the same Consulate, 209.
11. The Emperor Alexander to Herennius.
Where debtors have surrendered their property, although it may be sold, they do
not become infamous for this reason.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and Ælianus, 204.
12. The Same to Donatus.
When it is shown, by the decree of the Governor, that you have plundered an
estate, even if another penalty should be imposed upon you, you will not escape
the infamy attaching to the crime of theft.
Given on the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Julian, Consul for the
second time, and Crispinus, 225.
13. The Same to Juventius.
When a father reviles his sons in his will, this does not render them infamous
by law, but causes good and serious men to have a bad opinion of them, as
having displeased their father.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of
Alexander, Consul for the third time, and Dionysius, 230.
14. The Emperor Gordian to Jovinus.
Your uncle having been subjected to the penalty of whipping, as a torture for
crime committed, need not, on this account, apprehend the loss of reputation,
if he had not previously received a sentence branding him with infamy.
Given on the Kalendsof September, under the Consulate of Pius and Pontianus,
239.
15. The Same to Sulpitia.
The obligation of mourning exacted of women having been diminished by the
Decree of the Senate, they are excused from assuming sombre clothing, and
manifesting other indications of grief, but they are not permitted to contract
marriage within the period during which a wife usually mourns for her husband;
for even if a widow should be married within this time, not only she, but also
the man who know-
ingly married her, even though he be a soldier, becomes guilty of want of
decency, under the terms of the Perpetual Edict.
Given on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Gordian
and Aviola, 240.
16. The Same to Domitian.
It is clear that he who has been beaten with rods, and proclaimed by the public
crier to have been guilty of slander, in order that he may be branded as a
calumniator, becomes infamous for this reason.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Sabinus and
Venustus, 241.
17. The Same to Magnus.
An allegation inserted in a petition seems rather to cause reproach than to
blemish one's reputation; for when a statement is made out of court claiming
that you have committed calumny, and this statement is repeated by the judge
during the argument of the advocate, it does not, by any means, inflict infamy.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of Atticus
and Praetexatus, 243.
18. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus to Antiochus.
The Perpetual Edict not only renders persons infamous who have been convicted
of crime, but also anyone who has made an agreement with reference to it. In
cases of this kind, it has been decided that those have made such an agreement
who, with evil design and for the purpose of compromise, have paid money to an
adversary; he, however, who has done this without paying anything, shall suffer
no loss of reputation. If, however, the case should be decided by an oath, no
one can doubt that the party will be discharged after having been sworn by the
judge.
Given on the fourteenth of the Kalends ofJanuary, during the Consulate of
Secular, Consul for the second time, and Donatus, 261.
19. The Emperors Carinus and Numerian to Aristocratus.
The interruption of the Governor, which is the point to be decided, does not
seem to have rendered the person infamous concerning whom you have made
inquiry, since he was not specifically condemned for crime or violence, which
he committed, but only reprimanded, and warned by the Governor to lead a more
regular life hereafter.
Given on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of
Carinus, Consul for the second time, and Numerian, 284.
20. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Fortunatus.
Those who exercise the disgraceful occupation of usury, and unlawfully collect
interest on interest, should be branded with infamy.
Given on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof March, during the same Consulate,
284.
21. The Same, and the Caesars, to Statius.
If your brothers were minors when they exhibited themselves to the people in a
play, they will suffer no loss of reputation.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof September, during the same Consulate, 284.
22. The Same, and the Caesars, to Domitian.
Where a person who is associated with others is guilty of bad faith, and is
sued in his own name as a partner, and compelled to give satisfaction, he
incurs the risk of infamy.
Given at Nicomedia, on the sixth of the Idesof December, during the Consulate
of the Caesars.


TITLE XIII. CONCERNING ATTORNEYS.
1. The Divine Antoninus Pius to Severus.
A bond for the ratification of the transaction is required of an attorney, when
it is uncertain whether or not he has received authority from his principal.
Given on the fourth of the Idesof October, during the Consulate of Gallicanus
and Venustus, 151.
2. The Divine Brothers to Sextilia.
As you allege that the case is a pecuniary one, you can answer the appeal of
your adversary by your husband, after the prescribed formalities have been
complied with, for, in pecuniary cases, appeals can be made by either of the
litigants through attorneys.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof August, during the same Consulate, 163.
3. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Pomponius.
Summon the person who transacts the business of the heirs from whom you allege
a trust is due to you before the illustrious Praetor, and he will be compelled
to answer you, or he will be forbidden to administer their affairs according to
the legal practice of the jurisdiction; and if the heirs are not defended, the
Praetor will ascertain whether he should give you possession, according to the
custom which prevails where parties do not make a defence.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of Chilo
and Libo, 205.
4. The Same to Saturninus.
For the reason that you allege that judgment was rendered against you during
your absence, it is just that you should have an opportunity to defend
yourself, and you cannot be opposed on the ground that your wife was present
when the judgment was rendered, or even that she acquiesced in it; as the
business of others cannot be transacted
by women as attorneys, unless the actions in which they are ordered to appear
relate to their own property and advantage.
Given on the day before the Nonesof January, during the Consulate of Aper and
Maximus, 208.
5. The Emperor Antoninus to Pancratia.
It has been provided by the Perpetual Edict that an action must be refused to
anyone who desires to act in the name of an absent person, if he does not
defend him in a counter action.
Given on the fourth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of the two
Aspers, 215.
6. The Emperor Alexander to Martian.
It is well known that where anyone is accused of crime, he cannot undertake the
defence of a case before, establishing his own innocence.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and Ælianus, 224.
7. The Same to Macrinus.
A soldier cannot act as attorney either for his father, his mother, or his
wife, even under the authority of a rescript; as the public welfare does not
permit him to undertake the defence of another, or transact business, or act as
advocate.
Given on the eighth of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and Ælianus, 224.
8. The Same to Mansuetus.
Anyone who authorizes you to collect a debt for him cannot engage another to do
so before issue has been joined.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of
Maximus, Consul for the second time, and Ælianus, 224.
9. The Same to Aufidius.
Soldiers can attend to their own affairs without committing a breach of
discipline, nor can it be said that he transacts the business of another who
honorably and faithfully, and for some good reason, conducts suits which have
been entrusted to his care; for when a right of action has been transferred to
him by another, in good faith, there is no doubt that he is transacting his own
business, and to forbid My soldiers to do this would not only be absurd, but
unjust.
10. The Same to Castia.
When an attorney especially appointed for one purpose exceeds his directions,
anything that he does can, in no way, prejudice his principal. If, however, he
has full power to act, a decision in the case cannot be rescinded, for if any
fraud has been committed, you will not be prevented from suing him in the
ordinary manner.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof March, under the Consulate of Albinus and
Maximus, 228.
11. The Same to Sebastian.
Neither guardians nor curators can personally appoint an attorney to transact
the business of their wards or minors, but they can appoint an agent. A ward or
an adult of either sex can, however, with the authority of his or her guardian
or curator, appoint an attorney either to bring a suit, or to defend it.
Moreover, guardians and curators themselves, like attorneys, are not forbidden
to appoint attorneys after legal proceedings have been instituted.
Given on the day before the Idesof May, during the Consulate of Alexander,
Consul for the third time, and Dio, 230.
12. The Same to Frontonus.
Two reasons exist for not rendering it necessary for a mandate to be required
of your son, who offers himself to defend you; because anyone, whether he be a
freedman or a stranger, can defend another without a mandate, where security is
given for the defence, and another formality elsewhere mentioned is complied
with; and for the reason that a son who, of his own accord, conducts a case in
the name of his father, is not obliged to prove that he has been ordered to do
so. And, indeed, if your son has not yet attained his majority, the judge
should not unjustly deprive him of the duty of acting as attorney; for it is
much more equitable to hear a defender of this kind than to impose a severe
penalty upon you for being contumacious, and not providing for your defence
during your absence.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of Agricola
and Clementinus, 231.
13. The Emperor Gordian to the Soldier Lucian.
You can begin an action which your mother directed you to bring, if, when you
institute proceedings in her name, an exception is not interposed on the ground
of military service, because it cannot be pleaded against you when an appeal is
taken; but if nothing has yet been done, the terms of the Perpetual Edict will
not permit you to bring suit in the name of another.
Given on the third of the Idesof January, during the Consulate of Gordian and
Aviola, 240.
14. The Same to Sabinian.
Ajudgment rendered against you is none the less valid by law for the reason
that your adversary is under the age of twenty-five years and cannot, without
the consent of a curator, entrust her husband with the conduct of her case; for
while age affords a good reason for relief in cases where minors sustain
injury, it is not customary to plead it where they have profited by the
transaction.
Given on the third of the Nonesof October, during the Consulate of Gordian,
Consul for the second time, and Pompeianus, 242.
15. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Cornificius.
You have stated clearly in your petition that you have, contrary to good
morals, purchased a lawsuit. Although, for anyone voluntarily to act as
attorney (which office should be gratuitous), is not an unlawful transaction,
an act of this kind cannot be undertaken without exposing the person to blame.
Given on the third of the Nonesof April, during the Consulate of the Caesars,
294.
16. The Same, and the Caesars, to Paconia.
It is perfectly clear and certain that an attorney or agent who has charge of a
tract of land, and has not received a special order to sell it, has no right to
dispose of the property of his principal; and, therefore, if you purchased this
land from persons who alienated it without the consent of the owner, you will
perceive that you have no right to have the title to said property transferred
to you by means of a purchase of this kind.
Given at Byzantium, on the Nonesof April, during the Consulate of the Caesars,
294.
17. The Same, and the Caesars, to Mardonius.
No one can be compelled to act as attorney against his consent, or to do so
longer than is stated in the instrument giving him authority; and he is not
obliged to undertake the defence of an absent party, as it is sufficient for
him to carry out that with which he was entrusted.
Given at Philippopolis, on the sixth of the Nonesof July, during the Consulate
of Diocletian, Consul for the fifth time, and Maximian, 294.
18. The Same, and the Consuls, to Dionysia.
To undertake the legal defence of another is a masculine duty, and it is
settled that it cannot be discharged by one of the female sex;1 and therefore
you must apply for the appointment of a guardian for your son, if he is a
minor.
Given on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 294.
19. The Same, and the Caesars, to Firmus.
Where you have paid the price of a tract of land, or a slave, to an agent who
sold it to you without the order of the owner of the same, and the consent of
the latter neither preceded nor followed the contract of sale; and the
Governor, after proper investigation,
1 "Fminae ab omnibus officiis civilibus, vel publicis remotae sunt; ei ideo nec
judices esse possunt, nec magistratum gerere, nec postulare, nec pro alio
intervenire, nec procuratores existere." ED.
should ascertain that the price of said property has been employed for the
benefit of the owner, he shall order it to be returned to you.
Given on the day before the Idesof March, during the Consulate of the Caesars,
294.
20. The Same to Verrinus, Governor of Syria.
We hold that it makes no difference whether the business was transferred to the
care of the attorney before or after legal proceedings were instituted.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of Demessus.
21. The Emperor Constantine to the Council of the Province of Africa.
A husband has a perfect right to undertake the management of the affairs of his
wife without any mandate, where he furnishes security in a proper manner, and
observes the other requisite formalities; in order that women, in the attempt
to conduct their cases, may not, by being bold, incur contempt for the modesty
of their sex, and be compelled to appear in the assemblies of men, or in court.
If, however, anyone should undertake to execute a mandate, even though he be a
husband, he cannot exceed what his power of attorney prescribes.
Given on the fourth of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Constantine
and Licinius Caesar, both Consuls for the second time, 312.
22. The Same to Bassus, Urban Prefect.
Where attorneys have been appointed, and are charged with the conduct of a case
after the joinder of issue, those who authorize them to do so have no power to
take an active part in the proceedings, unless deadly enmity should arise
between them, or other motives should exist, or some necessary cause arise; for
then the case can be transferred to them, even against the consent of the
attorneys.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of
Constantine and Licinius-Caesar, 312.
23. The Emperor Julianus to Secundus, Praetorian Prefect.
There is no doubt that, after the case has been brought into court, and the
attorney obtains control of the same, it can be conducted to a conclusion, even
after the death of the party who directed the action to be brought or defended;
and the ancient jurists have even held that he can, in this instance, appoint
an attorney.
Given on the second of the Nonesof February, during the Consulate of Julianus,
Consul for the fourth time, and Sallust, 363.
24. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Pancratius, Urban
Prefect.
Even though the authority of the attorney should be established in the
beginning of the action, and it should be shown that he has
been directed by the principal in the action to take charge of it, still, if
the authority of the attorney is ascertained to be fraudulent, the controversy
is not usually decided, nor will a judgment, if rendered, stand.
Given at Constantinople, on the second of the Kalendsof April, during the
Consulate of Antoninus and Syagrius, 382.
25. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius, to Tatian, Praetorian
Prefect.
Where anyone has attained the dignity of Praetor, Prefect of the City, General
of the Army, Count of the Consistory, or has dispensed justice as Proconsul, or
administered public affairs as Imperial Vicegerent, and an action is to be
brought or defended by him, he has the right to appoint an attorney to
represent him.
If anyone transgresses the provisions of this law, and suit is brought against
him, he shall lose his case if he did not make provision for its defence by an
attorney; and any judge who violates them is warned that he will be compelled
to pay twenty pounds of gold, and that the same amount shall be exacted from
his subordinates.
Given on the eighteenth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of
Arcadius, Consul for the second time, and Rufinus, 392.
Extract from Novel 71, Chapter I. Latin Text.
This decree only has reference to illustrious persons, for others are subject
to the Common Law.
26. The Emperors Arcadius, Honorius, and Theodosius to Anthemius, Praetorian
Prefect.
In pecuniary disputes, even though no rule or decree may have been formulated
on this point, We grant power to everyone, indiscriminately, to answer by an
attorney, if he prefers to do so; unless for some good reason, or where matters
are urgent, the judge requires him to appear in person.
Given on the day before the Idesof October.


TITLE XIV.
PERSONS IN AUTHORITY ARE NOT PERMITTED TO APPOINT ADVOCATES FOR LITIGANTS, OP
TO HAVE THEIR RIGHTS OP ACTION TRANSFERRED TO THEM.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Aristobolus.
Our Father, the Divine Claudius, who was thoroughly learned in the law, very
properly decided that those who committed their defence to persons in authority
should be punished with the loss of their cases; in order that suits might be
determined on their merits, rather than by the influence of powerful persons.
It is clear that he intended that, in actions in which people of the provinces
were interested, the
Governors should be charged with the punishment of violations of this law, and
that they should impose severe sentences upon the agents or attorneys who had
been employed in such matters either through favor, or by the payment of money;
and therefore as it is to the interest of all, and especially to that of those
in moderate circumstances, who are often oppressed by the unfortunate
interference of persons in authority, you must hear the applications of the
litigants, and not fear that you may involve persons of high rank; as the
Divine Claudius specially decided that the Governors of provinces should decide
questions of this kind, and if circumstances demanded it, should inflict
punishment.
Given on the fourth of the Idesof September, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors, one Consul for the third time, and the other Consul for the
second time, 287.
2. The Emperors Arcadius, Honorius, and Theodosius to John, Praetorian Prefect.
If rights of action of this kind should be transferred to powerful persons, the
creditors shall be punished with the loss of their claims; for the rapacity of
creditors becomes apparent when they assign their rights of action to others.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof July, during the Consulate of Honorius, Consul
for the seventh time, and Theodosius, Consul for the second time, 407.


TITLE XV.
CONCERNING THOSE WHO PLACE UPON THEIR LANDS
PAPERS BEARING THE NAMES OP POWERFUL PERSONS, OR
WHO MAKE USE OF THE NAMES OF SUCH PERSONS IN
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
1. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Messala, Praetorian Prefect.
We have been informed that there are many individuals who, aware of the
desperation of their unjust claims, make use of the names of powerful persons,
and the privileges of those invested with the highest rank, in opposition to
the parties by whom they are summoned to court; and in order to prevent fraud
being committed against the laws, and adversaries from being terrified by the
abuse of such names and titles, We decree that those who, knowingly, connive at
a deception of this kind, shall be branded with infamy; but if they have not
given them their consent, and papers or documents containing their names have
been affixed to the houses of others, without their knowledge, those who are
guilty shall be scourged, and sentenced to perpetual labor in the mines.
Therefore, when any defendant who is the possessor of the property in dispute
and of the title to the same, and can plead a properly formulated exception in
opposition to the claim brought against him, and who believes that the name of
another has been inserted in the petition or complaint of the plaintiff; the
latter
shall be punished by the loss of the possession, or of the case which he
attempted to gain or avoid by means of this fraud, and he shall not have the
power to bring his action a second time, even if the merits of the case appear
to be on his side; and those who voluntarily permit their names to be used in
the actions of others, when they themselves have no right either of possession
or ownership, shall be branded with infamy as persons who have thrown away
their reputations, and are the purchasers of fraudulent litigation.
Given at Milan, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof December, during the
Consulate of Stilicho and Aurelian, 400.
TITLE XVI.
No PRIVATE PERSON SHALL PLACE THE IMPERIAL INSIGNIA UPON HIS OWN PREMISES OR
UPON THOSE OF ANOTHER, OR SHALL RAISE THE IMPERIAL STANDARD OVER THEM.
1. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Flavianus, Praetorian Prefect.
It is the exclusive privilege of Imperial Majesty that Our houses and
possessions should be indicated by the display of Our titles, and therefore let
all persons know that everything upon which Our name appears becomes public
property.
Given at Ravenna, on the third of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate
of Bassus and Philip, 408.
2. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Florentius, Praetorian Prefect.
Let no one presume to raise the royal standard or insignia upon the land of
another, without the order of a competent judge, no matter who the person may
be, or under what title he holds possession; even though it may be established
that he is not the owner, or an unjust possessor, or a rash trespasser, who has
possession of the property. We decree that if he who does this is a plebeian,
he shall be subjected to the extreme penalty; if he is a man of illustrious
rank, a decurion, a soldier, or a member of the clergy, his property shall be
confiscated, and he shall not only be deported from the City of Rome, but he
shall also be deprived of his freedom, and all judges shall see that this law
is executed.
We grant authority not only to those to the injury of whom an act of this kind
has been committed, in violation of right and of the laws, but to all their
children and slaves, without the fear of false accusation or of prosecution for
crime, to remove or deface the insignia, and even to destroy the standards
above mentioned; and We also decree that the judges and their subordinates
shall be fined thirty pounds of gold, if they permit an accusation of this kind
to be made, or anyone to sign it.
Given on the fifteenth day of July, during the Consulate of Theodosius, Consul
for the seventeenth time, and Festus, 439.


TITLE XVII.
No ONE SHALL BE PERMITTED TO PLACE A SEAL UPON PROPERTY BELONGING TO ANOTHER,
WITHOUT THE AUTHORITY OP A JUDGE.
1. The Emperor Probus to Octavius.
It has been frequently stated in Rescripts that, before judgment has been
rendered, a seal cannot be attached to property in the possession of another;
and therefore you are permitted to break seals which have been unlawfully
placed upon property or crops in your possession, so that after they have been
removed, the action which has been brought against you may be decided.
Given on the fourth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Probus,
Consul for the second time, and Lupus, 278.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Crangasius.
No one can attach his seal to property which is in the possession of another,
even if he alleges that the said property is his, or has been encumbered to
him.


TITLE XVIII.
NEITHER THE TREASURY NOR THE STATE SHALL PROVIDE AN ATTORNEY TO DEFEND ANYONE
IN COURT.
1. The Emperor Gordian to Legitimus and Others.
You are making a request contrary to the rule of law, when you ask that the
State shall assist you, under the pretext that you owe it a certain sum of
money.
Given on the third of the Idesof January, during the Consulate of Gordian,
Consul for the second time, and Pompeianus, 242.
2. The Same to Tertullus.
When you state that you are willing to give to the Treasury half of certain
property, or half of the interest in an action which you are entitled to bring,
you are notified that the discipline enforced during My reign does not permit a
donation of this kind to be accepted; and therefore, your right, if you have
one, must be exercised in accordance with the usual legal formalities, without
subjecting My Treasury to odium.
Given on the sixth of the Nonesof August, during the Consulate of Gordian,
Consul for the second time, and Pompeianus, 242.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Amphio.
It is repugnant to the laws of Our reign for the Treasury to provide an
attorney against private persons, under the pretext of a debt which is due to
it.
Given at Philippopolis, on the eighth of the Kalendsof January, under the
Consulate of the Caesars, 294.
4. The Same, and the Caesars, to Achilles.
It is not proper to ask, contrary to the peace of Our reign, that, for the
purpose of defrauding creditors, Our Treasury shall be subjected to obloquy.
Therefore pay what you owe to Our Treasury, and if suit is brought against you
by your creditor to recover a sum of money which you deny has ever been paid to
you, you can, according to the law, avail yourself of an exception on the
ground that the money had not been counted out to you.
Given on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 294.


TITLE XIX.
CONCERNING THE ACTION BASED ON VOLUNTARY AGENCY.


1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Sopatra.
As you have accused the guardians of your children as being liable to
suspicion, and as you request that guardians or curators shall be appointed for
them, you have performed the duty dictated by affection, and therefore the
action of voluntary agency will not lie in order to enable you to recover the
expense which you have incurred in this proceeding; for when anyone has made
disbursements for others through family attachment, he cannot, under any
circumstances, recover them.
Given on the third of the Nonesof October, during the Consulate of Dexter and
Priscus, 197.

2. The Same to Rufina.
It has been established for the benefit of minors that if anyone has transacted
their business to their advantage, when the necessity was urgent, an action
should be granted against them to the extent to which they may have profited.
The expense which you allege you have incurred in behalf of the minor by taking
him to Rome for the purpose of having guardians appointed for him, is granted
you by law; if his maternal aunt does not prove that she was ready to have this
done on her own responsibility.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of Lateranus
and Rufinus, 198.

3. The Same to Hadrian.
If you have paid a sum of money for your brother, who is your co-heir, you can
avail yourself of the action based on voluntary agency, and if you have been
compelled to pay a debt in full, for the purpose of releasing a pledge, you
will be entitled to bring this action; or you can collect what is due to you by
a suit in partition, if
judgment has not already been rendered in an action of this kind brought
between you.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of Anulinus
and Fronto, 200.

4. The Same to Claudius.
Anyone who undertakes to transact the business of a minor, by the direction of
her guardian, is not considered to have done so in the place of her guardian,
but he will be liable to the ward in an action based on voluntary agency.
Given on the third of the Nonesof December, during the Consulate of Fabianus
and Mutianus, 202.

5. The Same to Triphonius.
Where a freedman has transacted the business of a daughter of his patron as a
mark of respect, he will not have the right to bring an action against her on
the ground of voluntary agency.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Geta and
Plautian, 204.

6. The Same to Gallus.
You say that a curator was appointed for you by your father's will, which does
not appear to have been legally done; and if (as you allege), he has interfered
with the administration of the estate, an action on the ground of voluntary
agency will lie in your favor against him as well as his heirs.
Given during the Consulate of Aper and Maximus, 208.

7. The Emperor Antoninus to Euphrata.
Where you have been appointed heir to two-twelfths of his estate by the person
who transacted your business; even if you should enter upon the estate, you
will be entitled to a suit against your co-heir to recover the remaining ten-
twelfths, provided you had this right of action against the deceased.
Given at Rome, on the sixth of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of
Sabinus and Anulinus, 217.

8. The Same to Sallust.
If Julian collected a sum of money from your debtor and you ratified the
payment of the same, you will be entitled to an action against him on the
ground of business transacted.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Praesens and
Extricatus.

9. The Same, and the Caesars, to Severus.
You have a right to bring the civil suit based on voluntary agency against
those who have administered your affairs, and your rights will not be
prejudiced if you have delayed bringing it because you belong to the army, as
this kind of an action is only extinguished by the prescription of long time.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulship of Antoninus
and Aventus, 219.

10. The Emperor Alexander to Secundus and Others.
If you take care of a sick slave belonging to another, who is known to be
useful to his master, you have transacted business for the latter to his
advantage, and you can recover your expenses by this action.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of
Alexander, Consul for the second time, and Marcellus, 227.

11. The Same to Herennia.  You have no good reason to ask that the
expense of the maintenance which you have furnished your children
shall be repaid to you, as by doing so, you have only discharged the
obligation demanded by maternal affection. If, however, you have
expended any money for the advantage, or probable benefit of their
business, and can prove that your act was not prompted by your
generosity as a mother, but with the intention of being reimbursed for
what you paid, you can collect it by means of the action based on
voluntary agency.  Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof February,
during the Consulate of Albinus and Maximus, 231.

12. The Same to Theophilus.
'If a son should discharge a debt for his father, he will not be entitled to an
action to recover the amount which he paid, whether he was under paternal
control at the time he made the payment, or was independent, provided he paid
the money as a donation; and therefore, if your father, being his own master
and transacting business for his father, paid his debt without having been
directed to do so, you can bring an action on the ground of voluntary agency,
against your paternal uncles.
Given on the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Agricola
and Clement, 225.
13. The Same to Aquilia.
You cannot recover from your father-in-law any expenses which you have incurred
on account of your wife's illness, as you should have expended the money
because of your affection for her. You have, however, a legal right to bring
suit for her funeral expenses against her father, to whom her dowry was given,
if you paid them with the intention of recovering them.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of Agricola
and Clement, 231.
14. The Same to Mutianus Rufus.
If you obeyed the mandate of the husband alone, and transacted his business as
well as that of his wife, an action will lie in your favor as well as in that
of the wife, on the ground of business transacted; and the husband who directed
you to do this will be entitled
to the action on mandate against you, and you also can bring the counter action
against him to recover any expenses which you may have incurred.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and Urbanus, 225.
15. The Emperor Gordian to Eutychiamis.
If, influenced by paternal affection, you have furnished means of support to
your daughter-in-law, or have paid out money as salaries to teachers, you will
have no right to recover such expenses. Where, however, you have expended
anything for your daughter-in-law with the intention of recovering it, you will
have the right to bring an action on the ground of voluntary agency.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof July, during the Consulate of Gordian and
Aviola, 240.
16. The Emperors Gallus and Volusianus to Eutychianus.
If, while transacting your sister's business, you paid any taxes for her,
either by her direction, or because she requested you to do so, you can recover
what you prove that you paid, by an action based on voluntary agency or by the
action of mandate.
Given on the eleventh of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Gallus and
Volusianus, 240.
17. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Claudia.
The successors of a curator, who have been sued in an equitable action based on
voluntary agency, are liable for fraud as well as gross negligence; but they
are not obliged to continue the administration, and therefore it is established
that they have no authority to alienate any property belonging to the ward.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the above-mentioned
Consulate, 293.
18. The Same, and the Caesars, to Pomponius.
Good faith requires the payment of interest on expenses incurred in transacting
the business of others, and you have also the right to bring this action
against those whose affairs you allege you have been compelled to transact.
Given on the ninth of the Kalendsof January, during the above-named Consulate,
293.
19. The Same, and the Caesars, to Alexander.
Where property owned in common, which forms part of an estate, is sold by one
of the heirs, his co-heir, who has ratified the sale, can bring an action
against him on the ground of voluntary agency, to recover his share of the
price.
20. The Same, and the Caesars, to Octaviana.Anyone who, without a mandate,
attends to the business of another, is not considered to resemble a guardian or
curator, as the latter
necessarily cease to administer their trust when their duties are ended, but
the former can relinquish his whenever he chooses; and he performs his duty
sufficiently and thoroughly if he consults the interest of his friend in one or
more transactions.
In accordance with this, where anyone voluntarily manages the property of
another, when he is neither his guardian nor his curator, as he is responsible
not only for fraud and gross negligence but also for slight negligence, he can
be sued by you, and compelled to return with interest what is proved to be due
from him to you; but so far as others who are indebted to you are concerned, he
will not be liable, because he cannot proceed against them on account of the
exception which may be interposed; and therefore you should prosecute your
claims against those who you say are indebted to you.
21. The Same, and the Caesars, to Michra.
If your blood-relatives have manumitted their slaves, and you assert that they
have managed your property, this is no reason why their freedom should not be
granted. Moreover, there is no doubt that you cannot bring suit to recover
them, after their manumission, on account of some act which was not connected
with the management of the property either before or after their liberation,
but was distinct from it.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof October, under the Consulate
of the Caesars, 264.
22. The Same, and the Caesars, to Eulogius.
Those who transact the business of others cannot be held liable for accidents,
in the absence of any special agreement providing for it.
Given on the eleventh of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 364.
23. The Same, and the Caesars, to Theodore.
The action based on voluntary agency is not a real, but a personal one.
Given at Nicomedia, on the twelfth of the Kalendsof December, during the
Consulate of the Caesars, 264.
24. The Emperor Justinian to John.
Where anyone has interfered with the administration of the affairs of another,
against the consent of the owner of the property, who has even forbidden him to
do so, a doubt is entertained by certain eminent authorities whether such a
person has a right to bring suit against the said owner to recover expenses
which he had incurred with reference to it; and some of them declare that a
direct or an equitable action can be brought by him, and others (among whom was
Salvius Julianus), deny that this can be done, but now We, in deciding the
question, and in accordance with the opinion of Julianus, order that if the
owner of the property was opposed to the other transacting his business, and
forbade him to do so, he can bring
neither a direct nor an equitable action against him; that is to say, after
notice had been given him by the owner that he did not authorize him to attend
to his affairs, even though he may have done so advantageously. Then, if the
owner should find that a considerable amount of money had been properly
expended, and fraudulently pretending not to be aware of it, he should forbid
the party in question to transact his business, in order to prevent him from
being reimbursed his expenses previously incurred, We, by no means, suffer this
to be done, but direct that no action will lie in his favor to recover money
spent for improvements, after the time when he was notified, whether this was
done in writing or not, where other persons were called to witness that the
notice was given; and with reference to expenses previously incurred, if they
were beneficial, We permit the agent to bring suit against the owner in the
ordinary way.
Given on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of
Lampadius and Orestes, 538.



TITLE XX.
CONCERNING ACTS PERFORMED THROUGH THE INFLUENCE OF FORCE OR FEAR.

1. The Emperor Alexander to Felix.
The opinion has been given that the right to pursue property which has been
taken by violence or theft, even if it has been afterwards destroyed, remains
unimpaired under the law.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and Ælianus, 224.

2. The Same to Alexander.
As you acknowledge that you not only gave security to pay a sum of money, but
that you also have paid it, it is not clear why you ask that it shall be
returned to you because you have been subjected to violence, when it is not
probable that you would have hastened to make payment without complaining that
the note was forcibly extorted, unless you allege that you also suffered
violence when you paid the money.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Alexander,
Consul for the eleventh time, and Marcellus, 227.

3. The Emperor Gordian to Gaius.
Where your grandfather was compelled, either by force or fear, to sell a
certain tract of land, and then the purchaser sold it to another, if you have
become the heir of your grandfather, you have a right to appear before the
Governor of the province, and petition that the land be restored to you, after
the price has been returned; since it has been decided that, in a case of this
kind, a real action should be granted in accordance with the terms of the
Perpetual Edict, provided the person who purchased the land in the second place
cannot rely upon the prescription of long-continued possession.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof August, during the Consulate of Pius and
Pontianus, 239.

4. The Same to Primus and Enthydicus.
If a sale is extorted from you either by force, or the fear of death or bodily
injury, and your consent was not afterwards given to it, and you bring suit
within a year in accordance with the terms of the Perpetual Edict (during which
time you have a right to proceed), and the property is not restored to you, you
can recover a judgment for quadruple damages; of course, after having returned
the purchase-money. When a year has elapsed, however, if proper cause is shown,
the same action can be brought for simple damages, but it has been decided that
this suit will only be available where another will not lie.
Given on the third of the Nonesof August, during the Consulate of Gordian and
Aviola, 240.

5. The Same to the Soldier Rufus.
It makes no difference by whom violence has been exerted against your father
and your paternal uncle to compel them to sell their property, or whether force
or fear has been employed by the purchaser or by someone else with his
knowledge, for if they were impelled by violence to sell their property for
less than it was worth, they can cause what has been improperly done to be
restored to its former condition.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of Gordian
and Aviola, 294.

6. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Pollia.
It is not necessary for any office which a man may hold to cause him injury;
therefore, you are advised that the senatorial dignity of your adversary is not
alone sufficient to cause the fear by which you allege the contract has been
entered into.
Given at Heraclea, on the third of the Kalendsof May, under the Consulate of
the Caesars, 294.

7. The Same, and the Caesars, to Cotus.
If you can prove in the presence of the Governor of the province that an
instrument calling for a donation, a compromise, a stipulation, or any other
kind of an obligation or contract, has been extorted by the fear of death or
bodily injury, or through apprehension caused by threats of death, he will not,
in accordance with the terms of the Edict, suffer the contract to stand.
Given on the second of the Nones ofJanuary, during the same Consulate, 299.

8. The Same, and the Caesars, to Tryphoninus.
As you have sold your house and garden with the expectation of recovering an
obligation which you have executed with reference to
certain grain, and you allege that you only agreed to the said sale for fear of
not being appointed to civil office, and that you now wish to rescind the sale
under the pretext that it was made through fear, understand that apprehension
of this kind will be of no advantage to you for the purpose of annulling such a
contract.
Given on the eleventh of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 300.

9. The Same, and the Caesars, to Hymnoda.
It is established that fear must not only be proved by threats and disputes,
but by the violence of the act.
Given on the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the Caesars, 300.

10. The Same and the Caesars, to Faustina.
You ask that an alienation or a promise which has been made through fear of
prosecution which has been begun against you, or which may be brought
hereafter, shall be rescinded, and this is an improper request.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 302.

11. The Emperor Constantine to Evagrius, Praetorian Prefect.
If anyone, merely apprehensive of the influence of a person holding an
office of trifling importance, should be induced to sell him property
belonging to himself, situated in the same province or place where he
is discharging the duties of his office, what has been purchased shall
be returned, and the purchase-money may even be retained; and those
who have acquired anything by extortion through making an improper use
of the names of their wives and friends shall be liable to a similar
penalty.  Given at Aquileia on the Kalendsof October, during the
Consulate of Constantius, Consul for the seventh time, and the Caesar
Constantine, 353.

12. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to the People.
We order that all sales, donations and compromises which have been extorted by
the improper exercise of authority shall be void.1
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of the
Same Emperors; the first, Consul for the eighth time, and the second, Consul
for the third time, 409.
1 The ancient Hindus had well-defined ideas of the illegality of whatever was
obtained by duress: "What is given by force to a man who cannot accept it
legally, what is by force enjoyed, by force caused to be written; and all other
things done by force or against free consent, Menu has pronounced void." (Sir
Wm. Jones Works, The Laws of Menu III, Page 299.)  ED.
TITLE XXI. CONCERNING FRAUD.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Clementina.
When a surety, having paid the amount of the debt and interest, purchases the
pledges from the creditor, he ought to restore to you the ownership of the
same, together with any profits which he may have honestly collected, in order
to avoid exposing himself to an action for fraud arising from breach of faith.
Given on the third of the Idesof May, during the Consulship of Plautian and
Geta, 294.
2. The Emperor Antoninus to Agrippa.
The action for fraud is permitted, after proper cause is shown, when no other
will lie.
Given on the Nonesof November, during the Consulate of Gentian and Bassus, 212.
3. The Emperor Gordian to Aquilinus.
The delays which are usually granted in an action for fraud cannot be counted
against you while you were engaged in business for the State (which you allege
is the case), as the time will only commence to run against you from the day on
which, having been released from your official duties, you began to have the
power to act within the prescribed time.
Dated on the Idesof August, during the Consulate of Sabinus, Consul for the
second time, and Venustus, 241.
4. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Menander.
As you state that it was agreed between yourself and the person who you say had
formed a connection with a female slave that he should give you a male slave in
her stead, you understand that if you have manumitted her, or have delivered
her to him, and he has manumitted her, you have not the power to revoke her
freedom; but if the time has not yet expired, and the other party has violated
the contract, you can ask that an action for fraud be granted you.
If, however, you still have the ownership of the said slave, and you should
appear before the Governor of the province, you can recover her with her
children, if no question should arise as to her status.
Given at Heraclea on the third of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of
the Caesars, 294.
5. The Same, and the Caesars, to Amphidrosa.
If you, through emancipation, have become your own master, during the lifetime
of your father, and have succeeded to the estate of your mother, and have
compromised with your father in good faith,
and he, after having administered your property as your lawful guardian, has
manumitted you, you are advised that if a simple agreement has been made
between you, your claim will be barred by an exception, but if a novation has
been concluded with the proper formalities, and a release has followed, you
will not be entitled to any action. Where, however, you have been greatly
injured by the exercise of the deliberation solemnly accorded by you for the
novation and release, an action for fraud will not lie in your favor, as this
would be contrary to the respect which you owe to your father, but you should
be granted an action in factum.
Given on the Idesof June, during the Consulate of the Caesars, 294.
6. The Same, and the Caesars, to Hymnoda.
Fraud must be proved by convincing evidence.1Given on the Kalendsof December,
during the Consulate of the Caesars, 294.
7. The Same, and the Caesars, to Sebastian.
If, when you are more than twenty-five years of age, you reject the estate of
your brother, you will not, under any circumstances, have the power to enter
upon it; but if you have been induced to do so by the fraudulent conduct of his
widow, who has been substituted for you, you can bring the action against her.
Given on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
8. The Emperor Constantine to Symmachus, Vicegerent.
We have thought it best that the term of a year, during which the action for
fraud can be instituted, should not begin to run from the day on which anyone
alleges that he has learned that fraud has been committed, nor within the
available time of the year, but rather from the date on which the fraud is said
to have been committed, within the term of two consecutive years, whether the
person who complains that he has been the victim of fraud was absent, or
present. Therefore, all persons are hereby notified that permission is not
given to
1 This is in accordance with the English and American rule that fraud must be
established by clear and positive proof, for while legal or constructive fraud
may exist, it is never presumed (Dolum non nisi perspicuis indiciis probari
convenit)except when the nature and circumstances of the case render such a
conclusion inevitable.
The Common Law doctrine relating to fraud has undoubtedly been borrowed from
the Roman jurists. It was long, however, before the evil effect of fraudulent
representations were recognized as actionable in England. "In the thirteenth
century our kings' court had in general no remedy for the man who to his damage
had trusted to the word of a liar."
"Our law, though willing to admit in vague phrase that no one should be
suffered to gain anything by fraud, (Et fraus et dolus nemini debent
patraeinari),was inclined to hold that a man has himself to thank if he is
misled by deceit; 'It is his folly.' " (Pollock and Maitland, History of
English Law, Vol. I, Pages 535/536.)  ED.
begin the action after the term of two years has elapsed, or before the
complete term of two years has begun; but it should be terminated before the
expiration of the said two years.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of
Constantine, and the Caesar Licinius, 319.
TITLE XXII.
CONCERNING COMPLETE RESTITUTION GRANTED TO MINORS OF THE AGE OF TWENTY-FIVE
YEARS.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Plotiana.
It must be ascertained whether the complaint of inofficiousness has been openly
or tacitly renounced, and this does not show that you are entitled to this
privilege, although it is granted to a minor.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof July, during the Consulate of Maximus, Consul
for the second time, and Ælianus, 224.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Alexander.
If at the time when your sister was entitled to relief as a minor she enjoyed
the right to accept possession of the estate of your father, who died
intestate, she will, none the less, enjoy this privilege conferred by the
Edict, although she may have had five living children, provided she is still of
the age permitted her to obtain the benefit of restitution.
Given on the eighth of the Idesof August, during the Consulate of Pius and
Pontianus, 339.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to . Attianus.
If you, having a curator, and being under twenty-five years of age, should,
after having reached your majority, sell your property, this contract should
not be carried out; for a minor who has a curator does not differ from one for
whom a curator has been appointed by the Praetor, and has been forbidden to
dispose of his estate. Where, however, you made the contract without having a
curator, you will not, after proper cause has been shown, be forbidden to
petition for complete restitution, if the time prescribed by law has not yet
expired.
Given at Heraclea, on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof May, during the above-
mentioned Consulate, 293.
4. The Same, and the Caesars, to Isidor.
If you can prove that you were a minor under the age of twenty-five years when
you made the contract, and it is not established by your adversary that the
time prescribed for claiming restitution has elapsed, the Governor of the
province should grant you the relief of complete restitution.
Given at Heraclea, on the sixth of the Kalendsof May, during the above-
mentioned Consulate, 293.
5. The Same, and the Caesars, to Rufus.
Minors are entitled to complete restitution where they can show that advantage
has been taken of them, even if the fraud of their adversary is not proved; and
it is a positive rule of law that they can demand complete restitution with
reference to matters in which they think advantage has been taken of them, even
before they have reached their twenty-fifth year.
Given at Heraclea, on the fifth of the Kalendsof May, during the same
Consulate, 293.
6. The Same, and the Caesars, to Sententia.
If proceedings to obtain the benefit of complete restitution have been begun
within the age during which such relief is ordinarily granted, and it has not
been renounced by you, the death of the person of whom you made the demand
cannot cause you any damage.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of the Caesars,
294.
7. The Same, and the Caesars, to Severa.
If you obtained your release from the guardianship of your uncle by false
representation of your age, his office of guardian, as well as his blood-
relationship indicating that he was not ignorant of it, you can, for this
reason, bring an action for complete restitution against his heirs, if the time
prescribed by law has not yet expired.
Given on the eleventh of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of the
Ca3sars, 274.
8. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Julianus, Proconsul of Africa.
It has been established by innumerable authorities that the interests of minors
must be consulted, whether they have been guilty of negligence, or have failed
to act through ignorance.
Given on the Nonesof May, during the Consulate of Constantius, 420.
9. The Emperor Zeno to Ælianus.
A minor is not considered to have been taken advantage of who avails himself of
the Common Law.
Given on the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of Basilius, 420.
TITLE XXIII.
CONCERNING COMPLETE RESTITUTION IN THE CASE OF A MINOR UNDER PARENTAL CONTROL.
1. The Emperor Gordian to the Soldier Tripho.
When a son under paternal control, who is a minor of twenty-five years of age,
becomes surety for a stranger, he is not prevented from petitioning for
complete restitution; and if he should become surety
for his father, he can still demand it, even though he may not succeed to his
estate at his death.
Given on the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Gordian, Consul for the
second time, and Pompeianus, 242.
2. The Same to the Soldier Gaudentius.
If your brother, who is under the control of your father, should borrow a sum
of money, and does not make the contract by order of his father or contrary to
the Decree of the Senate, he can, on account of the weakness of his age, demand
complete restitution, notwithstanding his obligation.
Given on the third of the Nonesof October, during the Consulate of Pius and
Pontianus.
TITLE XXIV. CONCERNING THE SURETIES OP MINORS.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Miro.
After you have obtained complete restitution through the privilege due to your
age, you will not be compelled to assume the risk of the eviction of the
purchaser, to whom you sold the land which formed part of your father's estate,
but those who became sureties for you cannot be released for this reason; and
therefore, if they paid the money, or have been ordered by the court to do so,
you can be sued in an action on mandate, provided you have not obtained the
benefit of restitution against the sureties also.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of Severus
and Albinus, 195.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Curio.
If she who sold you her property obtains relief on the ground of her age, by
means of a decree rendered by the Governor, there is no doubt that the person
who became security for her will be obliged to carry out the contract; but if
the contract should appear to have been obtained through intentional fraud, it
is clearly a principle of law that, in granting relief, the interest of the
vendor, as well as that of her surety, should be taken into consideration.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Diocletian,
Consul for the second time, and Maximian, 287.
TITLE XXV.
WHERE A GUARDIAN OR A CURATOR INTERPOSES TO OBTAIN COMPLETE RESTITUTION.
1. Antoninus to Martiana and Others.
If you had arrived at puberty when you entered upon the estate of both your
parents, and you are still at that age, you have a right to obtain the benefit
of complete restitution on account of the obligation which you contracted with
reference to the estates of your par-
ents, if you can appear before the Governor of the province; but if you have
attained your majority, and have allowed the time to elapse during which you
could have obtained complete restitution, sue your curators in an action in
accordance to the rules of law, if you have not already proceeded against them.
Given on the second of the Nonesof April, during the Consulate of Laetus and
Caerealus, 216.
2. The Emperor Alexander to Martiana.
It has been decided that minors of twenty-five years of age can obtain the
benefit of complete restitution, if they have been overreached with reference
to matters which have been transacted, either judicially or extra judicially,
in the presence of their guardians or curators.
Given on the third of the Nonesof March, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and Aquilinus, 224.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Nicomedus.
It has already been decided that the benefit of complete restitution can be
accorded to minors in matters which their guardians or curators can be proved
to have improperly administered, although they can recover what they are
entitled to from their guardians or curators by means of a personal action.
Given on the fourth of the Nonesof May, during the Consulate of Maximus and
Aquilinus, 286.
4. The Same, and the Caesars, to Isidor.
If a creditor, not relying upon you personally but upon your curators, makes a
contract with them, and they stipulate with him, it is clear that no action
will lie in his favor against you.
Given at Heraclea on the fifth of the Kalendsof May, during the above-mentioned
Consulate, 291.
5. The Same, and the Caesars, to Valentinus.
It has been decided that even where guardians or curators have sold property,
or have made contracts of some other description, the minors can either have
their own property restored, or obtain damages from their guardians or
curators, and that their rights shall not be prejudiced, no matter which method
they may select.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof December, during the Consulate of the Caesars,
164.
TITLE XXVI.
WHERE COMPLETE RESTITUTION OF PROPERTY OWNED IN COMMON IS DEMANDED.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Aphobius and
Others.
Even though your sister may have been more than twenty-five years of age she
can, under no circumstances, deprive you of any of
your rights, where you did not give her authority to do so, or subsequently
ratify the transaction. If, however, you, knowing what she has done, should,
after having reached the age of twenty-five years, give your consent to it,
although she, if still a minor, can apply for the relief of restitution, so far
as her own interest in the property is concerned, but her age will not be of
any advantage to you for the purpose of participation in the benefit of the
Perpetual Edict.
Given on the third of the Idesof August, during the Consulate of the Caesars,
264.
TITLE XXVII.
WHERE RESTITUTION IS DEMANDED IN A CASE IN WHICH A DECISION HAS BEEN RENDERED.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Viliiis.
Where you, in an action on guardianship, have obtained less than you were
entitled to, you can bring suit for the remainder, and the privilege due to
your age will be allowed, if you were a minor at the time when judgment was
rendered; but if this was done after you had attained your majority, you cannot
again make use of the same action to recover the same property.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of
Pompeianus and Pelignus.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Serena.
As your father alleges that you are still under his control, and that the
emancipation made by him is not valid, if the Proconsul, who has jurisdiction
of the case, should decide that you are still subject to his authority, and
you, in opposition to this decision, petition for complete restitution, the
Governor of the province, in taking cognizance of the case, shall render
judgment in conformity with the laws.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of Pius
and Pontianus.
3. The Emperor Philip to Æliana.
You can, by no means, obtain the benefit of complete restitution from the
Praetor or the illustrious Governor of the province, in opposition to the
decision of him who, at that time, represented the Emperor; for the Emperor
alone can grant restitution against the decision of anyone who acted as his
representative.
Given on the eighteenth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of
Philip and Titian, 246.
4. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Urbinius and Others.
As you allege that you are minors, and have not been defended, the Governor of
the province, according to his authority, shall see that your interests are not
prejudiced; but if judgment has been ren-
dered against you on any point, after a suitable defence has been made by your
guardians or curators, understand that it will be necessary for you to claim
the benefit of complete restitution; and the same rule will apply if the case
has been defended by your legally appointed attorney.
Given on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Maximus
and Aquilinus.
5. The Same, and the Caesars, to Martian.
It is established that minors or adults,1 can ask for restitution in matters in
which they are interested, where judgment has been rendered by the Governor
against their guardians and curators, just as if it had been rendered against
them personally.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof November, during the abovementioned
Consulate, 293.
TITLE XXVIII. CONCERNING RESTITUTION ON ACCOUNT OF A SALE.
1. The Emperor Alexander to the Soldier Florentius.
If you, a minor of twenty-five years of age, have given security to the
purchaser of land, which you sold to him, that you will not raise any
controversy with reference to the same, you ought not to expect, after having
taken an oath for the purpose of confirming the transaction, that I would
permit you to be guilty of perfidy or perjury.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof September ....
New Constitution of Frederick.
Oaths voluntarily made by persons who have arrived at puberty, to the effect
that they will not repudiate contracts made with reference to their property,
must be kept inviolate, but We order that those which have been extorted
through well-grounded apprehension, even from persons who are of age, and
especially where they swear that they will make no complaint of offences
committed against them, shall be of no effect.
2. The Emperors Constantine, Constantius, and Constans to the People.
There is no doubt that the law provides for complete restitution in favor of
minors where fictitious sales have been made, and fraudulent transactions
entered into by their guardians or curators.
Given on the Idesof August, during the Consulate of Constantius, Consul for the
first time, and Constans, 289.
1 An adult, at Civil Law, was a male child who had reached the age of fourteen
years, or a female who had reached the age of twelve; in other words, minors
who had passed the age of puberty.  ED.
TITLE XXIX.
WHERE RESTITUTION IS DEMANDED ON ACCOUNT OF THE SALE OF PLEDGES.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Sabina and Others.
It has already been decided that relief can also be given to minors against the
sale of pledges made by creditors, but only provided they have sustained great
injury. Therefore, if you can prove that you have suffered serious loss from
the sale of lands which have been hypothecated, and especially if you assert
that you are still minors, the benefit of restitution will be accorded you.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors, 293.
2. The Same, and the Caesars, to Severa and Clementina.
A creditor of your father having sold certain property of the latter which had
been pledged to him, you have no right to ask for the sale to be rescinded, and
restitution made on account of your age; and the rule is the same if you had
succeeded a stranger. If, however, the creditor did not act in good faith,
bring suit against him in the first place, or against your guardians and
curators, who permitted this sale to be effected.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof May, under the Consulate of the
Caesars, 294.
TITLE XXX.
WHERE RESTITUTION IS DEMANDED ON ACCOUNT OF A DONATION.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Theodora.
If any property was given you by your husband, who, at the time of your
betrothal, and before the celebration of your marriage, was under the age of
twenty-five years, and your curator was present, the donation cannot be revoked
under the pretext of want of age.
Given on the third of the Nonesof November, during the Consulate of Diocletian
and Aristobulus, 285.
2. The Same, and the Caesars, to Meda.
If your father, after having emancipated you, made a donation to your brother
and yourself, and afterwards transferred your brother's share to another, but
did not deprive you of anything, and your brother did not consent to the
donation by his father of a portion of the rustic estate, he cannot lose his
ownership of it on account of the authority of the Decree of the Senate; nor in
this case is the relief of complete restitution necessary.
With reference to any other property, however, which cannot be alienated
without a decree, if, after it had been given to him, he con-
sented, while still a minor, to its donation by his father, he can invoke the
benefit of restitution; provided the prescribed time for doing so has not
expired.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors, 293.
TITLE XXXI.
WHERE RESTITUTION IS DEMANDED ON ACCOUNT OF A GRANT OF FREEDOM.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Hamnia.
Where, after a decree has been rendered by the illustrious Praetor, by which he
decided that freedom was due under the terms of the trust, Secundus, whom you
allege has not complied with the condition upon which his liberation was
dependent, is not manumitted, your age as a minor will authorize a renewal of
judicial proceedings. If, however, you have granted him freedom, even though he
may not have been entitled to it, understand that you cannot revoke it, but
your curators will be required, in an action on voluntary agency, to indemnify
you for any damage which you may have sustained on this account.
Given on the second of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Lateranus
and Rufinus, 198.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Solanoa.
If (as you allege), you, a minor of twenty years of age, have manumitted your
slave, although you may have been fraudulently persuaded to do so, still, the
imposition of the rod by which freedom is lawfully bestowed cannot be rescinded
under the pretext of defect of age; the manumitted slave, however, must
indemnify you, and this should be provided for by the magistrate having
jurisdiction of the case to the extent that the law permits.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Gordian, Consul
for the second time, and Pompeianus, 242.
3. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus to Marona and Sabillina.
You ask that the slaves whom you have manumitted again be reduced to servitude,
alleging that you were at the time minors under the age of twenty, and that the
matter was not considered in council. You cannot obtain complete restitution,
but you can recover the property in accordance with law. If liberty was granted
on good grounds, complete restitution cannot be allowed to annul the grant; if,
however, you have been injured by the transaction through the negligence of
fraud of your freedman, or his curator, the Governor of the province shall see
that you are indemnified by whoever is responsible for it; and he must not
hesitate to inflict a more serious penalty upon the freedman if he should be
convicted of having openly and fraudulently committed a crime deserving of
punishment.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of
Secularis, Consul for the second time, and Donatus, 261.
4. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Tatian.
It cannot be doubted that where a decision has been rendered in favor of
freedom, in an action in which it is in question, it cannot be rescinded on the
ground of the privilege of minority without an appeal being taken.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof January, during the Consulate of the same
Emperors; the first, Consul for the fifth time, and the second, Consul for the
fourth time, 290.
TITLE XXXII.
WHERE A MINOR APPLIES FOR COMPLETE RESTITUTION AGAINST A COMPROMISE OR A
DIVISION OF PROPERTY.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Antony.
Where a female minor has obtained complete restitution, and a compromise or a
division of property has been rescinded, it has been decided that you can bring
the same action against her to which you were entitled in the first place.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors, 203.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Hymnoda.
If the relief of complete restitution on the ground of want of age is demanded
in the name of minors against a compromise, relief will also be granted to
anyone instituting judicial proceedings either by a reply to an exception based
on an agreement; or, if it should be established that the former obligation was
extinguished, your interests will be consulted by the revival of the action in
your favor.
Given on the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the above-mentioned
Emperors, 293.
TITLE XXXIII.
WHERE RESTITUTION IS DEMANDED ON ACCOUNT OF PAYMENT MADE BY THE GUARDIAN OF A
MINOR OR BY
HIMSELF.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Setorica.
Guardians who are indebted on account of their administration, and who pay what
they owe to curators, are released, just as other debtors are; but the benefit
of complete restitution against this pay-
ment is permitted by the Perpetual Edict, before the prescribed time has
elapsed; and it can be determined by investigation of the case whether or not
it should be granted.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof February, during the Consulate of the Caesars,
294.
2. The Same, and the Caesars, to Laurina.
It is reasonable that the right of recovery of a legacy which was not due
should be granted to a minor, even though it may have been paid by him through
an error of law; provided the time during which the relief of restitution can
be granted has not expired.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of the
above-named Emperors, 294.
TITLE XXXIV. WHERE RESTITUTION IS DEMANDED AGAINST A DOWRY.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Valens.
As you say that your sister was swindled when she gave all her property as her
dowry, the Governor of the province, in the presence of the adverse party,
shall ascertain whether your allegation is true, and whether the estate of your
sister or praetorian possession of her property belongs to you, if the time has
not yet elapsed within which you, as the representative of the deceased, are
permitted by the law to demand complete restitution.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof July, during the Consulate of Maximus and
Paternus, 234.
TITLE XXXV.
WHERE A MINOR APPLIES FOR RESTITUTION ON ACCOUNT OP A CRIME COMMITTED BY HIM.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Longinus.
In criminal cases, minors are not entitled to relief under the pretext of want
of age, for weakness of mind does not excuse the acts of evilly disposed
persons. If, however, the crime does not proceed from the mind, but from some
other source, the offender will not be liable to punishment, even where the
penalty involves the payment of a sum of money; hence, in cases of this kind,
minors are entitled to the benefit of complete restitution.
Given on the Idesof October, during the Consulate of Severus, Consul for the
second time, and Victorinus, 201.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Procula.
Although it is established that, in the case of crimes, no one is excusable on
account of his age, it is, however, proper that a mother
should not be refused succession to the estate of her children, when she was
responsible for not having had a guardian appointed for them, through an error
pardonable on account of her age, as this rule only applies to mothers who have
attained their majority.
Given on the fifth of the Nonesof March, during the Consulate of the Caesars,
294.
TITLE XXXVI.
WHERE A MINOR DEMANDS RESTITUTION BY WAY OF
RELIEF AGAINST USUCAPTION.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Isidor.
The benefit of restitution should be granted in favor of minors against those
who hold their property, when they acquire ownership of the same by usucaption.
Given on the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of the Caesars, 294.
TITLE XXXVII.
WHERE A MINOR DEMANDS RESTITUTION BY WAY OF RELIEF AGAINST THE TREASURY.
1. The Emperor Severus and Antoninus to Longinus.
If Probus, while a minor, was overreached by Rufinus, Our steward, and
contracted for the sale of property hastily and without proper consideration
for a price which was far too low, Our Treasury must obey the authority of
public law, and make complete restitution.
Given during the Consulate of Severus, Consul for the second time, and
Victorinus, 227.
2. The Emperor Alexander to Antiochus and Others.
If you and your brothers desire to obtain complete restitution against private
individuals, cognizance of the case should be taken by the Governor of the
province, who, after proper examination, must decide whether the relief which
you request shall be granted you. If, however, you have demanded restitution
against the Treasury, understand that you must appear before My representative,
sitting with the Governor in the presence of the Advocate of the Treasury.
Given on the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Alexander, Consul for
the second time, and Marcellus, 227.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Laurentius.
The exemption of the property of minors granted by the Edict of Our Father the
Divine Marcus does not apply to what you demand, as the sale of the property of
your minor father, or the alienation of your own property on account of a debt,
does not admit of the pre-
scription of five years; but, as you assert that your land was sold with your
slaves at a very low price, through the collusion or fraud of Our Fiscal Agent,
who was in office at that time, if Our present Fiscal Agent finds that your
allegations should be believed, and that the formalities requisite in a public
sale were complied with, and you pay the Treasury what is due to it, he must
rescind the sale, and order the land to be restored to you.
Given on the Idesof February, during the Consulate of the Caesars, 294.
TITLE XXXVIII.
WHERE A MINOR DEMANDS RESTITUTION BY WAY OF RELIEF AGAINST A CREDITOR.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Prunicus.
As you acknowledge that you made a contract with Zenodora, a minor under the
age of twenty-five years, and have not been able to prove before the
illustrious Praetor that she was pecuniarily benefited by the said contract, you
understand that it is but reasonable that she would obtain complete
restitution.
Given on the sixth of the Nonesof August, during the Consulate of Largus and
Messalinus, 148.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Caianus.
If (as you allege) you were a minor when you borrowed money at interest, and
that it has not been employed for your benefit, you can formally assert the
right of complete restitution against the note by means of which you incurred
the obligation.
Given on the third of the Nonesof February, during the second Consulate of
Gordian, 242.
TITLE XXXIX. WHERE A MINOR REJECTS AN ESTATE.
1. The Emperors Sevens and Antoninus to Florentius and Others.
If you have not interfered in the affairs of the estate of your father, it will
not be necessary for you to produce witnesses to prove that you have not
accepted it, as, in this instance, the truth of the matter does not require the
support of verbal testimony. If, however, you have acted as heir, or if you
have taken possession of the property, you should receive the benefit of
complete restitution, on account of your age, for which reason relief is
ordinarily granted.
Given on the sixth of the Nonesof May, during the Consulate of Saturninus and
Gallus, 199.
Extract from Novel 119, Chapter VI. Latin Text.
If all the creditors are present when restitution is demanded, they shall be
summoned by the judge to appear when the minor rejects
the estate, or if all or only some of them are absent, they shall be formally
summoned by the judge. If they should not appear within three months, the minor
can reject the estate without any risk, and the judge shall determine where and
how the property belonging to it shall be cared for, and an inventory shall be
made of the same.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Herodota.
If your grandparents made you their testamentary heir, and you have not entered
upon their estates, after having rejected your paternal succession, you have
the right to obtain the aid of complete restitution of the estates of your
grandparents (as you say that you are still of the proper age to do so), in
spite of the fact that you did not previously accept them.
Given on the third of the Nonesof February, during the Consulate of Gordian,
Consul for the second time, and Pompeianus, 242.
TITLE XL.
WHERE A MINOR DEMANDS RESTITUTION FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBTAINING AN ESTATE WHICH
HE HAS REJECTED, OR THE POSSESSION OF PROPERTY OR ANYTHING
ELSE.
1. The Emperor Gordian to Prota.
It has already been decided that minors of twenty-five years of age can demand
the benefit of complete restitution, not only with reference to their own
property which they have lost, but also where they did not accept an estate
which was left to them.
Given on the Idesof October, during the Consulate of Pius and Pontianus, 239.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Sarapiadus.
It has already been decided that minors should be admitted to demand the
benefit of complete restitution where praetorian possession of the estates of
their parents has been refused by them; but those who have been restored by a
decree must deliver to their brothers the property which they had at the time
of their father's death.
Given on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 294.
TITLE XLI.
IN WHAT INSTANCES COMPLETE RESTITUTION IS NOT
NECESSARY.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Mutatus.
It is stated in innumerable Rescripts of My ancestors, as well as in My own,
that, where minors of twenty-five years of age have not
avenged the death of their father, this cannot be pleaded against them,
especially where they are not defended by guardians and curators.
Given on the Idesof May, during the Consulate of Alexander, Consul for the
third time, and Dio, 230.
2. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus to Theodore.
We have previously plainly shown that the period of youth is not included in
the term of five years, on account of the expiration of which prescription is
ordinarily pleaded by children, who institute proceedings with reference to an
inofficious will too late. Therefore, complete restitution is not necessary
after a person has reached his majority, because the revival of an action which
has been extinguished is not granted to him, but the case itself remains
unimpaired.
Given on the second of the Idesof August, during the Consulate of Tuscus and
Bassus, 260.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Decimus.
It is an accepted rule of law that, in the case of minors, a person is
considered to be in default from the very moment when he delays payment of the
price of property, and this rule applies to all transactions which admit of
default, that is to say, to bona fidecontracts, trusts, and legacies.
4. The Same, and the Caesars, to Stratonica.
If your guardian, who has not given security for his administration, should be
sued, a decision rendered against him cannot injure your right, nor will any
business which he has transacted be valid; and therefore you will in vain
petition for complete restitution, since whatever he has done is absolutely
void in law, because, under the circumstances, he can not maintain the
character of a legal guardian.
Given at Nicomedia, on the eighteenth of the Kalendsof November, during the
Consulate of the Caesars, 294.
5. The Emperor Justinian to John, Praetorian Prefect.
In order to show indulgence to the non-age of minors, We decree that an
exception on the ground that money was not paid shall not run against them from
the beginning, lest, while We are expecting complete restitution, some obstacle
may arise on account of which a minor cannot avail himself of a privilege of
this kind, or his property may be threatened with loss; but it is more humane
to extend the interpretation of this law to all those cases in which the
ancient laws are applicable, and which permit temporary prescriptions to run
against minors, and come to their relief by means of complete restitution, so
that they may not run against them by operation of law; for it is better for
their rights to remain intact than for them to seek a remedy after these have
been endangered; but of course prescrip-
tions of thirty or forty years standing will remain in their present condition.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof November, after the Consulate of
Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
TITLE XLII.
WHO CANNOT OBTAIN COMPLETE RESTITUTION, AND AGAINST WHOM IT CANNOT BE OBTAINED.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Cononidus.
Where complete restitution is demanded, it is necessary for the judge having
jurisdiction to ascertain whether he who alleges that he is a minor and has
been injured has shown himself to be the diligent head of a household, and
acted so wisely in his public conduct that it is not probable that advantage
would have been taken of his age. If, however, after proper investigation, he
is shown to have been deceived, he should not, on this account alone, and by
the mere fact of the prescription, be excluded from the relief usually granted;
for instance, where he has been created a decurion while still a minor, on
account of the urgent necessities of his country; or where he has married and
had children for the purpose of educating them.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of Lupus and
Maximus, 253.
2. The Emperor Justinian to John, Praetorian Prefect.
It was doubted by the ancient authorities whether children could sue their
parents, or freedmen their patrons, as, by doing so, they would not conduct
themselves properly towards them, and some jurists held that complete
restitution could not be obtained against persons of this kind, as the force of
natural affection, or the respect due to a patron is opposed to such insolence,
unless there was some extraordinary cause for it, or the action was brought
against a person who was infamous.
Others held that any distinction of persons or causes should be rejected under
such circumstances, but they thought that restitution should only be granted
where the minor stated that he had been deceived on account of his
inexperience, and not been overreached by the fraudulent act of his father or
his patron; but, in order that the honor due to all parents as well as to
patrons and patronesses may remain unimpaired, We order that restitution shall
by no means be granted against parents of either sex, or against a patron or a
patroness; for the respect due to such persons excludes all restitution, as
there is no doubt that care should be taken that nothing injurious to their
reputations may take place.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof September, after the Consulate of
Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
TITLE XLIII. WHERE A MINOR ALLEGES THAT HE IS OF AGE.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Maximiana.
If you are under twenty-five years of age, and can prove that you have been
deceived by the records of your birth, from which it appears that you were over
that age, you can, after having attained your majority and within the time
prescribed by law, demand complete restitution of everything which has been
done contrary to your rights while you were a minor, of the magistrate having
jurisdiction of the case.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Maximus
and Paternus, 234.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Vitalianus.
If a person who alleges that he is at present a minor should deceive you by
falsely stating that he has attained his majority, he should not obtain
complete restitution, as the laws only afford relief to those who are mistaken
with reference to what has been legally established, and not to minors who are
guilty of fraud.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of
Diocletian and Maximian, 293.
3. The Same, and the Caesars, to Theodora.
If, while a minor, you attempted to prove that you had attained your majority
for the purpose of deceiving another, as malice supplies the defect of age, it
has been decided not only by the Imperial Constitutions, but also by the
authority of the Rescripts, that the benefit of restitution should be denied
you. When, however, this has been accomplished by the injustice or fraud of
your adversary, the privilege of restitution, which is usually granted to
minors after proper investigation, will continue to exist. Therefore, when
applied to, the Governor of the province, having examined the evidence of age,
shall provide for your complete restitution, if he finds that you have not been
guilty of fraud, and you prove that you were a minor at the time. But if you
have stated in some document, under oath, that you were of age, you must be
aware that you will be excluded from the benefit of complete restitution,
unless you can openly and clearly show that you were a minor by the production
of documents, and not by the statements of witnesses; but if you have actually
taken an oath of this kind, it is evident that, according to law, you will not
be entitled to any relief.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 294.
4. The Same, and the Caesars, to Labius.
As you allege that a mistake in proving the number of years was made before the
Governor, and as it is admitted that relief can be
granted to minors under paternal control, in cases of this kind, the Governor
of the province must examine the matters set forth in your petition, and if he
finds, by the evidence which you offer, that in computing your age, your
opinion was incorrect, when you thought that you had reached your majority, he
shall decide in your case whatever is in accordance with truth.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof December, during the Consulate of the Caesars,
294.
TITLE XLIV.
WHEN COMPLETE RESTITUTION IS DEMANDED MORE THAN ONCE.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Romanus and Others.
If you should desire complete restitution after a decision of the Proconsul has
been rendered against you, and you do not obtain it, you will, in vain, ask
that the proceedings having reference to complete restitution be revived, for
you ought to have appealed if the decision displeased you, but if you are still
of an age to be entitled to relief, We restore to you the right of appeal.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Chilo and
Libo, 205.
2. The Emperor Alexander to the Soldier Justus.
Although the curators of a female minor may have been defeated when they made a
demand in her behalf for complete restitution, still, as you allege that new
means of defence are now available in the case, the curators of your wife
should appear before the judge, and request to be permitted to present again
the reasons for complete restitution.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Alexander,
Consul for the second time, and Marcellus, 227.
3. The Emperor Philip to Anitia.
It has frequently been stated in Rescripts that the benefit of complete
restitution cannot legally be demanded more than once in one and the same case
(unless new defences are offered).
Given on the second of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of Peregrinus
and Æmilianus, 247.
TITLE XLV.
CONCERNING THOSE WHO OBTAIN A RELEASE FROM THE DISABILITY OP NON-AGE.
1. The Emperor Aurelian to Agathocles.
It is perfectly clear that those who, through the indulgence of the Emperor,
have obtained a release from the incapacity of age, even if they do not seem to
have administered their property in a proper
manner, cannot obtain the benefit of complete restitution, lest those who
contract with them may appear to have been deceived by the Imperial authority.
Given on the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Aurelian and Capitolinus,
275.
2. The Emperor Constantine to Verinus, Praetorian Prefect.
All young persons who are of good morals and desire to administer the estates
of their fathers or grandfathers, which have been left to them, and who on this
account, have need of the aid of the Emperor, are only entitled to a release
from the incapacity of age when they have completed their twentieth year, but
they cannot obtain this favor for themselves from the Emperor, unless they
establish their age by written instruments, and prove the integrity and
rectitude of their lives by the evidence of witnesses called to show what their
morals are.
(1) We order that women, also, whom the correctness of their morals and the
activity of their minds recommend, can obtain a release from the incapacity of
age after they have passed their eighteenth year; but, on account of the
modesty and reserve of the female sex, We do not compel them to be present in
public assemblies; still, having obtained this release from legal incapacity,
We permit them to prove their age by five witnesses, or by documents presented
by an attorney, in order that they may have the same rights in the transaction
of all business, as We have directed that men shall have; but they cannot
alienate their lands without a decree.
(2) The illustrious senators, however, who reside in this Imperial City, must
produce testimony with reference to their morals and honesty before your
tribunal; other persons shall appear before the Praetor, and all those in the
provinces are required to present their evidence to the Governors.
(3) Those who, through the indulgence of the Emperor, have obtained a release
from incapacity of age, without having conformed to the above-mentioned
formalities, are notified that such a release is of no force or effect.
Given at Rome, on the third of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of
Crispus and the Caesar Constantine, both Consuls for the second time, 321.
3. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Praetorian Prefect.
We order that those who already have obtained, or may hereafter obtain a
release from the incapacity of age through the indulgence of the Emperor, shall
not make any alienation or hypothecation of their real property without a
decree, in all cases where the alienation or hypothecation of such property by
those who have not obtained a release from the disability of age is necessary;
as the condition of all minors under such circumstances is similar, whether
they have obtained such indulgence or not.
Given on the eighth of the Idesof April, under the Consulate of Decius, 529.
4. The Same to the Senate.
When anyone desires something to be given or done, and mentions lawful age, or
states absolutely that he has attained his majority, We decree that such age be
understood to be that of twenty-five years, and not what is granted by the
favor of the Emperor. We desire this rule to be applicable in cases of
substitution or restitution, as well as to all other matters, unless it should
expressly be stated that reference to a release from the disability of age is
intended.
Given on the ninth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Lampadius
and Orestes, 530.
TITLE XLVI.
WHERE A MINOR RATIFIES HIS ACT AFTER HAVING ATTAINED HIS MAJORITY.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Eutychidnus.
Where partition has taken place, without any fraud, between minors under
twenty-five years of age, either in writing or without it, and the parties,
after arriving at lawful age, confirm the transaction, it is held to be valid.1
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof May, under the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors, 293.
2. The Same Emperors and Caesars to Sortirus.
Those who, after they have reached their twenty-fifth year, ratify transactions
made during their minority, will, in vain, demand that they be rescinded.
Given on the Idesof February, during the Consulate of the Caesars, 294.
TITLE XLVII.
WHERE, AND BEFORE WHAT JUDGE APPLICATION FOR COMPLETE RESTITUTION SHOULD BE
MADE.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Severus.
The decision of the Governor cannot be rescinded where a case involving
complete restitution has been decided by My deputy, for the Emperor, alone, can
grant complete restitution against the decision of his representative.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of Laetus and
Cerealis, 216.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Acquilina.
As you state that you have delivered the property which you were compelled to
give by the terms of a compromise, the result will be
1 The American rule with reference to the avoidance or ratification of
contracts by minors, after attaining their majority, is based upon this
principle.  ED.
that if you desire to institute proceedings to recover said property, either by
means of complete restitution, or in any other way, you must appear before the
Governor of the province in which the parties against whom you bring the action
have their domicile.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof September, after the third Consulate of
Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
3. The Emperor Justinian to John, Praetorian Prefect.
As we know that doubts have arisen, with reference to cases where complete
restitution is demanded, as to whether they should be heard by a magistrate of
general jurisdiction, or by judges specially appointed, when minors under the
age of twenty-five years or persons who have attained their majority make the
demand in accordance with the rules laid down by the ancient laws, or by Our
own Constitutions, We order that suits of this kind should not only be brought
before judges who have general jurisdiction, but also before those whom Our
August Majesty has appointed, or the administrators of Our government, both in
this Imperial City, and in the provinces, so that he who appointed the judge
may be considered as having jurisdiction of the matter, and grant complete
restitution, as well as examine the reasons for it, and, in this way, the
proceedings will not give rise to any difficulty.
In order, however, that no one may venture to give too broad a construction to
Our Constitution, and think that it extends to judges appointed for the purpose
of compromise, or to arbiters selected by common consent, or to persons
designated by judges who themselves have no jurisdiction but merely the power
to decide, We desire that, generally speaking, only those judges shall dispose
of such cases who have been appointed for a certain administration to which
jurisdiction has been added, or where others have been appointed by them; and
this rule is especially applicable when they have been delegated by Our Majesty
to determine such controversies. But, that no doubt whatever may remain, We
think that it should be provided that those judges whom we have enumerated
above shall be permitted to decide with reference to complete restitution,
where this right was specially conferred upon them (a course of procedure not
unknown to the ancients); or where they have been appointed without
limitations; or where, in other matters, some question relating to restitution
arises.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof September, after the Consulate of Lampadius
and Orestes, 531.
TITLE XLVIII.
CONCERNING REFLECTIONS MADE IN A JUDGMENT FOR COMPLETE RESTITUTION.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Tatian.
If the party who obtains complete restitution should not suffer any loss from
the proceeding, so also he should obtain no profit, and
hence he must deliver up anything which may come into his hands either from a
purchase, a sale, or any other contract. If, however, a minor under the age of
twenty-five years should be delegated, the right of action should be restored
in favor of the creditor against the original debtor. Where a minor enters upon
an estate, and obtains restitution, he must immediately surrender whatever he
obtained from the estate, and if he has been guilty of fraud, he should be held
responsible.
TITLE XLIX.
PROCEEDINGS TO OBTAIN COMPLETE RESTITUTION CAN ALSO BE INSTITUTED BY AN
ATTORNEY.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Licinius.
It is established that, if the right exists, an action for complete restitution
can also be brought by an attorney.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of
Pompeianus and Pelignus, 232.
TITLE L.
No NEW PROCEEDING TAKES PLACE WHEN A DEMAND FOR COMPLETE RESTITUTION IS MADE.
1. The Emperor Gordian to the Soldier Secundinus.
It is a plain rule of law that where complete restitution is demanded,
everything remains in the same condition until the case is terminated, and he
who has charge of such matters must see that this is done.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Gordian and
Aviola, 240.
TITLE LI.
CONCERNING THE RESTITUTION OF SOLDIERS AND OF PERSONS WHO ARE ABSENT ON
BUSINESS FOR THE STATE.
1. The Emperor Severus and Antoninus to Chilo.
If Valerian, Centurion of the Twelfth Cohort of the Alps, died before obtaining
possession of the property in question, his heir, as the representative of the
deceased, can legally demand the benefit of complete restitution within the
available year (if Valerian died while in the army), after the time has elapsed
during which the possession of the estate was left to him.
Given on the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of Lateranus and Rufinus,
198.
2. The Emperor Alexander to the Centurion Petronius.If persons who are absent
on public business have suffered any loss or if anyone should be released from
an action which could have
been brought against him by the said absent parties, complete restitution can
be granted them, within the available year, without their being barred by
prescription.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of
Alexander, Consul for the second time, and Marcellus, 227.
3. The Same to the Soldier Flavius Aristodemus.
A soldier, during a year after he has ceased to be absent on business for the
State, is permitted to claim any of his property which has been taken
possession of by someone during his absence, without the intermediate time
being included in the prescription; but after the said term has elapsed, he
cannot interfere with the rights of the possessor.
Given on the Nonesof January, during the Consulate of Maximus, Consul for the
second time, and Ælianus, 224.
4. The Emperor Gordian to Mastrianus.
You should not be ignorant of the fact that the property of persons who are
absent in the service of the State, without fraudulent intent, can only be
taken possession of where they are not defended in accordance with the judgment
of a good citizen, and that the sale should be postponed until they have ceased
to be absent on public business.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of Gordian
and Aviola, 240.
5. The Same to the Soldier Secundinus.
It is clear that the prescription of five years after a sale has been made by
the Treasury cannot prejudice the rights of persons who are absent on business
for the State, nor of others who have attained their majority and are entitled
to complete restitution.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof May, during the Consulate of Sabinus and
Venustus, 241.
6. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus to the Centurion Germanus.
If, while you were engaged in the performance of your military duties, the
heirs of your creditor sold the property which had been encumbered to their
ancestors, you can, after having appeared before the Governor of the province,
obtain complete restitution; and, the sale having been rescinded, you can
recover your property if you offer to pay the amount of the indebtedness or the
purchase-money, if it was less than the claim.
Given on the fourth of the Nonesof April, during the Consulate of Valerian and
Gallienus, 225.
7. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximum, and the Caesars, to Marina.
It is not proper for sons, under the pretext of military service, to demand
that affairs transacted by their father should be rescinded
as void, especially as you do not allege that your father, during his lifetime,
made any complaint with reference to the contract in question.
Given on the Nonesof February, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 294.
8. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Praetorian Prefect.
We order that those alone who are engaged in military expeditions shall be
entitled to take advantage of the time which elapsed during such expeditions,
not only in not being subject to the operation of exceptions, but also in order
to demand complete restitution. Those who are absent elsewhere, or are at home,
can, by no means, enjoy the benefit of claiming the above-mentioned privileges
during the time occupied by said expeditions.
Given at Constantinople, on the sixth of the Idesof April, during the Consulate
of Decius, 529.
TITLE LII.
CONCERNING THE WIVES OP SOLDIERS AND OP THOSE WHO ARE ABSENT ON BUSINESS FOR
THE STATE.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Secundina.
It is well known that it is customary, as in the case of soldiers, to grant
relief to women who are absent with their husbands on business for the State,
so far as temporary actions, which are extinguished by reason of absence, are
concerned.
Given on the third of the Nonesof December, during the Consulate of Alexander,
Consul for the second time, and Marcellus, 227.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Quintilian.
Prescription based upon a long lapse of time does not run against a woman who
has been for a considerable period with her husband, who was serving in the
army, but, for the reason that schemes fraudulently and shrewdly devised, on
account of prolonged absence of this kind, may not prejudice anyone, if such a
woman can show that a house which belonged to her was sold during her absence,
We order that the price which was actually paid for the same be refunded, and
that the woman receive the house.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the same
Emperors, 293.
TITLE LIII.
CONCERNING THE TIME DURING WHICH MINORS AND OTHER PERSONS, AS WELL AS THEIR
HEIRS, WHO HAVE A RIGHT TO COMPLETE RESTITUTION, CAN OBTAIN IT.
1. The Emperor Gordian to the Soldier Pudens.As you are a minor under the age
of twenty-five years, you can demand the benefit of complete restitution with
reference to those
matters in which you have sustained injury, for the entire time occupied by the
military expedition; for the period during which restitution can be demanded
after a minor has become of age, in this case should, in accordance with law,
be computed from the day of his discharge.
Given on the third of the Nonesof October, during the Consulate of Pius and
Pontianus, 239.
2. The Same to the Soldier Secundinus.
If your father died before he was of legal age, or even afterwards but before
the time prescribed by law had elapsed, and you became his heir, and before
having reached the age of twenty-five years, or even afterwards, but before the
time had expired during which your deceased father could have demanded
restitution, you enlisted in the army, the Governor of the province, after
proper investigation, shall come to your relief by granting you complete
restitution as the representative of the deceased.
Given on the eleventh of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of Pius
and Pontianus, 239.
3. The Same to the Soldier Mutianus.
If, during the years in which complete restitution could have been granted, you
were appointed to a command in the army, or enlisted and served your term as a
soldier, the benefit of restitution will continue by usucaption, even though it
may have been perfected before you entered the service, for it is not permitted
that you should be oppressed by the loss of your property.
Given on the ninth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of Pius and
Pontianus, 239.
4. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Dionysius.
If you demand the estates of your brothers, you can proceed against the person
of whom you complain, being aware that if your brothers, who were minors under
the age of twenty-five years, died while in the army, time would not run
against them to prevent them from obtaining complete restitution, but they
would transmit all their rights to their successor.
Given at Philippopolis, on the eighth of the Kalendsof January, during the
Consulate of the Caesars, 294.
5. The Emperor Constantine to Bassus, Praetorian Prefect.
Whatever has been provided by the laws with reference to the time during which
complete restitution can be demanded must be complied with. If anyone should
obtain from Us the benefit of release from the incapacity of age, it is proper
that the time should run from the day when Our Indulgence notified a competent
judge of the fact, and the administration of his own property was granted to
the party in question, so that he can proceed to obtain complete restitution,
and have his case terminated within the time prescribed by law.
The aid of complete restitution should, however, never be refused to minors
under the age of twenty-five years, so far as any business which they
transacted before they were released from the disability of age is concerned.
(1) When one minor succeeds to the rights of another, he is not prevented from
demanding complete restitution during the time prescribed by law, after he has
reached his twenty-fifth year.
(2) When a minor succeeds to the rights of one who has attained his majority,
he is only entitled to as much time for the purpose of demanding complete
restitution as the deceased whose heir, or the possessor of whose estate he is
proved to be, could have claimed.
(3) When a person, who is of age, obtains the estate of a minor, whether he
succeeds to it ab intestato,or under a will, the time when he can demand
restitution is reckoned from the day when he entered upon the estate. If,
however, he should acquire possession of the property under the praetorian law,
the time for examining and deciding with reference to complete restitution will
run from the date when he obtained possession of the property, without any
deduction whatever.
Given at Rome, on the Nonesof October, during the Consulate of Constantine and
Licinius-Caesar, both Consuls for the second time, 312.
Extract from Novel 100, Chapter II. Latin Text.
Where a minor, under the age of twenty-five years, does not make complaint as
soon as the dowry provided for is not paid, he can, nevertheless, be restored,
provided the twelfth year from the time of the marriage has not elapsed. If,
however, he should die within the prescribed time, a year shall be granted to
his heir. But if the heir of the deceased, whether he was of age or a minor, is
himself a minor, he shall enjoy the privilege of a term of five years, without
any reference to how old he may be.
6. The Same to Julian, Urban Prefect.
Where application for complete restitution has been made within the prescribed
time, and further delay is asked by the plaintiff which comes within the term
required for restitution, it shall be granted, whenever demanded, after proper
cause has been shown. If, however, the delay requested exceeds the specified
time, it must be refused the plaintiff, just as if it had been demanded within
the legal time and had gone beyond its limits, for he had the right to
institute proceedings when the delay requested would not have exceeded the
remaining time.
(1) When the defence of the action requires delay, We order that, after proper
investigation, it shall be granted, without consideration of the time, because
the party himself was not responsible for not having the suit begun sooner.
Hence the delay should be granted, even though when this is done it may exceed
the term prescribed for bringing suit, by which delay, if obtained by the
defendant, the plain-
tiff himself will not be prevented from obtaining evidence in his own behalf.
Given at Rome, on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate
of Constantine-Caesar, Consul for the fifth time, and Maximus, 319.
7. The Emperor Justinian to John, Praetorian Prefect.
We, with the intention of abolishing the unnecessary distinction of the
available year, in proceedings for complete restitution, do hereby order that,
in ancient Rome, as well as in this Fair City, and in Italy, and all other
provinces, the term of four continuous years shall be employed; and that they
shall be computed from the day on which the available year began to run, and
that this rule shall be adopted everywhere; as it seems to Us perfectly absurd
that any distinction should be made with reference to different places.
We order that this delay shall not only be granted in the case of the
restitution of minors (when the available year began to run from the first day
of their twenty-sixth year), but also with reference to persons of full age, so
that the above-mentioned continuous time shall, instead of the available years,
be observed both for the purpose of instituting proceedings and ending
litigation.
(1) And as the fact that they are under age is excepted in the case of the
restitution of minors, so in the case of those who have attained their
majority, the time during which they were absent on business for the State, or
where they were engaged in any other lawful undertaking enumerated in the
ancient laws, is also excepted; and, in this respect, the restitution of minors
and persons who have attained their majority is not dissimilar.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof September, after the Consulate of
Lampadius and Orestes, Consuls for the fifth time, 531.
TITLE LIV.
FOR WHAT REASONS PERSONS WHO HAVE ATTAINED THEIR MAJORITY OBTAIN COMPLETE
RESTITUTION.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Æmilianus.
If you have had judgment rendered against you while absent and undefended, on
account of having performed the duties of My envoy in good faith, you very
justly desire the revival of the case, and permission to make use of all your
defences from the beginning; for it has been decided that those also, who
perform the duties of envoys, enjoy the same privileges to which those do who
are absent on business for the State are entitled.
Given on the fifth of the Nonesof March, during the Consulate of the two
Aspers, 213.
2. The Same to Dionysius.
If you prove before the Governor of the province that it is true that you were
unable to appear before the arbiter, for the reason that you
were detained in military custody by order of the Governor, you can begin the
action anew.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of Laetus
and Cerealis, 216.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the . Caesars, to Proculus,
Decurion.
In bona fidecontracts, the laws come to the relief of persons of lawful age
also, through the official act of the judge who has cognizance of the case.
Given on the Nonesof August, during the Consulate of Diocletian and
Aristobolus, 285.
4. The Same to Priscianus.
The government usually enjoys the privilege of minors, and therefore it can
demand the relief of restitution.
Given on the eleventh of the Idesof November, during the Consulate of
Diocletian and Aristobolus, 285.
5. The Same to Licinianus.
If, having been taken prisoner by the enemy along with your father and mother,
the latter should die while in captivity, and you, having returned to your
country, should demand their estates by virtue of the Cornelian Law, you will
not be prevented from recovering the property by an action like that which is
granted for complete restitution opposing the exception of the time prescribed
by law (which it is customary to do).
Given on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 294.
TITLE LV.
CONCERNING AN ALIENATION MADE FOR THE PURPOSE OF CHANGING AN ACTION.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Attalus.
As possession provides a real action for an adversary, and complete restitution
is permitted by the Perpetual Edict, even when alienation of property has been
made for the purpose of changing the action, understand that if the person who
is in the possession of the same should sell and deliver it to a purchaser, to
avoid being sued, you have the legal right to choose against which of the
parties you will proceed.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 294.
TITLE LVI. CONCERNING THE APPOINTMENT OF ARBITERS.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Nepotiana.
It has frequently been stated in rescripts that an appeal cannot be taken from
the decision of an arbiter appointed after a compromise which has been made in
perfect compliance with law, because an action to enforce judgment cannot be
granted under these circumstances; and for this reason the promise of a penalty
is reciprocally made in order that, through fear of it, the parties may not
refuse to abide by the decision.
Where, however, judgment is rendered after the expiration of the time mentioned
in the compromise, it will be void, and the party who refuses to comply with it
will not be liable to any penalty.
Given at Rome, on the ninth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of
Antoninus, Consul for the fourth time, 223.
2. The Emperors Carus, Carinus, and Numerian to Clement.
If your adversary, in violation of the terms of the compromise, refuses to
appear before the arbiter who has been chosen, he will be considered to have
incurred the penalty agreed upon.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of Carus and
Carinus, 283.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Petronia.
If you do not comply with the award of the arbiters appointed under a
compromise, when the avarice or favor of those who rendered it is apparent, you
can avail yourself of the exception of malicious fraud against your daughter
bringing an action on the stipulation; but you will not be prevented from
proceeding against her under the clause providing against malicious fraud,
which is usually added to stipulations connected with compromise.
Given on the third of the Idesof January, during the Consulate of the same
Emperors, 293.
4. The Emperor Justinian to Demosthenes, Praetorian Prefect.
In order that perjury may not be committed in the case of arbiters, their
selection should be confirmed by the solemnity of an oath, and that opportunity
may not indiscriminately be afforded perfidious men to evade the decisions of
judges, We order that questions of this kind shall be decided by the arbiter as
follows:
(1) Where the same judge has been selected by both plaintiff and defendant, who
have agreed that the case shall proceed under the sanction of an oath, and the
litigants themselves have consented to this either in writing or in the
presence of public officials, or have stated it before the arbiter selected who
reduced it to writing, and it shall also be added that the arbiter himself
administered the oath
for the purpose of disposing of the case in accordance with the truth, We order
that the award shall, under all circumstances, remain unaltered, and that
neither the defendant nor the plaintiff can disobey it, but that they shall be
absolutely compelled to respect and comply
with it.
(2) If, however, nothing of this kind was either done or written by the
arbiter, but the parties themselves produced a statement in their own
handwriting, setting forth that they had bound themselves by oath to abide by
the decision of the arbiter, in this instance, his award shall be maintained
inviolate, for the reason that the statement of the parties themselves has the
same force, whether it was made in the beginning, or drawn up in the above-
mentioned manner at the time when the arbiter was chosen, or whether this
written instrument was found after final judgment was rendered, either for the
reason that the said parties confirmed the authority of the arbiter with the
solemn formality of an oath, or because they swore to execute what had already
been decided.
(3) If it is evident by the instruments or the statements already mentioned
that the arbiter himself alone took the oath, on the demand of the litigants,
that he would decide the case in accordance with the truth, the award in the
present instance, as in the former one, shall, in every respect, be valid
according to law.
(4) In all these cases, it shall be lawful for either an action in factum,a
personal action for recovery under the law, or an equitable real action to be
brought, according as circumstances may demand.
(5) If, however, nothing of this kind should appear, either in writing or in
the statements made, and only one party alleges that he has been sworn, no
faith shall be given to the award of the arbiter alone or to the statements of
one of the parties; for even if it should be admitted that an oath had been
taken, but not in the presence of the court, and no written evidence of either
of the parties was produced to show this, the conduct of an uncertain contest,
which frequently takes place among ignorant men, does not in the least deprive
the judgment of its force; but, in a case of this kind, all the rules should be
observed which the ancient authorities laid down with reference to the
selection of arbiters.
Extract from Novel 82, Chapter XI. Latin Text.
The new law provides that an arbiter shall not be appointed in such a way as to
decide under the sanction of an oath, but that he must fix a penalty which, if
paid, will permit a party to avoid the execution of the judgment. Where,
however, anything is done contrary to this, and the judge who decides
improperly does so through fraud, he may expect punishment from God; but if he
errs through ignorance, the oath will not be binding, nor will the litigants be
liable to punishment a second time.
THE TEXT OF THE CODE FOLLOWS.
(6) He who has stated in writing at the end of the award of the arbiter that he
approved of it, or that he would comply with it (by
using certain Greek terms for this purpose, which by custom are considered
preferable), although he may not have added "I promise," should be compelled by
the action in factumto perform what he agreed to; for what difference is there
when "I promise" is added to these words, or when the expression is absolutely
omitted? For if We have corrected many defects in stipulations, as well as
disposed of the innumerable circumlocutions and ambiguities with which they
were overwhelmed, after having abolished the ordinary formulas and the subtle
and superfluous statements which they contained, by means of laws recently
enacted by Us, why should We not remove all the perplexities of the ancient law
from instruments of this description, so that, where such an instrument is
drawn up, one of the parties will be obliged to acquiesce in it, and be
absolutely compelled to carry it into effect? For it is not probable that a
document of this kind has been written only for the purpose of having it
disputed; but rather in order that a decision, against which no opposition can
be manifested, may be executed.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of Decius,
529.
5. The Same to Julian, Praetorian Prefect.
As has previously been decided in the choice of arbiters, where no penalty for
the violation of a compromise was prescribed, and they were not appointed by a
judge, and no common selection was made in compliance with the preceding
decision, but this was done by common consent of the parties, the result will
be that if the award was in favor of the defendant, an exception on the ground
of contract will lie in his favor, but if it was in favor of the plaintiff, he
will obtain no advantage from it; and We order with reference to those arbiters
whom We have mentioned above, and who have been selected by common consent,
under an agreement either written or verbal, that their award must be
maintained; and if, after it has been rendered, the parties stated in writing
that they were not displeased with it, not only an exception based on the
agreement can be pleaded in behalf of the defendant, but also, by Our law, an
action in factum,will lie in favor of the plaintiff, so that he can direct the
award to be executed in this Imperial City by the Most Eminent Prefecture, or
by the court having jurisdiction of the defendant, and in the provinces this
can be done not only by the Governors, but by their subordinates, as well as by
the judges having jurisdiction over the person who was sued.
If, however, after the decision was rendered, the parties interested did not
sign the decree of the arbiter, but confirmed it by their silence, and within
the next ten days no protest was sent to the judge or by either party to his
adversary, by which it became evident that the award was not accepted, then it
is confirmed by the silence of the parties, and an exception will lie in favor
of the defendant, and the above-mentioned action in favor of the plaintiff.
Where, however, one of the parties, after having complied with the formalities
above
mentioned, and not being willing to have the award executed rejects it, no
prejudice to the rights of the parties will result, nor will the defendant have
a right to an exception, nor the plaintiff to an action. Those arbiters,
however, who have been chosen under the solemnity of an oath, are excepted
under a new constitution which We have promulgated, for in this case all the
provisions on this subject set forth in Our law must be complied with.
(1) Although We are not ignorant of the opinion of Julius Paulus, and of
certain other persons learned in the law, who have touched upon this question
which we are at present discussing, they have not treated it in the most
skilful manner, but have held that the decision should stand, so far as certain
temporary actions are concerned. We, however, decide in a more complete and
general way that an agreement entered into in writing in the presence of the
arbiter appointed as the result of a compromise, interrupts the prescription,
just as if the proceedings had been instituted before an ordinary judge.
(2) With reference to this point, We order that, generally speaking, in
controversies brought before arbiters, where a question of fact is involved,
the statements of the litigants or the witnesses can also be made in the
presence of ordinary judges.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof ..., during the Consulate of Lampadius and
Orestes, 530.
6. The Same to John, Praetorian Prefect.
We order that women shall be mindful of their modesty, and confine themselves
to the performance of those functions for which Nature has designated them, and
avoid those from which she has ordered them to abstain; and although where
those of the highest reputation may have accepted the office of arbiter, or
where, being patronesses, they have acted in this capacity for their freedmen,
they shall be separated from all judicial duties, so that no penalty can be
imposed for their selection, and no exception on the ground of an agreement can
be pleaded against such persons as justly despise their decisions.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of
Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
TITLE LVII. CONCERNING THE FURNISHING OF SECURITY.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian and the Caesars.
It is a certain rule of law that anyone who becomes the attorney of the
plaintiff shall not be compelled to furnish security that his principal will
ratify his act; for, in this case, the attorney should be understood to appear,
as it were, in the presence of him who employed him. Therefore, if the
constituent, having afterwards changed his mind, should be unwilling for his
attorney to represent him, the judge must consider everything which the
attorney has done in the case as valid. Where, however, in the beginning of the
action, he is opposed
by an allegation of the defence, and he himself is, in this instance,
considered as the attorney of the absent party, he ought to be compelled to
give security to offer a defence against the exception; and if he does not do
so, the judge should not permit the case which was brought against him to
proceed further. The attorney, or the defender of the party sued, however, even
though he was appointed in the presence of witnesses, shall, in all cases, at
the commencement of the proceedings, be compelled to furnish security to pay
any judgment which may be rendered against him.
Given on the ninth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 294.

TITLE LVIII.
CONCERNING THE SUPPRESSION OF FORMULAS AND CLAIMS, OR RIGHTS OF ACTION.

1. The Emperor Constantine to Marcellinus, Governor of Phnicia.
The legal formulas which, by the subtlety of their phraseology, menaced all
pleadings, shall be absolutely suppressed.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of
Constantius, Consul for the third time, and Constans, Consul for the second
time, 342.

2. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Hierius, Urban Prefect.
No exception in a case of more or less importance shall be pleaded against
anyone on account of an action not having been granted, if it should be
established that the said action is applicable to the matter in question, and
has reference to the cause for which suit was brought.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Felix and
Taurus, 428.

TITLE LIX.
CONCERNING THE TENDER OF THE OATH WITH REFERENCE TO CALUMNY.
1. The Emperor Justinian to Demosthenes, Praetorian Prefect.
In all cases, whether you base your action upon private papers, public
documents, or upon anything else which requires the production of evidence, We
order that it shall not be produced unless the party who demands it first takes
the oath relating to calumny, and swears that he does not make these
allegations for the purpose of postponing judgment; for the contentious
activity of litigants is restrained by fear of the oath.
(1) In order that certain persons may not indulge the cruelty of their
dispositions by unnecessarily subjecting their slaves to torture,
those who ask that slaves should be put to the question shall not have their
request complied with, nor shall they be heard by the judges, unless, placing
their hands upon the Holy Scriptures, they swear that they do not make this
application on account of hatred of the slaves, or because they are offended
against their co-heirs, but for the reason that they cannot otherwise ascertain
or establish the truth of matters relating to the estate.
Given at Constantinople, on the twelfth of the Kalendsof October, during the
fifth Consulate of Decius, 529.
Extract from Novel 49, Chapter III. Latin Text.
This oath is not exacted at present, as in the beginning of the action the
party swears not to demand anything from malicious motives during the entire
proceedings.
2. The Same to John, Praetorian Prefect.
As We have already decided that judges shall not dispose of cases unless in the
presence of the Holy Gospels, and decreed that advocates throughout the entire
dominions of the Roman Empire must first be sworn before undertaking the
conduct of cases, We consider it necessary to promulgate the present law, by
which We order that in all litigation begun after it has been published,
neither the plaintiff nor the defendant can, in the beginning of an action,
state their claims, unless, after they have filed their petitions and answered,
and before the advocates on both sides have taken the oath prescribed by law,
the principals themselves have been sworn. The plaintiff shall swear that he
has not brought suit through enmity, but that he thinks that he has a good
reason for doing so, and the defendant shall not be permitted to prove his
allegations, unless he himself first makes oath that he has entered the contest
with confidence in the justness of his cause; and, after this, the learned
advocates on both sides (as has already been decreed by Us), shall be sworn
upon the Holy Gospels placed before the judge.
Extract from Novel 49, Chapter III. Latin Text.
There should be added to this oath, in order to prevent it from being
frequently taken during the proceedings, that no evidence will be required
during the entire case, except such as the parties may think necessary to be
produced in order to ascertain the truth.
Extract from Novel 124, Chapter I. Latin Text.
The principal parties, or those to whom in the meantime the case has been
transferred, shall swear in the presence of the judges that they have not
promised, or given anything whatever, either to the latter or to anyone else,
for the purpose of obtaining their favor; and that they will not afterwards
give anything either directly, or through the medium of others, excepting to
those who have been employed as their own advocates, and to the other persons
to whom Our laws permit payment to be made.
(1) When lawsuits, or requests for advice, are brought before Our Sacred
Consistory, the oath above mentioned shall be taken in the presence of the
Senate.
(2) If any of the litigants should be unable to appear in court, they, along
with the adverse party, shall take the aforesaid oath in the presence of
officers appointed for this purpose by the judge.
(3) A woman of noble rank, during the absence of her adversary, shall also be
sworn in the presence of the officers.
(4) If the parties happen to be elsewhere, or if one of them should be absent,
they shall be sworn before the judge of the province, or the defenders of the
district, and the fact shall be recorded.
(5) When one of the litigants refuses to take the aforesaid oath, if he is the
plaintiff, he shall lose his action by the decision of the magistrate; if he is
the defendant, he shall have judgment rendered against him.
(6) Guardians and curators must take the above-mentioned oath in actions which
they bring.
THE TEXT OF THE CODE FOLLOWS.
(1) If, however, the rank or sex of the party does not permit him or her to
appear in court, the oath shall be taken in the house of the litigant, of
course, in the presence of the other party, or his attorney.
(2) It must be noted that where guardians or curators, or any other persons who
transact the business of others, by lawful authority, are concerned, it is
proper that they, also, should be subjected to the requirement of the oath,
because they understand the case which they are conducting. For neither a ward,
a minor, nor any other persons of this kind can be familiar with it; and hence
none are obliged to appear in court except such as have charge of the
guardianship or curatorship, or some other legal administration. For this
reason they must swear according to the knowledge which they possess, and
although the true nature of the case may perhaps be different, still, what each
one believes and thinks must be sworn to, and all other oaths which have come
down to us from former laws, or which have been established by Ourselves, shall
remain in full force.
(3) Where, however, either of the parties is absent, and his case is conducted
by an attorney, if it is the plaintiff, he cannot be permitted to direct his
attorney to proceed before he himself takes the oath of calumny, with the
proper formalities, in the province in which he resides.
In like manner, if the defendant should be absent, and has appointed an
attorney, and agreed by a stipulation to pay any judgment which might be
rendered against him, or if a defender should voluntarily appear for him, he
himself shall be sworn as hereinbefore prescribed, in the presence of the
plaintiff, or in that of his duly appointed attorney, or even in his absence
(if the judge should permit it), which act must be made a matter of record.
(4) But for the reason that We fear that the parties, being in collusion, may
perhaps dispense with this oath to be taken by them, and by such dissimulation
evade Our law, We order all judges, even though they only have jurisdiction by
virtue of a compromise, to use every effort to prevent the oath from being
avoided, and under all circumstances to require it to be taken by both
plaintiff and defendant; as We have promulgated the present law for the common
welfare, and not for the convenience of individuals, in order that this
proceeding may not, little by little, fall into disuse, and the oath of the
principal parties or advocates in some way or other be curtailed.
(5) We have also decided that the following addition should be made to this
law; namely, if anyone should desire to bring an action for another, without
any mandate having been given, but after having furnished security that his
principal will ratify whatever he has done in the matter, the law shall not be
considered to have been evaded by means of this artifice; and We order that if
anything of this kind should take place hereafter (whether someone desires to
bring suit in behalf of an individual, or for a corporate body, a village, or
any other association), he must furnish the usual security; but he cannot
proceed further with the action unless, within the time fixed by the judge, the
latter causes the principal parties to be sworn, either in the presence of
their adversary, or (if the latter prefers it), in the presence of the
attorney; and, if the other party is not present, the oath of calumny shall be
taken and duly recorded in the presence of the defender of the district, either
by the party for whose benefit the action was brought, or by the majority, or
the most prominent of the members of the association.
(6) Where, however, the plaintiff is unwilling to take the oath of calumny, and
this fact is legally established, he shall not be permitted to proceed with the
case, but he shall lose it as a dishonest litigant, the displeasure of the
judges toward him shall be manifested by a severe reprimand, and he shall be
deprived of all hope of obtaining a judgment.
(7) If the defendant should refuse to take this oath, he shall be considered as
having confessed the truth of everything set forth in the petition of the
plaintiff, and the judge can render a decision according as the nature of the
case may suggest.
(8) In this manner, not only the number of lawsuits, but also that of
calumniators will be diminished, and men will think that they are rather in
sanctuaries than in courts of justice. For if the principal parties- among the
litigants conduct their actions after taking this oath, and their advocates
also take it, and the magistrates themselves hear the cases, and pronounce
judgment in the presence of the Holy Scriptures, what else can be believed than
that God himself is the judge of men in all their cases? Hence the ancient oath
of calumny, together with all its subterfuges, having been abolished, Our clear
and comprehensive Constitution shall shine throughout all countries, and be the
best remedy for the disposal of litigation.
(9) We desire that the above-mentioned oath shall be taken at the very origin
of a case, when litigation has not yet been begun. Where, however, causes are
already pending, or where issue has been joined and the ordinary judicial
security has been furnished, both parties shall be compelled to take the oath
in the same city or province in which they dwell, immediately after the
promulgation of this law. If one of them should be absent, the trial of the
case ought not to be deferred on this account, and any other course will be
contrary to what We have prescribed, and what has been introduced to shorten
litigation will at once be changed to the opposite; hence We order that the
party who is present must, without fail, take the oath, and that the absent
party shall be excused from doing so, provided, however, that the case is
pending (as has been previously stated). When both of the principal parties are
absent, to prevent litigation from being protracted for too long a time, cases
that are pending can proceed without the oath.
Given on the fourth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Justinian,
Consul for the fourth time, and Paulinus, 534.







THE CODE OF OUR LORD THE MOST HOLY
EMPEROR JUSTINIAN.
SECOND EDITION.


BOOK III.

TITLE I. CONCERNING JUDGMENTS.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Clement.
A stipulation for the payment of interest does not lose its effect after suit
has been brought, hence the result will be that you can sue your debtor for
interest incurred during the proceedings which was not included in the
judgment.
Given on the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Antoninus and Geta, both
Consuls for the second time, 209.
2. The Same to Valerius.
Although judgment may have been rendered in a suit which you brought against
your guardian, still, the right of action on guardianship is not extinguished,
and therefore if you again institute proceedings before the same judge, and an
exception on the ground of res judicatais interposed against you, you can
properly avail yourself of a reply based on malicious fraud if you allege that
the claim in the present action is not the same as the one which was disposed
of in the former one.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of Faustinus
and Rufinus, 211.
3. The Emperor Alexander to Faustina.
Whenever the question of a person's condition arises, where the title to
property is involved, there is nothing to prevent the magistrate, who, in every
other instance, cannot take cognizance of the question of condition, from
deciding the controversy.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof February, during the Consulate of Julian,
Consul for the second time, and Crispinus, 229.
4. The Same to Popilius.
If, after the price of land purchased by your curators has been paid, and the
instruments evidencing the sale have been delivered, you have not brought
forward the question of omission of guarantee in case of eviction, you
understand that when the case has once been decided it cannot be renewed.
Given on the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Modestus and Probus,
229.
5. The Emperor Gordian to Marcellus.
When one judge is delegated by another, he has no power to designate a third,
as he himself performs judicial functions, unless he was appointed by the
Emperor himself.
Given on the fourth of the Nonesof September, during the Consulate of Pius and
Pontianus, 239.
6. The Same to Junia.
A slave cannot interfere with a judgment, and if no decree of condemnation has
been issued against him, what has been decided shall stand.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of
Gordian and Aviola, 240.
7. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Hyrina.
When you allege that a slave of your debtor, who has been pledged to you, holds
certain property of his deceased master, you ask, contrary to law, that actions
be granted against him; for as no suit can be brought between a slave and a
freeman, it is more proper for you to apply to the court to give you possession
of the property pledged than to demand what is illegal.
Given on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 294.
8. The Emperors Constantine and Licinius to Dionysius.
It has been decided that, in all things, the principles of justice and equity,
rather than the strict rules of law, should be observed.
Given on the Idesof May, during the Consulate of Volusianus and Annianus, 314.
9. The Emperor Constantine to Maximus.
It is necessary for judges, in the first place, thoroughly to examine the
character of the matter in dispute, and then to interrogate both parties
frequently as to whether they desire to add anything, as this is a benefit to
both of them, whether the case is to be decided by the judge, or is to be
referred to someone higher in authority.
Given on the second of the Idesof January, during the Consulate of Licinius and
Crispus, 316.
Extract from Novel 116, Chapter II. Latin Text.
When one party has stated his case, but the other alleges that he still has
something to advance, We order that the judge shall compel the latter who asks
for postponement, without fail or further delay, to set forth explicitly what
he wishes, within thirty days after the other party has filed his complaint;
and if he does not do so, the judge shall grant him another month for the
purpose of conquering his obstinacy; and if he should still delay, another
shall be given him, so that if he does not make his allegations within the
three months aforesaid, the magistrate having jurisdiction of the suit shall
not wait any longer, but shall render his decision in conformity to all laws
and customs; or, if he should be unwilling to do so, he must make a report, so
that evil-disposed litigants may not be permitted to defer a decision for a
longer time.
10. The Same to Severus, Urban Prefect.
A hearing should absolutely be refused to a person who divides a case which
should be determined without it, and, as a privilege, desires to try before
several judges what can be decided by one and the same magistrate. It is the
duty of a judge to punish anyone who presents a petition contrary to this law,
and having made a demand for possession before one judge, attempts to have the
principal question in the case disposed of by another.
11. The Emperor Justinian to Julian, Praetorian Prefect.
In order to prevent litigation from becoming almost perpetual and exceeding the
term of human life (as Our law has already limited criminal cases to two years,
and pecuniary actions more frequently occur, and are known sometimes to give
rise to criminal proceedings), it seems to Us to be advisable to promulgate the
present law, for the purpose of regulating such matters throughout the entire
earth, so that it may not be subject to limitation by either space or time.
(1) Therefore, We decree that all suits which are brought for the recovery of
any sum of money whatsoever, or with reference to civil conditions, the rights
of cities or of private individuals; the possession, ownership, or
hypothecation of property, servitudes; or any other questions on account of
which litigation occurs between men; with the sole exception of such cases as
involve the rights of the Treasury, or the discharge of official duties, shall
not, after issue has been joined, be deferred longer than the term of three
years.
All judges, either in this Fair City or in the provinces, whether they are
invested with inferior or superior jurisdiction, or discharge the functions of
magistrates, or have been appointed by Us, or by Our nobles, shall not be
permitted to protract cases for a longer time than the term of three years, for
no one is not aware that this provision is superior to any judicial authority,
and if the parties themselves should not acquiesce, no one can be found who
will be bold enough to postpone a case against the consent of the judge.
(2) If, however, the plaintiff should cease to prosecute his case, and the
defendant should be wearied with the long delay, and the term of three years
after the joinder of issue should be approaching its end, so that only six
months remain, the judge, after the defendant has complained of the plaintiff's
absence and the matter has been duly considered, is authorized to seek him out
by means of his bailiffs, and when this has been done three times (the term of
ten days being allowed for each application), and the plaintiff is not found,
and does not appear either in his own proper person or by an attorney, We
decree that the judge shall then examine the papers which have been filed with
him, and if there should be no sufficient grounds upon which to act, and upon
which a positive decision can be rendered, We desire that not only the
defendant shall be released from all liability so far as the action is
concerned, but that the plaintiff shall be condemned to pay all the expenses
which are ordinarily incurred in lawsuits, and the amount of which shall be
established by the oath of the defendant; and any security which the latter may
have deposited with reference to the case, which, if it had remained would have
been released by operation of law, shall be returned to him.
If, however, from the evidence in the possession of the judge, it appears that
the plaintiff was not found, the judge can find a way by which it may become
clear to him what decision he should render; and if the plaintiff should seem
to have the better case, the judge shall not, even though he is absent,
hesitate to render a decision against the defendant who is present in favor of
the absent plaintiff, and only the costs which the defendant shall swear he has
lawfully incurred in the action shall be deducted from the judgment. Although
the plaintiff has the better case, We impose this penalty upon him solely on
account of his obstinacy in being absent, and he shall, by no means, have the
power to reopen the action, but his contumacy shall cause the loss of his case
altogether, if the defendant is discharged.
Where, however, a judgment is rendered against the defendant, in favor of the
absent plaintiff, for an amount which the latter may, perhaps, think is not
sufficient, We do not, under any circumstances, permit him to revive the case;
and this is the penalty which We inflict upon him.
(3) But if the defendant should be absent, and a similar search is conducted
for him, as We have mentioned in the case of the plaintiff, and if he also
should remain absent, and be in default; the judge, according to what is
prescribed by the ancient laws, shall thoroughly
inform himself as to the suit, by interrogating the party who is present, and
if he should be found to be liable, the judge shall not fail to render a
decision against the absent party, which must be executed and the claim of the
successful litigant be satisfied by the pecuniary resources of him who is
absent; and the judge himself can either do this on his own authority, or it
can be referred by a report to a superior magistrate, so that a lawful way may
be opened to reach the property of the contumacious party. Neither he, nor
anyone else, shall have permission to interfere when the plaintiff is placed in
possession in this way; for if the defendant himself should return, and desire
to give sureties, and recover possession, he shall not be heard, as in cases of
this kind We exclude all opposition.
(4) When either the plaintiff or the defendant is in default, the examination
of the case should proceed without any impediment, for as soon as the Holy
Scriptures are brought forward, the absence of the litigant is supplied by the
presence of God; and the judge should not apprehend any appeal from his
decision, since one who is known to be absent through obstinacy has no right to
appeal; which is the undoubted rule established by the ancient laws.
(5) A decision of this kind, however, must be rendered near the end of the said
term of three years, for which purpose We have introduced the present law. If,
however, either party already has been absent for some time, and a considerable
portion of the time remains, and he is expected to return, the decision shall
only release him from the payment of costs; and, in this instance, the
termination of the suit and the judgment rendered against the absent party only
take place where a short time remains for the expiration of the three years.
(6) If, however, the case should have been decided in the absence of one of the
parties, or in the presence of both, all the judges appointed in Our Empire are
notified that the party who is defeated shall be condemned to pay the costs of
the action to the one who gains it, but only so much as the latter may swear
that the ordinary expenses amount to; for they are aware that if they should
omit this, they themselves will be liable to this penalty, and will be
compelled to pay it to the injured party.
(7) It has seemed proper to Us to establish these rules with reference to
parties litigant, when they are absent through contumacy, for the purpose of
complying with the principles of equity.
(8) When either of the parties, desiring to proceed with the case, applies to
the judge, and the latter is unwilling to hear him, either because of his
friendship for the adverse party, or his hostility to himself, or on account of
dishonorable gain, or because of some other vice which may arise in the soul of
despicable magistrates of this kind, he himself should wish to prolong the
proceedings, and, in consequence, the term of three years should elapse, and
the judge should be appointed to the office of magistrate, or to a higher
position, or even raised to illustrious rank, he shall be compelled by the
Court of the Palace to pay ten pounds of gold into the Treasury of Our Private
Largesses.
If, however, he is a judge of inferior jurisdiction, he shall be punished with
a fine of three pounds of gold, to be collected by the same court and paid into
Our Treasury, and, having been removed from office, another judge should be
appointed in his stead, and shall, under the same circumstances, be liable to a
similar penalty.
All these things take place when one judge hears the case from the beginning;
but if, during the course of three years, judgment has been delayed, either by
the death of the judge, or by some other unavoidable accident, and one year or
more remains during which it can be decided, another judge shall be appointed
for that purpose. If, however, less than a year should remain, then all the
time lacking shall be added, in order that the newly appointed judge may not
only hear, but determine the case within the full period of a year.
(9) It should undoubtedly be observed that, if it is not the fault of the
litigant or the judge that the progress of the case has been retarded, but the
advocates are responsible for it, permission is given to the judge to fine them
two pounds of gold as a penalty, to be collected by the Court of the Palace,
and in the same manner applied to public purposes. The judge shall also state
in his decision whether the delay has been caused by the attorneys of either
the defendant or the plaintiff, and whether this has been done by all or only
by some of them; hence, those who undertook to conduct the case should continue
to do so until it has been terminated (unless the law, or some good reason
prevents them from doing so), so that delay may not result from their refusal
to proceed. Their fees should, by all means, be paid to the learned advocates
by their clients, if they can do so; and where they fail to pay them, they can
be collected by those who have charge of the affairs of the court, lest by an
artifice of this kind, cases may be delayed, unless the litigant should prefer
to select another advocate instead of the one whom he first employed.
(10) All these matters have been provided for by Us with reference to parties
of full age, whose judgment renders them capable of transacting every kind of
business.
(11) Where, however, the cases of wards or minors, or similar persons subject
to legal disability and acting under the supervision of others are concerned,
whether they are of the male or female sex, and suit has been brought by their
guardians, curators, agents, or attorneys, and through their neglect of duty
the three years have elapsed, and the right of action has been extinguished,
the proceedings, nevertheless, will retain all their force; but the injury
resulting from this neglect shall fall upon the guardians and curators, or
their sureties, and the heirs and their property, and upon all persons who have
any lawful interest in the matter. When, however, their property does not prove
sufficient to satisfy the claims of their wards or minors, it has been decided
that then they shall be entitled to the benefit of complete restitution for all
the loss which they may have sustained.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Lampadius
and Orestes, Consuls for the fifth time, 539.
12. The Same to Julian, Praetorian Prefect.
We are not introducing anything that is new or unusual, but only what has
already been established by the ancient legislators, for ever since these rules
have been treated with contempt, no small injury to litigation has resulted.
For who is ignorant of the fact that judges in former times could not accept
the judicial office unless they had previously made oath that they would on all
occasions decide according to the truth, and in compliance with the law?
Therefore, as We have found that this course has not usually been pursued, and
that the laws having reference to oaths which We previously published have
convinced litigants of the great benefit which they produced, and hence were
deservedly praised by all, We now come to this decree, which shall be valid for
all time, and by which We direct that all judges, whether of superior or
inferior jurisdiction, who have been appointed to office, either in this
Imperial City or elsewhere throughout the world subject to Our empire, as well
as those to whom We have accorded the right to hear cases, or who may be
appointed by superior judges, or who have authority to decide in their own
jurisdiction, or have been selected under an agreement, that is to say, in
accordance with a compromise (which resembles a judgment), who undertake to
dispose of lawsuits, whether they act as arbiters by virtue of a decree, or
have been chosen by the consent of the parties, and, generally speaking, all
judges learned in the Roman Law, shall not undertake to hear a case, unless the
Holy Scriptures have previously been placed in front of the judicial tribunal,
and remain there, not only during the beginning, but also throughout the entire
examination, until the very end, and the promulgation of the final decision.
If, therefore, paying attention to the Holy Scriptures, and being consecrated
by the presence of God, they dispose of litigation with the aid of a higher
power, let them know that they must not judge others in any other way than they
themselves are being judged, as this will be more terrible to them than to the
parties themselves; for while the litigants are judged by men, they themselves
introduce cases to be weighed and determined with the assistance of God.
This judicial oath shall be made known to all, and shall be added by Us to the
Roman Law, and be observed by all magistrates, and if it is neglected, those
who treat it with contempt will do so at their peril.
Extract from Novel 15, Last Section but One. Latin Text.
At present they swear that they will do what seems to them to be more just and
better, with the exception of municipal defenders, who swear that they will do
everything in conformity with the laws and justice.
THE TEXT OF THE CODE FOLLOWS.
After issue has been joined, the case of the plaintiff presented, and the
answer filed, in any action of greater or less importance,
whether brought before arbiters who have been appointed under the terms of a
compromise, or in some other way, or elected, the advocates employed on both
sides shall be sworn with their hands upon the Holy Gospels that they will
endeavor to do everything for their clients which they think to be honorable
and just, by every exertion of their knowledge and power, and that they will,
as far as possible, neglect nothing available for this purpose.
Where, however, they believe the case to be disgraceful or absolutely
desperate, or based upon false allegations, knowing this to be the fact, they
will be guilty of bad faith in taking charge of such a suit. If, however,
during the proceedings, they obtain any information to this effect, they must
withdraw from the case, and absolutely cease to have any connection with a
matter of this kind. This having been done, the abandoned litigant shall not be
permitted to seek the aid of another advocate, lest those of a better class
having repudiated him, he may have recourse to one who is unprincipled.
Where a party to a suit has employed several advocates, and all of them have
been sworn, and some, during the progress of the case, think that it should be
tried, and others refuse to proceed, the latter should retire, and those who
agree to do so should remain; for a case can be conducted to its termination
where some advocates, through timidity, withdraw, and others who are more bold,
persist in trying it; nor, under such circumstances, should permission be
granted to the litigants to substitute others instead of those who are
unwilling to continue.
Given on the fourth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Lampadius
and Orestes, 530.
13. The Same to Julian, Praetorian Prefect.
When a party who was absent at the time when he was called afterwards appears,
We order all judges, both in this Most Illustrious City and in the provinces,
not to inform him of the condition of the case, but, on the other hand, exclude
him from all knowledge of it, unless he previously makes reparation for any
loss sustained by his adversaries through his fault, as well as pays all the
expenses of conducting the case, and the fees of the advocates, or any other
costs which may have been incurred in the action. The amount of these shall be
determined by the judge after the party who incurred the expense has been
sworn, in proportion to the services rendered by the court officials; and all
Our judges and their subordinates are hereby notified that, if they neglect
anything of this kind, they will be compelled to reimburse, out of their own
property, those who have suffered any loss.
We decree that this rule shall be observed by ordinary judges when litigants,
who are required to be present (even though they have not been summoned),
absent themselves with fraudulent design.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Lampadius and
Orestes, Consuls for the fifth time, 530.
Extract from Novel 82, Chapter X. Latin Text.
After an estimate of the costs has been made and sworn to, the judge shall not
be allowed to increase it; but, at present, when he has made the estimate and
fixed the amount, he is not empowered to allow a smaller sum than has been
sworn to. If, however, he should perceive that on account of the nature of the
case, neither of the litigants ought to be subjected to any expense, he must
state this in his decision.
14. The Same to Julian, Praetorian Prefect.
It is a clear rule of law that litigants can reject judges appointed to hear a
case before it is begun, and, in accordance with the general regulations of
your tribunal, it has been established that where a judge is rejected, the
parties will be compelled to choose arbiters, and submit their claims to them.
Even when the judge was appointed by the Emperor, for the reason that We have
set our hearts upon all suits being conducted without any suspicion of
unfairness, the party who thinks that a judge is liable to suspicion can reject
him, and have recourse to another, before proceedings are instituted; as, after
issue has once been joined, We have already decided that no appeal can be taken
before final judgment, nor any judge be rejected in order to prevent
proceedings from being indefinitely prolonged; and therefore the same official
should, under the authority vested in ordinary judges and with all the
assistance of the laws, compel the parties to choose arbitrators, and appear
before them, and submit their cases just as if the arbitrators had been
appointed by the Emperor himself
We decree that this rule shall also be observed where the judge has not been
appointed by the Emperor, but by some other official.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifth of the Kalendsof May, during the
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, Consuls for the fifth time, 530.
Extract from Novel 86, Chapter II. Latin Text.
If, however, one of Our subjects should happen to suspect the judge, We order
that the holy archbishop, or bishop of the diocese, shall hear the case, along
with the illustrious judge, so that they both may, by amicable agreement,
remove any suspicion, either by committing the facts to writing, or by deciding
the controversy between the litigants as magistrates, and prevent the suits of
persons residing in the provinces from being protracted for a long time, while
they are absent from home. If the judge should refuse to obey the archbishop,
the latter must write to the Emperor, who will take measures to punish him.
15. The Same to John, Praetorian Prefect.
It is a positive rule of law that authority to dispose of litigation is
conceded to military men, for what is there to prevent men who are' skilled in
other matters from rendering decisions in this? We
know that the competency of military magistrates and all such persons has
already been approved, on account of their daily experience, so that they hear
and decide cases, and terminate disputes of this kind, according to the
dictates of their consciences and their knowledge of the law.
Given on the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes,
Consuls for the fifth time, 530.
16. The Same to John, Praetorian Prefect.
When a special judge has been appointed, either by the emperor or by some other
competent official, in the province in which the person who rejected another
judge resides, and either of the parties says that he suspects him; in order to
prevent the former (when he is absent and resides in another city of the same
province), from being compelled to make a long journey for the purpose of
filing his application for rejection, We direct that, if the Governor of the
province is in the city where the difficulty arises, he who alleges that he
suspects the judge shall appear before him and make the accusation in writing.
Where, however, the Governor of the province is not in the place aforesaid,
this can be done before the defender of the district, or the municipal
duumvirs, after the requisite formalities have been observed, and the judge can
be rejected. And, immediately afterwards, that is to say, within the next three
days, the parties shall be compelled, without delay, to choose an arbiter or
arbiters, and submit their cases to them, in order that the judge who has been
appointed may not be removed, and no other be chosen. Whenever a dispute arises
between the parties with reference to the selection of an arbiter, it shall, in
like manner, be decided by the Governor of the province, if he is present, or
by the defender of the district, or the municipal magistrates; and the court
official to whose care the case has been committed must carry into effect
whatever has been decided by the arbiter, unless an appeal is taken; for then
he who appointed the judge who was considered suspicious, having considered the
application for an appeal, shall render a decision in accordance with law.
Given on the Idesof November, during the Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes,
530.
TITLE II.
CONCERNING THE COSTS AND EXPENSES INCURRED IN DIFFERENT CASES, AND THE
EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE
COURT.
1. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Potitus, Deputy.
When anyone has been summoned to court, We order that the bailiff to whose
charge he is committed shall, in the first place, keep him under observation,
until the case has been terminated. If anyone should, under any pretext,
disobey this Our decree, after it has been
issued the official responsible for it shall be sentenced to pay a fine of five
pounds of gold.
Given at Milan, on the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Ausomius and
Olybrius, 379.
2. The Same to Julian, Praetorian Prefect.
We grant permission to all judges, with the exception of those specially
appointed by Us, who are classed as illustrious, distinguished, or eminent, and
to members of the bar of every prefecture, or any others of those who have been
delegated to hear cases by Our judges, to remove from office any of their
subordinates, if they neglect their duties, and to deprive them of the business
of which they have charge, as well as fill their places with others who are
qualified, and even to impose fines upon them.
If the judges are such as are styled illustrious, they can impose fines up to
six solidi;others, however, can not exceed one of three aurei;and the latter
should send the culprit to competent magistrates in order that they may inflict
corporeal punishment upon them. Our judges of the highest rank shall have
permission to impose even more severe penalties and corporeal punishments upon
the said subordinates when they have been guilty of embezzlement while in
office; in order that they may know that they cannot practice any deception
with reference to litigants, and that the course of justice may not be
obstructed on account of their greed of gain.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Lampadius
and Orestes, 530.
TITLE III. CONCERNING SPECIAL JUDGES.
1. The Emperor Gordian to Vicanius.
It is clear that Our Deputies, when not occupying the place of Governors of
provinces, have no authority to appoint judges to decide disputes between
private persons; and therefore, if (as you allege), he whom you mention has
thought proper to appoint arbitrators to dispose of a controversy between
private persons, any award rendered by them cannot stand under the law.
Given on the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of Atticus and
Praetextatus, 243.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to all Vicegerents.
We desire that Governors should, themselves, take cognizance of cases, which,
for the reason that they were not able to determine them, they formerly
appointed special judges to decide; but, if they cannot hear them on account of
their public duties, or because of the multiplicity of matters of this kind,
they are granted authority to appoint judges to do so. This, however, should
not be understood to mean
that permission is given them to appoint judges in cases which they are
accustomed to hear in the ordinary course of their official duties, for
jurisdiction of these must be retained by the Governors in order to prevent
their authority from appearing to be diminished. The judges, themselves, must
decide cases involving free birth, of which they formerly could take
cognizance, as well as such as have reference to manumission.
3. The Same, and the Caesars, to Serapion.
We desire that you intimate to such judges as you may see fit to appoint that,
after having rendered their decisions, they put an end to the business
entrusted to them, and that in cases in which they should, and can render
judgment, they must not assume authority to assign them to her judges; and
especially where a decision seems to one of the parties litigant to be unjust,
he shall be granted full power to interpose an appeal from the entire decision.
Given at Antioch, on the eighth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of
the Caesars, 294.
4. The Same, and the Caesars, to Firminus.
We desire that, whenever special judges have been appointed, after issue has
been joined in a case, and they have necessarily been compelled to take charge
of some other business, or to go into another province for some reason
connected with the public welfare, or have died, and on this account the
matters which have been begun cannot be terminated, other judges should be
appointed in their stead, who may dispose of the unfinished litigation; lest
otherwise some impediment may arise in the administration of justice.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof ..., during the Consulate of Tiberius and
Maximus, 295.
5. The Emperor Julian to Secundus, Praetorian Prefect.
There are certain matters which it would be superfluous to bring before the
Governor of a province, and therefore We grant authority to Governors to
appoint special judges, that is to say, such as may decide questions of minor
importance.
Given at Antioch, on the fifth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of
Mamertinus, 362.
TITLE IV.
WHAT JUDGES CAN DELEGATE THEIR JURISDICTION, AND WHO CAN BE DELEGATED.
1. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Cyrus, Praetorian Prefect.
In the delegation of cases, We order that it shall, by all means, be remembered
that only such appointments are valid which come within the jurisdiction of the
judge who makes them, for if anyone
should think that he has a right to delegate a case belonging to another
jurisdiction, We decree that the person appointed need pay no attention to the
order; and if he obeys the official who appointed him contrary to law, We
direct that everything which has been done under said appointment shall be
considered void, just as if those judges who were delegated had themselves
assumed another jurisdiction, so that no necessity exists for the defeated
parties to appeal from their decisions.
These rules shall apply unless judges have been especially delegated by Us, and
have themselves assigned cases to be heard by others; for, where such persons
have been delegated, appeals can only be made from them to Us, without any
distinction of persons or cases.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Valentinian and Anatolius, 440.
TITLE V.
No ONE SHALL DECIDE HIS OWN CASE OR INTERPRET THE LAW FOR HIMSELF.
1. The Emperors Valens, Gratian, and Valentinian to Gracchus, Urban Prefect.
We decree by this general law that no one shall act as judge in his own case,
or interpret the law for himself, as it would be very unjust to give anyone the
right to render a decision in an affair which is his own.
Given on the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of Valens, Consul for the
sixth time, and Valentinian, Consul for the second time, 378.
TITLE VI.
WHO HAVE THE RIGHT TO APPEAR IN COURT, AND WHO HAVE NOT.
1. The Emperor Gordian to Candida.
If, at a time when you were still a minor, you appeared in court with your
adversary, without the authority of your guardian, and the Governor of the
province rendered a decision against you, it will have no judicial authority.
Given on the Idesof December, during the Consulate of Gordian and Aviola, 240.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Gemacha.
In matters relating to a private right, a ward can sue and be sued by his
guardian, and an adult can both bring and defend a suit with the consent of his
curator.
Given on the ninth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 294.
3. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Julian, Proconsul of Africa.
An action to obtain temporary possession can be brought by anyone, but a
petition to recover property under the pretext of obtaining possession should
not be productive of injury, especially when the action appears to have been
begun by someone not legally qualified to do so; for any business transacted
directly with a minor will be of no advantage to him, as this should be
attended to by his curator.
Given at Ravenna, on the second of the Nonesof March, during the Consulate of
Constantius and Constantine, 339.
TITLE VII.
No ONE SHALL BE COMPELLED AGAINST HIS WILL TO BRING AN ACTION, OR TO ACCUSE
ANOTHER.
1. The Emperor Diocletian to Camerius.
No one shall be forced to bring a suit, or to accuse anyone, against his will.
Given on the Idesof October, during the Consulate of Carinus, Consul for the
second time, and Numerianus, 282.
TITLE VIII. CONCERNING THE ORDER OF JUDGMENTS.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Marcellina and Others.
Go before the Governor of the province, and inform him that the will of Favius
is broken by the birth of a posthumous son. Nothing will prevent him from
taking cognizance of the case, which involves the question of status, although
he cannot usually examine matters of this kind; as this is part of the duty of
the judge having jurisdiction of estates, and of every incidental question
relating to the same, for he does not determine the condition of the person but
that of the estate.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of Geta
and Plautian, 204.
2. The Emperor Antoninus to Magnilla.
If no question is raised with reference to your condition by those whom you
allege to be your first cousins, application must be made to the Governor of
the province, in order that an action in partition may be brought. If, however,
any doubt as to your status exists, the said illustrious official shall, in the
first place, and in accordance with the formalities of the law, examine the
truth of your birth.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Antoninus,
Consul for the fourth time, and Albinus, 214.
3. The Emperors Valerian and Galliemis to Demetrius.
When a criminal question arises in the discussion of a civil one, or where a
criminal prosecution having been begun a civil suit is added to it, the judge
must dispose of both at the same time.
Given on the Nonesof ..., during the Consulate of Gallienus, Consul for the
fifth time, and Faustinus, 203.
4. The Emperor Constantine to Calphurnius.
When, during a civil investigation, as frequently happens, a criminal
accusation is first examined, as a matter of greater importance takes
precedence of ones of less; therefore, the criminal charge having been disposed
of, the civil case should be definitely decided, so that the termination of the
criminal prosecution may date from the day on which the civil action was begun,
and judgment be rendered between the parties.
Given on the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Nepotian and Facundus, 336.
TITLE IX. CONCERNING JOINDER OF ISSUE.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Valens.
A case is not considered as actually brought into court where only a simple
demand is made, or where the defendant is notified beforehand of the action to
be instituted against him; as a great difference exists between the joinder of
issue and the origin of a suit, for issue is considered to be joined only when
the judge begins to hear the cause of action discussed.
Given on the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of Severus, Consul for
the third time, and Antoninus, 201.
Extract from Novel 53, Chapter HI. Latin Text.
Notice is served upon the party who is summoned to court, and then, after the
plaintiff has deposited the costs and furnished security, the defendant will be
entitled to twenty days during which to make up his mind whether he will pay
the claim, or contest it, or whether he will reject the judge, or ask that
another be associated with him, unless the judge is one whom he himself has
already petitioned for, after having rejected the first. Then the party "who is
present is asked whether the time to plead has passed, which ought to be shown
not only by his answer, but also by the date of the summons. This is the first
thing to be done. When issue is joined without the observation of this
formality, it must be considered of no effect.
Extract from Novel 96, Chapter I. Latin Text.
The plaintiff shall not serve the notice before furnishing security to the
party whom he alleges to be liable, and to the bailiff in charge
that, if issue should not be joined within two months, he will pay the
defendant double the amount of damages which he has sustained, the sum
specified in the bond, however, should not exceed thirty-six aurei.
TITLE X. CONCERNING CLAIMS FOR MORE THAN IS DUE.
1. The Emperor Justinian to John, Praetorian Prefect.
With the intention of abolishing the odious subtleties of contracting parties,
We order that if anyone, when a certain amount is due to him, should
fraudulently and deceitfully exact security for a larger sum, and cite his
debtor to court, and then, before the case is heard, repent of his knavery, and
acknowledge the true amount of the claim, he shall not be put to increased
expense. Where, however, proceedings have been begun, and it is proved during
the trial that a false amount has been added, the plaintiff shall not only be
deprived of it, but shall also lose the entire debt; still, if a compromise or
a subsequent admission was made, whether it has been recorded or not, it shall,
in this instance, be confirmed, for such agreements must not be violated.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of
Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
TITLE XI. CONCERNING DELAYS.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, say:
As it frequently happens that a judge is through necessity compelled to grant
delay in order to insure the production of either documents or persons, it is
proper that the time demanded for their production should be granted. If the
persons or papers asked for are in the province where suit was brought, not
more than three months should be granted; if, however, they are in any of the
adjoining provinces, it is in accordance with justice for six months to be
allowed. When they are beyond sea, a delay of nine months should be given.
This having .been determined, the judges should know that under the rule they
are not permitted to grant delays arbitrarily, and they are hereby notified
that where the urgency of the case, and the necessity of obtaining the desired
information demand such a step, delay should not be granted more than once,
nor, under any pretext, be prolonged.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 294.
2. The Emperor Constantine to Ursus, Deputy.When anyone presents a rescript to
a specially appointed judge, a delay shall be absolutely refused him, but it
must be granted to a
person summoned to court for the purpose of proving its falsity, whether it
authorizes the production of certain documents or witnesses, as he who,
contrary to his expectations, has been brought before another judge could not
have been informed.
Given on the second of the Nonesof March, during the Consulate of Volusianus
and Annianus, 314.
Extract from Novel 53, Chapter I. Latin Text.
Recourse to another judge should not be had unless the plaintiff furnishes
security to pay a certain sum if he does not try the case, or if, having done
so, he fails to gain it. Therefore, if he should not proceed within ten days
after the time prescribed, and the defendant is present, the latter shall be
discharged, and the sum promised shall be exacted, if the defendant should
swear that he has not expended more in the case than was included in the
estimate of the judge.
3. The Same to Profuturus, Prefect of Pannonia.
Whether the delay is granted for a portion of the prescribed term, or for all
of it, the judge should remain inactive until the time requested has elapsed.
Holidays, whether they are unusual or established, are, however, not excepted
from the term of the delay, but are included in it.
Given on the seventh of the Idesof February, during the Consulate of Licinius,
Consul for the fifth time, and Crispus, 318.
4. The Same to Catullianus, Proconsul of Africa.
It is not proper to ask a judge for delay during the proceedings, even if it
should be granted while both parties are present, for this cannot be done
unless proper cause is shown, which it is preferable to ascertain by judicial
consideration of the matter, rather than through general inquiry; and if the
demand for delay should be opposed by the adverse party, the question must be
decided by the court.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof February, during the Consulate of Licinius and
Crispus, 318.
5. The Same to Maximus, Praetorian Prefect.
When a rescript has been issued by Us on an appeal, or on an application for an
opinion, whether delay was asked for at the time of the first judgment and was
not accorded, or whether it was not applied for at all, no one is permitted to
grant it, as it is not customary for Us to do so, when We take cognizance of a
case.
Given at Rome, on the eighth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of
Probrian and Julian, 322.
6. The Emperors Constantine, Constans, and Constantius to Petronius, Vicegerent
of Africa.
When proceedings are instituted between private persons and the Treasury, the
right to petition for delay, when exercised by their defenders, is not denied
either party, if good reason exists for demanding ,it.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof April, during the Consulate of Acindynus and
Proculus, 340.
7. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Messala, Praetorian Prefect.
A delay of more than nine months for the purpose of producing documentary
evidence, or obtaining the presence of persons beyond sea, should not be
granted to the parties in a suit where civil condition, or a patrimonial estate
is involved.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of Eutropius
and Theodore, 399.
TITLE XII. CONCERNING FESTIVALS.
1. The Emperors Constantius and Maximian, and the Caesars, Severus and Maximian,
to Verinus.
As you ask, my dear Verinus, whether the same rule should be observed, so far
as the times of appeal are concerned, that apply to the festivals established
by Us to celebrate the occurrence of fortunate events, We are pleased to answer
you that you should, where cases are appealed, observe the prescribed terms in
their regular order, without the addition of days of this kind, for, under such
circumstances, additions cannot be made to the observance of the days
aforesaid.
2. The Emperor Theodosius to Vicenus.
Although it is lawful to manumit and emancipate on Sunday, other business or
litigation cannot be attended to on that day. The harvest festival extends from
the eighth day of the Kalendsof July until the Kalendsof August; and permission
is given to institute proceedings in court from the Kalendsof August until the
tenth of the Kalendsof September. The festival of the vintage lasts from the
tenth of the Kalendsof September until the Idesof October. We desire the Holy
Festival of Easter, that of the Epiphany, and the birthday of Our Lord, as well
as the seven days which precede, and the seven which follow, to be quietly
observed; and anything which is done in violation of this provision shall be
absolutely void.
3. The Emperor Constantine to Elpidius.
Let all judges, the people of cities, and those employed in all trades, remain
quiet on the Holy Day of Sunday. Persons residing in the country, however, can
freely and lawfully proceed with the cultivation of the fields; as it
frequently happens that the sowing of grain or the planting of vines cannot be
deferred to a more suitable day, and by making concessions to Heaven the
advantage of the time may be lost.
Given on the Nonesof March, during the Consulate of Crispus and Constantine,
Consuls for the second time, 311.
4. The Same to Severus.
No judge shall presume to appoint festival-days by his own authority. Such
festivals as a ruler establishes shall be called Imperial holidays, and
therefore if they are deprived of the name they should also be deprived of the
benefit.
Given during the Ides of April . . .
5. The Emperors Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian to Olybrius.
You must proceed with criminal and fiscal cases during the two months of
festivals, that is to say, without any interruption.
(1) Hereafter, also, during these same days, examination shall be made of
matters in which bakers are interested.
Given on the fourth of the Nonesof May, during the Consulate of the Noble
Prince Valentinian, 368.
6. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Lucianus, Vicegerent of
Macedonia.
Every investigation of criminal matters shall be prohibited during the four
days which precede the auspicious season of the ceremonies of Easter.
Given at Thessalonica, on the sixth of the Kalendsof April, during the
Consulate of Gratian, Consul for the sixth time, and Theodosius, Consul for the
first time.
7. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Albinus, Urban
Prefect.
We order that all days shall be proper for the administration of justice, and
that only those shall be considered holidays, which, during the two festival
months, the year seems to set apart for rest from labor; that is, the days of
summer, in order to be better able to endure the heat; and those of autumn, for
the purpose of gathering fruit.
We also devote to leisure the days of the Kalendsof January, which it is
customary to observe for this purpose, and to these We add the days of the
foundation of the great cities of Rome and Constantinople, during which the
administration of justice should be suspended, because it owes its origin to
them. We include in the same category the sacred day of Easter, and the seven
which precede and follow it; the day of the Nativity, and that of the
Epiphanies of Christ; and the time when the commemoration of the Apostolic
Passion of all Christianity is properly celebrated by the entire world.
During the above-mentioned most holy days, We do not permit any public
exhibitions to be given. The day sacred to the sun, to which the ancients very
properly gave the name of Sunday, which returns after a certain period of
revolution, must also be respected, so that there shall be no investigation of
legal disputes on that day, either before arbitrators or judges, whether they
have been appointed or voluntarily chosen.
This rule shall also apply to the days which We first saw the light, or which
witnessed the origin of the Empire. During the fifteen days
of the celebration of Easter, compulsory distribution of provisions and the
collection of all public and private obligations shall be postponed.
Given at Rome, on the second of the Idesof August, during the Consulate of
Timasius and Promotus, 389.
8. The Same to Tatian, Praetorian Prefect.
All employments, whether public or private, shall be suspended during the
fifteen days of the Festival of Easter; still, every person shall have the
right of emancipation and manumission during that time, and any proceedings
relating to them are not prohibited.
Given on the Kalendsof January, under the Consulate of Arcadius, Consul for the
second time, and Rufinus, 392.
9. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Anthemius, Praetorian Prefect.
The Governors of provinces are notified that, so far as the torture of robbers,
and especially of Isaurians is concerned, they must not think that any of the
forty days of Lent, or the venerated Festival of Easter should be excepted,
lest the betrayal of the designs of the criminals, which might be obtained by
torture, may be deferred. This should the more readily be accomplished, as,
during this time, there is greater hope of pardon by the Almighty, and the
health and safety of many persons are secured.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifth of the Kalendsof March, during the
Consulate of Bassus and Philip, 408.
10. The Emperors Leo and Anthemius to Armasius, Praetorian Prefect.
We do not wish holidays dedicated to the majesty of God to be employed in
public exhibitions, or be profaned by any annoyances resulting from
collections.
(1) Hence We decree that Sunday shall always be honored and respected, and
exempt from all executions. No notice shall be served upon anyone; no security
shall be exacted; bailiffs shall remain quiet; advocates shall cease to conduct
cases, and this day shall be free from the administration of justice; the harsh
voice of the public crier shall be silenced; litigants shall have a respite
from their disputes, and enjoy the interval of a truce; adversaries may
approach one another without fear; repentance will have an opportunity to
occupy their minds, they can enter into agreements and discuss compromises.
We do not permit persons who are at leisure during this sacred day to devote
themselves to obscene pleasures; and no one shall then demand theatrical
exhibitions, the contests of the circus, or the melancholy spectacle of wild
beasts; and when Our birthday happens to fall on Sunday, its celebration shall
be postponed. If anyone should think that upon this holiday he can venture to
interest himself in exhibitions; or the subordinate of any judge, should, under
the protest of any public or private business, violate the provisions of this
law, he
shall suffer the loss of his employment and the confiscation of his property.
Given at Constantinople, on the Idesof September, during the Consulate of Zeno
and Martian, 469.
TITLE XIII.
CONCERNING THE JURISDICTION OF ALL JUDGES AND THE COMPETENCY OF TRIBUNALS.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Severus and Others.
Our Procurator was not a competent judge in this matter where only the
litigation of private individuals was concerned, but as you yourselves chose
him, and he rendered a decision with the consent of your adversary, understand
that you should not oppose what has been done with your acquiescence, since he
has authority to decide between certain persons, and you, being well aware that
he was not a competent judge in your case, nevertheless selected him.
What you suggest with reference to other similar judges will also apply to
actions brought by a plaintiff, as well as to exceptions interposed by a
defendant.
Given on the second of the Idesof January, during the Consulate of Messala and
Sabinus, 215.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Alexander.
You ask that the order prescribed by law shall be transposed, and that the
plaintiff shall not follow the residence of the defendant, but the defendant
that of the plaintiff; for wherever the defendant has his domicile, or had it
at the time when the contract was made, there alone he must be sued, even
though he afterwards may have changed it.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof October ....
3. The Same to Judea.
The consent of private persons does not render him a judge who has no right to
preside in court, and anything that he decides will not have any judicial
authority.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof January, during the abovementioned
Consulate, 293.
4. The Emperor Constantine to All the People of the Provinces.
No one, after issue has been joined, can question the jurisdiction of an
ordinary judge, and before a decision is rendered, no appeal can be taken to
the Praetorian Prefect, the Count of the East, or any other superior magistrate,
but where an appeal has been taken in accordance with law, it shall be brought
before Our Tribunal.
Given on the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of Bassus and Ablabius,
331.
5. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Vincentius, Praetorian Prefect of the
Gauls.
In criminal matters, the accuser shall follow the residence of the
defendant.
(1) Anyone who has submitted his case, whether it be a civil or criminal one,
to a tribunal which has no right to hear it, or demands a military execution,
if he is the plaintiff, shall be punished with the loss of the action which he
has brought, and if he is the defendant, he shall be considered as condemned.
Tribunes and deputies are hereby notified that they will be liable to capital
punishment, if they permit their own, or any other prohibited military
execution, to take
place.
Given at Milan, on the fifth of the Kalendsof January, during
the Consulate of Lucius, 413.
6. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Anthemius, Praetorian Prefect.
We grant authority to commanders of the army to hear and determine even civil
questions arising between military men, or a civilian plaintiff and a military
defendant, especially when this is done with the consent of the litigants, and
it appears that the military defendant cannot either be produced in court, or
punished by his own judge, if he should be guilty.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate
of Lucius, 413.
7. The Emperor Anastasius to Constantine, Praetorian Prefect.
We consider that those act unjustly and rashly who, while known to exercise
certain professions and occupations, attempt to evade the jurisdiction and
authority of officials having supervision of the said professions or
occupations. Wherefore, We order men of this kind not to reject the authority
of such persons, on account of their military rank or the prerogatives of their
office or dignity; but those who, under the law, belong to some military
organization, or have formerly done so, or who claim any privilege, shall be
compelled to obey such judges in public as well as in private cases, without
interposing any exception, where their jurisdiction extends to the profession
or occupation which the parties practice; with the exception of that of
soldiers (as has already been stated); provided, of course, they obey the
judges within whose jurisdiction the military or civil service in which they
are engaged is situated.
Those who try to violate the provisions of this law shall be deprived of their
military rank, or their civil honors, for being guilty of such an attempt.
TITLE XIV.
WHEN THE EMPEROR TAKES COGNIZANCE OF THE CASES
OF MINORS, WIDOWS, OR OTHER PERSONS WORTHY OF
PITY, THEY SHALL NOT BE COMPELLED TO APPEAR.
1. The Emperor Constantine to Andronicus.
Where anyone has obtained a Rescript from Us against minors, widows, or those
who are worn out and debilitated by chronic disease, the above-mentioned
persons shall not be compelled by any of Our judges to appear before Our
tribunal; but, on the contrary, the case shall be tried in the province in
which the litigant and the witnesses or documents are to be found, and every
precaution shall be taken to prevent the adverse parties from being forced to
leave the province. If, however, the said minors, widows, or other unfortunate
persons should request Our tribunal to decide their cases, especially when they
are in dread of the influence of some powerful individual, their adversaries
shall be obliged to appear before Us.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Optatus
and Paulinus, 334.
TITLE XV. WHERE IT IS NECESSARY TO PROCEED IN CRIMINAL CASES.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Laurina.
It is well known that proceedings in the case of crimes punishable by the laws,
or in an arbitrary manner, should be instituted in the places where the
offences were committed, or begun, or where the guilty parties may be found.
Given on the fourth of the Nonesof October, during the Consulate of Dexter and
Priscus, 194.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Nicea.
He who knowingly sells a freeman is guilty of the crime of kidnapping, and
therefore when the judge having jurisdiction has been applied to by the person
entitled to make complaint, he must take cognizance of the suit in the place
where the man lives who you say sold a boy who was freeborn.
Given on the second of the Nonesof February, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 294.
Extract from Novel 69, Chapter I. Latin Text.
Where anyone has committed an offence in a province, or is a defendant in a
case involving money or connected with crime, whether it has reference to
boundaries, possession, ownership, hypothecation or anything else, or is
implicated in some other matter, it is a well-established principle of law that
he shall be tried where the act was committed, and the right is not barred by
lapse of time. Therefore if both plaintiff and defendant are in the province,
the case shall be heard there without the allowance of any privilege.
If he from whom I have suffered any injury is absent, I will be obliged to sue
the person responsible for it or his curator, to whom time should be given to
permit him to inform the principal in the case. If the latter himself should
not appear, or send anyone to represent him, and he who was first sued is in
court, he shall be condemned, as well as the party who refused to send a
representative, and himself is guilty; for he will be liable out of his own
property if the one who is present should not prove to be solvent.
When, however, he whose duty it is to represent the owner does not appear after
having been summoned by the crier, he shall have judgment rendered against him,
for the reason that his contumacy is considered to take the place of his
presence. But when the plaintiff fails to appear, and the defendant comes, or
sends someone to represent him, the latter should be discharged and be
reimbursed his expenses.
An exception will lie where the case is conducted as a public one, and the
defendant has been notified by an Imperial Rescript to appear before the
Council of the Emperor; or where this is done under the law having reference to
appeals. The time of delay has been fixed by a new constitution at four months,
according to the difference in places, when the province in which the action is
brought is a neighboring one, or either or both of the parties have their
domicile in the middle of it, the time will be four months. If the distance is
greater, it will be six months. If either of the parties resides in Palestine,
or Egypt, or in some other distant country, eight months will be sufficient.
The term of nine months will be granted if either of them lives in the western
or northern regions of the Empire, or in Lybia.
TITLE XVI.
WHERE AN ACTION TO OBTAIN POSSESSION MUST BE
BROUGHT.
1. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Festus, Proconsul of Africa.
Where violence is alleged to have been employed, or temporary possession is
demanded, the judge must decide the case against the party who interrupted the
possession, in the place where the property
is situated.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate
of Gratian and Dagalaiphus, 366.
TITLE XVII.
WHERE THE EXECUTION OF A TRUST SHOULD BE DEMANDED.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Demetrius.There can be no doubt that
the execution of a trust should be demanded in the place where the estate was
left.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of Chilo
and Libo, 205.
TITLE XVIII.
WHERE HE WHO PROMISED TO MAKE PAYMENT IN A CERTAIN PLACE SHOULD BE SUED.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Heraclida.
When anyone binds himself to make payment in a certain place, and he does not
do so in full, if the judge was selected by the parties he can be sued in an
action in another place, and the amount of extra expense incurred by the
plaintiff as estimated by the judge shall be included in this action, on
account of payment having been made in another place than where it was
demanded.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Fuscus and
Dexter.
.TITLE XIX. WHERE AN ACTION IN REM SHOULD BE BROUGHT.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Pancratius.
An action in rem,should not be brought against the vendor, but against the
possessor of the property in dispute. Therefore, it is useless for you to
allege that he who claims the ownership should not bring suit against you, but
against him from whom you obtained it, and this is because you assert that you
are in possession, for if you should have notified the person who sold you the
property, understand that he runs the risk of eviction, for the former
jurisdiction should not be changed when both the plaintiff and possessor reside
in the same province, because you allege that he from whom you obtained the
property resides in another.
Given on the Idesof April, during the Consulate of the abovementioned Emperors,
293.
2. The Emperor Constantine to All the Inhabitants of the Provinces.
When anyone who possesses immovable property, under any title whatsoever, has
an action in rembrought against him, he must immediately state in court who the
owner of the property is, so that, whether he lives in the same town, in the
country, or in another province, a certain number of days may be fixed by the
judge during which he can be notified, and he himself either come or send an
attorney to the place where the land is situated, in order to defend the title
of the plaintiff. If, however, after the time granted has elapsed, he should
prefer to confess judgment, the case will be considered as having been begun on
the day on which the possessor was summoned
to court, which will have the effect of interrupting the prescription of long
time. As the owner of the property did not appear after he had been given time
to do so, the judge shall take care that he shall be summoned in accordance
with the provisions of the law, and if he still remains of the same mind, after
having examined the matter summarily, the judge shall not delay to place the
plaintiff in possession of the property, the right of the absent party with
reference to the principal question always being reserved.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Bassus and
Ablabius, 331.
3. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius.
The plaintiff follows the residence of the defendant, whether the action be a
real or a personal one, but We order that the real action shall be brought
against the possessor in the place in which the property in dispute is
situated.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof July, under the Consulate of Arcadius and
Bauto, 385.
TITLE XX.
WHERE AN ACTION RELATING TO AN ESTATE SHOULD BE BROUGHT, AND WHERE TESTAMENTARY
HEIRS SHOULD DEMAND TO BE PLACED IN POSSESSION OF THE SAME.
1. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus to Messala.
The heirs should demand to be placed in possession of the estate in the place
where you allege that it is situated. The contest should be decided where the
party sued has his domicile, or wherever the property belonging to the estate
may be.
Given on the seventh of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Secularus
and Donatus, 261.
TITLE XXI.
WHERE AN ACTION TO COMPEL THE PRODUCTION OF EITHER PUBLIC OR PRIVATE ACCOUNTS
SHOULD BE
BROUGHT.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Gerontius.
Anyone who has administered the affairs of another, either as a guardian or in
any other fiduciary capacity, must render an account of the same where he
transacted the business.
Given on the seventh of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Annibalio
and Asclepiodotus, 292.
2. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Macedonius, Military Commander.
No one who has been discharged from the army, and, after having returned to
private life, is notified to render an account by a member
of the corps in which he served or which he himself commanded, because of some
business which he attended to while in the service, can avail himself of an
exception; for everyone must defend himself before a military tribunal in all
public matters of this kind, which he had charge of while he was a soldier, or
where he is called upon to render a military account because he is alleged to
have taken advantage of his comrades; and, in an investigation of this kind,
the proceedings must be regular, and the witnesses heard, and the proper
documents produced.
TITLE XXII.
WHERE SUITS WITH REFERENCE TO THE CONDITION OF PERSONS SHOULD BE BROUGHT.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Aurelius Aristocrates.
Your female slave, while in your service, fled and betook herself to another
province, and as she asserts that she is free, it will not be unjust to compel
her to try her case in the place from whence she fled; and therefore the
Governor of the province who administers justice in that locality must take
care to send her back to the province in which she served as a slave, but she
should not be heard in the place where she was seized.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of
Pompeianus and Pelignus, 232.
2. The Emperor Decius to Felix.
It is known to all persons that Our Procurators cannot take cognizance of cases
in which the civil condition of persons is involved.
Given on the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of Decius, Consul for the
second time, and Gratus, 251.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Zenonia.
If you are in the possession of freedom, as the plaintiff must always follow
the residence of the defendant where questions of status are involved, this
action, which relates to liberty, must be brought in the place where the
alleged female slave resides, even though the plaintiff may be invested with
senatorial dignity.
Given on the second of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors, 297.
4. The Same, and the Caesars, to Sizinia.
If anyone who is in slavery asserts that he is free, it is an undoubted rule of
law that the action to establish his status must be brought where the party who
alleges that he is his master has his domicile.
Given at Byzantium, on the second of the Nonesof March, during the Consulate of
the Caesars, 294.
5. The Same, and the Caesars, to Diogenes, Governor of the Islands.
It has already been established by Us that where any case involving freedom and
slavery arises, in the provinces, between the Treasury and private persons, it
must be sent to the Steward or Superintendent of Our Private Affairs, that is
to say, to the place where the controversy originated. If, however, free birth
is involved, it should be investigated by the Governor of the province.
Given on the fourth of the Nonesof August, during the Consulate of the Caesars,
294.
6. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Praetorian Prefect.
We order that in actions in which the question to be decided is whether someone
is freeborn or a freedman, the prescription of five years (after which term the
ancient laws declare that an Imperial Rescript is necessary), shall hereafter
cease to have effect; and proceedings of this kind, after the above-mentioned
term has elapsed, like others which are heard in the provinces before the
Governors, shall, in this Fair City, be decided by competent magistrates of
superior
jurisdiction.
We decree that this rule shall be observed, whether the party is of illustrious
rank or servile condition.
Given on the third of the Nonesof August.
TITLE XXIII.
WHERE ANYONE BELONGING TO THE CURIÆ, OR THE
COURT ATTENDANTS, OR OF ANY OTHER CONDITION,
CAN BE SUED.
1. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Florus, Praetorian Prefect.
If anyone belonging to the curiaeor attached to the office of a judge, or to any
other body, should be arrested in a province by those from whom he was fleeing,
without any notice having been received from the magistrate from whom he
obtained his position by means of corrupt practices, and he is tried before the
judge who has jurisdiction in the place where he was arrested, without any
attention being paid to the exception based on official privilege to which he
is not legally entitled, and he is convicted by satisfactory evidence, he shall
again be placed in the class which he abandoned.
Given at Milan, on the twelfth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of
Caesarius and Atticus.
2. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Cyrus, Praetorian Prefect.
By this permanent law We decree that persons belonging to the curiae,or those
who are said to be employed for the service of the courts, or are members of
other bodies, cannot plead an exception to
the provincial tribunal. The same rule applies to those who are convicted of
extortion or peculation, excepting such as form part of the armed soldiery, or
can defend themselves by a special Rescript of the Emperor.
The name of their curiaeor cohort should be required of military men, in order
that the Governor of the province may send them to your tribunal, to their
commander, or to some other competent authority, and that those who are
demanded as liable may be delivered up to the tribunals of the province, and
may expect the result of the trial where the laws direct questions of this kind
to be determined.
No one shall be permitted to plead the exception where questions of public
duties or debts are involved, except those specially empowered to do so.
We also decree that others cannot reject the jurisdiction of your illustrious
tribunal, or that of the Governors of the provinces, in any matter whatsoever,
so that all who obstinately attempt to violate such a very salutary law as this
may know that sentence for contumacy can be passed upon them by the Governors
of provinces.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of Cyrus,
441.
TITLE XXIV.
WHERE SENATORS OR PERSONS OF ILLUSTRIOUS RANK MAY BE PROCEEDED AGAINST EITHER
CIVILLY OR CRIMINALLY.
1. The Emperor Constantine to Octavianus, Count of the Spains.
Anyone whosoever, that is not of illustrious but of noble rank, who ravishes a
virgin, removes landmarks, or is caught in the act of committing any offence,
or crime, shall be tried in the province in which he perpetrated it, and cannot
avail himself of the jurisdictional exception, for the commission of the
offence destroys the effect of all privileges of this kind.
Given on the day before the Nonesof December, during the Consulate of
Gallicanus and Bassus.
2. The Emperors Valens, Gratian, and Valentinian to the Senate.
In pecuniary cases, senators, whether they reside in this Fair City or in its
suburbs, shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Praetorian Tribunals and
the Urban Prefecture, as well as to that of the Master of the Offices, whenever
We have directed this to be done. If, however, they reside in the provinces,
they shall answer wherever their domicile is, or where the greater part of
their property is situated and they pass the most of their time.
Given on the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Valentinian and
Nepterius, 390.
3. The Emperor Zeno to Arcadiiis, Praetorian Prefect.
If persons who are now, or have formerly been of patrician rank, or who have
administered the Praetorian or Urban Prefectures of this great City, men of
consular dignity, whether they have obtained it in an ordinary manner or by the
special favor of the Emperor, those who have become illustrious through the
exertion of military command, those who have performed the duties of Master of
the Offices, Quaestor, or Imperial Chamberlain, and, having retired, have been
invested with senatorial rank, those whom We have appointed to govern the
Imperial Household, and those to whom We have committed the care of Our
treasures, or of the private affairs of Our most August Consort, after having
relinquished their administration, should be accused of any public or private
offence (which cannot be defended by an attorney), either in this Fair City or
in the provinces, no matter where they may reside, We order that no judge shall
have jurisdiction of such cases, but that cognizance of the same shall belong
to Us alone, or to him to whom by an Imperial Rescript We have delegated Our
authority to hear actions of this kind; so that they may be tried before such a
judge, without the aid of any office or order, according to the custom and
practice of the Imperial regulations, and moreover, without observing the time
allowed for the institution of proceedings; and Our Masters of Requests, having
complied with the ordinary formalities, such cases shall be heard by them. In
order that the person accused of crime may not suffer any injustice before
conviction, he shall have the right to be seated in a certain part of the
court, which is lower than that occupied by the judge, but higher than that
where his accusers are stationed.
(1) We have considered that the privileges attaching to such great offices
should be increased to the extent that, after the crime has once been proved,
We do not grant authority to anyone whom We have appointed as judge to decide
with reference to either person or property, but these appointees, although
they hear the cases instead of the Emperor, shall only be permitted to send Us
a report of the proceedings after the crime which has been brought before their
tribunal has been established, as the right to punish persons of such exalted
rank is only vested in the Emperor.
It is, however, certain that in case the defendant should be acquitted, the
false accusation can be punished in conformity with the laws, without
consulting Us, unless the accuser is of a lower rank than the defendant; for,
in this instance, it is not unreasonable that the Imperial authority should be
consulted as to the punishment of a false charge made by an accuser of this
description.
(2) We also decree that where men of illustrious rank, who reside in this
Renowned City, and who, without having conducted any administration, have been
decorated with honorable titles (even though they may have deserved such a
privilege at Our hands), shall, nevertheless, be considered to have exercised
administrative functions, and shall be subject to the jurisdiction of your
magnificent tribunal, and
to that of the illustrious Urban Prefecture; and also to that of our
distinguished Master of the Offices (whenever a special order committing the
same to him has been issued by Us), in criminal cases, so that persons of this
kind, who have been accused, cannot claim for themselves the right to be seated
during their trials. The judges themselves are hereby notified that they cannot
decide anything with reference to said parties or their property, after the
crimes have been proved, and before they have referred the cases to Us.
(3) Whenever men of illustrious rank residing in the provinces (this, however,
does not apply to those who are not appointed by Us, or hear cases in Our
stead), are accused of criminal offences, they shall have a right, while the
trial is in progress, to sit in the places usually occupied by magistrates, and
if their guilt should be established, the judges must abstain from passing
sentence involving their persons or property, as they are required to report to
Us.
Moreover, where the accusers have been proved to have brought false charges,
the provincial judges shall not delay their punishment; unless, as has
previously been stated, those who were convicted are equal in rank to him whom
they accused.
Given at Constantinople, . . .
TITLE XXV.
IN WHAT CASES SOLDIERS CANNOT AVAIL THEMSELVES OF AN EXCEPTION ON THE GROUND OF
JURISDICTION.
1. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Florentine, Praetorian Prefect.
We order that all persons attached to the domestic service of the Emperor, as
well as those who transact his affairs, and any who profess to belong to some
corps, or to be of a certain rank, shall, so far as public duties are
concerned, be responsible to the Governors of the provinces, and shall have no
right to avail themselves of the exception on the ground of jurisdiction, if
those who are collecting the public debts should attempt to do so. Moreover, We
desire that where men occupied in the transaction of private business, who are
either members of the provincial association, or are protected by their
occupation as farmers of the revenue, but are not enrolled in the army, have
rented land belonging to the Emperor, or to powerful persons, or to anyone
else, no matter what his status may be, shall be subjected to the jurisdiction
of the same judges, unless they can prove that they have obtained leave of
absence for a year for the purpose of attending to their own affairs.
The same rule shall also be observed with reference to those who have obtained
the privilege of trading as soldiers; namely, that they shall only be
responsible to the Governor of provinces.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Kalendsof ..., during the
Consulate of Theodosius, Consul for the seventeenth time, and Festus, 439.
TITLE XXVI.
WHERE CASES RELATING TO THE PUBLIC TREASURY OR
THE IMPERIAL PALACE, OR TO PERSONS ATTACHED TO THE
SAME, SHALL BE BROUGHT.
1. The Emperors Severns and Antoninus to Dioscorus.
Who is ignorant of the fact that the question of avenging the death of a
deceased person should not be investigated by Our Procurators, nor any property
claimed by the Treasury, before proof of the crime has been established in the
presence of the judge who has a right to impose punishment upon the parties,
when convicted? When persons guilty of the homicide are dead, it is clear that
reason will permit the action to be brought before the said Procurators.
Given on the seventh of the Idesof May, during the Consulate of Lateranus and
Rufinus, 198.
2. The Same to Arista.
We do not understand why you desire cases belonging to the jurisdiction of Our
Procurators to be sent to be heard by the Proconsul; for if it is suspected
that your father killed himself through fear of punishment, and, for this
reason, his property should be confiscated to the Treasury, in this instance,
there is no question of crime or the punishment of the deceased, but merely one
involving his estate.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of Aper and
Maximus, 208.
3. The Emperor Antoninus to Heliodorus.
As My Procurator, who does not perform the functions of the Governor of a
province, cannot exact the penalty for abandoning an accusation; so, he cannot,
by his decision, order it to be paid.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of Laetus
and Cerealis, 216.
4. The Emperor Alexander to Maxima.
As you allege that you have purchased certain lands belonging to an estate from
My Procurator, you must necessarily pay the price of the same, but as you say
that you have purchased and delivered the said lands to the persons who
directed you to do so, and you bring suit against them, My Procurator shall
decide the case if you select him for that purpose, so that you can recover the
purchase-money due to you, and the interest owing to the Treasury may be paid.
Given on the fourth of the Idesof October, during the Consulate of Maximus and
Paternus, 224.
5. The Emperor Constantine to Ursus.
The Imperial Accountant shall decide all cases having reference to the
Treasury, and all extortion is prohibited.
Given at Constantinople, on the Nonesof February, during the Consulate of
Felicianus and Titian, 337.
6. The Same to Italicus.
When anyone thinks that an action should be brought against a tenant who has
leased Our property, the case should be referred to the illustrious Count of
Private Affairs, who must render a decision in accordance with his reputation
as a magistrate, and with his duty.
Given during the Kalendsof February, . . .
7. The Same to Bulephorus, Imperial Accountant.
We decree that you shall investigate any controversies arising between the
tenants of the Emperor and those of private persons, for generals and other
commanders of soldiers and camps, as well as Governors of provinces, must
abstain from summoning and bringing tenants into court.
Given on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of
Licinius, 318.
8. The Emperor Constantine to Taurus, Praetorian Prefect.
When a tenant, or a slave belonging to Our private estate, is said to have
perpetrated an act against the public order, he shall be compelled to appear
before the tribunal of the Governor of the province, so that the case between
him and his accuser may be tried in the presence of Our Accountant or the
Steward of the Imperial Household, and if the crime is proved he shall be
punished with the severity prescribed by the law.
Given on the fifth of the Nonesof March, during the Consulate of Arbitio and
Lollianus, 355.
9. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Philip.
Let all persons be assured that, if anyone should be annoyed by some injury
caused by the Steward of Our Private Affairs, or by Our Procurator, complaint
of their insults or depredations shall be brought before your tribunal, or that
of the Governor of the province, and he can, without fear, have recourse to
public vengeance.
When the offence is established by positive evidence, We order and decree that
he who has had the audacity to attempt anything of this kind against anyone
residing in the province shall be publicly burned alive.
Given on the third of the Nonesof July, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors, 368.
10. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Polemius, Praetorian
Prefect.
No one of those employed in the office of the Imperial Accountant, either for
the collection of taxes or the drawing up of documents, shall be brought before
any other tribunal, unless an accusation formulated in accordance with law is
filed against him.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Arcadius and
Bauto, 385.
11. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Artaxus, Imperial Chamberlain.
We order by this law that if any tenant, lessee, or slave belonging to Us,
either accuses, or is accused in a criminal case, or is a party to a civil
suit, the trial of the same shall not take place before any tribunal but yours,
and that of the distinguished Count of Our Household, and that no exception on
the ground of want of jurisdiction shall be permitted.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof April, ...


TITLE XXVII.
WHEN ANYONE MAY BE PERMITTED TO AVENGE HIMSELF OR THE PUBLIC, WITHOUT APPLYING
TO THE JUDGE.

1. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to the People of the
Provinces.
We grant to all persons full authority to defend themselves, so that where any
soldier or nocturnal depredator enters upon the land of aprivate person, or
stops him on the public highway, intending to attack him, everyone shall have
permission to immediately subject him to proper punishment, and he shall suffer
the death which he threatened, and undergo what he expected to inflict, for it
is better to take advantage of the opportunity than to obtain retribution after
death. Therefore, We authorize you to avenge yourselves, and We bring within
the terms of the Edict those whom it would be too late to punish by a judgment;
hence let no one spare a soldier, who must be encountered with weapons in the
same manner as a thief.
Given on the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Tatian and Symmachus, 391.

2. The Emperors Arcadius, Honorius, and Theodosius to Hadrian, Praetorian
Prefect.
We hereby grant legal authority to the inhabitants of provinces to arrest
deserters, and when they dare to resist, We order them to be punished
immediately, wherever they may be. All persons are notified that, for the sake
of the common peace, they have a right to inflict public vengeance upon
robbers, and deserters from the army.
Given on the fifth of the Nonesof October, during the Consulate of Theodosius
and Rumoridius, 391.
TITLE XXVIII. CONCERNING INOFFICIOUS WILLS.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Victorinus.
When a son desires to attack the will of his mother, on the ground of its being
inofficious, it will not be improper for him to bring suit
against the person who has received the estate under the terms of a trust, as
the beneficiary of the same is fully as liable as if he held it as heir, or
possessor.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Falco and
Clarus, 194.
2. The Same to Lucretius.
Although you state that, being about to attack the will as inofficious, you
have obtained possession of the estate, it is, nevertheless, unjust that the
appointed heirs should be deprived of possession.
Given on the fourth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of Dexter
and Priscus, 197.
3. The Same to Januarius.
Where a mother, after having appointed her two sons her heirs, had another son
after making her will, as she could have changed it, but neglected to do so,
the third son, having been passed over without good reason, can institute
proceedings to declare the will inofficious. But as you allege that the woman
died in child-birth, the injustice of the unexpected event should be rectified
by the conjecture of maternal affection. Wherefore We hold that an equal share
of the estate should be given to your son, against whose claim nothing can be
alleged except the fate of his mother, just as if she had appointed all of her
sons her heirs. Where, however, the appointed heirs are strangers, then he will
not be prevented from bringing suit to declare the will inofficious.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Lateranus
and Rufinus, 198.
4. The Same to Soterius and Others.
As you have obtained your freedom under the terms of a trust, and in accordance
with a decree of the Praetor, and as you have afterwards had children; although
the will of your master may, upon the application of your son, have been
pronounced inofficious, it is not just for any question to be raised with
reference to your freedom.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof March, under the second Consulate of Antoninus
and Geta, 106.
5. The Emperor Antoninus to Helius.
If your father, after having brought an action, or after having made up his
mind to attack the will of your brother as inofficious, should die, leaving you
his heir, you will not be prevented from proceeding with the case, which he had
begun, in any way whatsoever.
Given on the second of the Nonesof October, during the Consulate of Gentian and
Bassus, 212.
6. The Same to Ingenuus.
When the question is asked whether sons can attack the will of their father as
inofficious, it should be ascertained whether, at the time of his death, the
testator left them the fourth part of his estate.
Given at Rome, on the seventh of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of
the two Aspers, 213.
Extract from Novel 18, Chapter I. Latin Text.
It is provided by the latest law that, where there are four sons or less, they
can take the third part of the estate of the deceased, but if there are more
than this, they will have a right to half of what is left no matter under what
title, and this share shall be equally divided among them; and that the
children cannot in any way be defrauded of the usufruct by their ascendants.
Extract from Novel 92, Chapter I. Latin Text.
Therefore, if a parent has made an unreasonable donation to one or several of
his or her children, each one will be entitled under the Falcidian Law to as
much of the estate as would have been due to him before the donation was made.
It is, moreover, permitted to him who received it to abstain from laying any
claim to the estate, provided he makes up the shares of the others out of the
donation, if any necessity exists for doing so.
7. The Same to Secundus.
You should not be ignorant that the granddaughter of the deceased can institute
proceedings to declare his will inofficious, even though her father may have
died emancipated.
Given at Rome, on the sixth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of
Laetus and Cerealis, 216.
8. The Emperor Alexander to Florentinus.
The distribution of their estates made by parents between their children should
not be set aside, provided those who know that they were entitled to succeed to
the deceased, if he died intestate, have obtained their fourth by the will of
their father.
(1) He who has accepted the will of the deceased, either through having paid
the indebtedness of his father in proportion to his hereditary share, or by
settling it in any other legal manner, cannot, if he is over twenty-five years
of age, attack as inofficious his father's will, which he accepted, even if
less was bequeathed to him than he was entitled to.
Given on the seventh of the Idesof February, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and Ælianus, 224.
9. The Same to Romana.
. It is a positive rule of law that children cannot attack as inofficious the
will of a soldier, a centurion, or a tribune, whether it was made in accordance
with military or civil law.
Given on the Idesof May, during the Consulate of Maximus, Consul for the second
time, and Ælianus, 224.
10. The Same to Quintinian.
If the property of the heirs of Quintinian (who you say was your father, and
against whose representatives you are about to bring an
action to declare the will inofficious), belonged to the Treasury by the right
of succession, or it holds the property of Quintinian, as being without an
owner, you can bring your action before Our Procurator.
11. The Same to Ingenuus.
Anyone who has not been sentenced to fight in the arena, but has voluntarily
selected that profession, can succeed to an estate as heir at law, as his
rights as a citizen and a freeman remain intact. If, however, his father made a
will, the son cannot call it in question as being inofficious, nor shall he be
entitled to possession of the estate, for the father very properly decided that
his son was unworthy to succeed him, unless he himself was of the same
condition.
Given on the fourth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of Julian,
and Crispinus, 225.
12. The Same to Licinianus and Diogenes.
If the father of the girl whose curator you allege that you are, after having
appointed heirs, that is to say, his son to half his estate, his daughter to a
third, and his wife to the remaining sixth, charged his children that, if
either of them should die before reaching the age of twenty-five years, his or
her share should go to the survivors, and also charged his wife to give to his
children any part of the estate which might come into her hands, you should
not, against the just wish of the testator, bring the action of calumny to
declare the will inofficious, as by a restitution of this kind under the trust,
the share of the mother, as well as that of the brother, will come into the
hands of your ward.
Given on the Nonesof December, during the Consulate of Alexander, Consul for
the third time, and Dio, 236.
13. The Emperor Gordian to Prisciamts.
Two heirs having been appointed, one to five and the other to seven-twelfths of
an estate, you allege that you brought a proper action against the one who was
appointed heir to seven-twelfths, but that you were defeated by the other, and
consequently the will is broken, so far as that portion of it is concerned, as
he who is entitled to the estate ab intestatowill succeed, and neither the
legacies nor the trusts will be due, although the grants of freedom will take
effect directly, and the trusts should be executed.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulship of Gordian
and Aviola, 240.
14. The Same to Priscus.
Where a party litigant has been unable to prove the complaint of
inofficiousness brought against a will, it has been decided that he is not
barred from declaring it to be forged.
The same rule should be observed where, on the other hand, someone has attacked
a will as having been forged, and afterwards desires to bring suit to declare
it inofficious.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of Gordian
and Aviola, 240.
15. The Emperor Philip to Aphrodisia.
It is a settled principle of law that a daughter who has been passed over by
her mother cannot aspire to the succession of the latter without having
previously instituted proceedings to declare the will inofficious.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Philip and
Titian, 246.
16. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus, and the Caesar Valerian, to Theodora.
Where persons over the age of twenty-five years bring two actions attacking a
will, one for the reason that it was not drawn up according to law, the other
that it was inofficious, although it may have legally been executed, the
prescription of five years, dating from the time of the first judgment, does
not run as long as one of the actions remains to be tried.
Given on the Idesof August, under the Consulate of Tuscus and Bassus, 259.
17. The Emperors Carinus and Numerianus to Flora.
When you state that your son, having passed you over, appointed his sister his
heir, you can bring suit before the Governor of the province to declare the
will inofficious.
Given on the second of the Idesof February, during the Consulate of Carinus,
Consul for the second time, and Numerian, 284.
18. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Faustina.
As you say that you have not violated your filial affection, but were unwilling
to separate from your husband whom you had married, and because your father was
angry and irritated on account of this, he disinherited you, you will not be
prevented from filing a complaint against the will as being inofficious.
Given on the Kalendsof May, under the Consulate of Maximus, Consul for the
second time, and Aquilinus, 285.
19. The Same to Apollonarius.
If you think that your daughter should be excluded from your estate because she
lives a dishonorable and shameful life, and if you have not been influenced by
sudden anger to take this course, but your hatred is founded upon reason, you
will be free to make your last will in accordance with your wishes.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors, 293.
Extract from Novel 115, Chapter III. Latin Text.Where, however, you postponed
the marriage of your daughter after she had reached the age of twenty-five
years, and she then com-
mitted sin with her body; or if, without your consent, she married a husband
who is free, you cannot disinherit her.
20. The Same, and the Caesars, to Savianus.
Where a daughter, after her father's death, married with the consent of her
mother, and, living on good terms with her husband, did not offer any reason
for complaint, after her mother had repented of having consented, she cannot be
compelled by law, whether still married, or a widow, to be subject to the
momentary caprices of her mother.
Given on the Nonesof January, during the Consulate of the Caesars, 294.
21. The Same, and the Caesars, to Alexander.
Nephews or nieces, or paternal and maternal uncles or aunts will, in vain,
attack a will as inofficious, as no relative in the collateral line, with the
exception of a brother or sister, is permitted to do so; but they are not
prevented from bringing a criminal accusation alleging that the will is forged.
Given during the Consulate of the Caesars, 294.
22. The Same, and the Caesars, to Tantilla.
If your husband, by his will, appointed you heir to his entire estate, and
disinherited a daughter who was under his control, such a disinheritance will
not be permitted by law, where nothing has been left to her, and she did not
give him any just cause for offence; for there is no doubt that if she should
attack the will as inofficious, she can obtain the entire estate.
Where, however, she has already obtained it, or afterwards brings suit to
recover it, she must surrender to you whatever her husband owed you at the time
of his death.
Given on the Idesof February, during the Consulate of the Caesars, 294.
23. The Same, and the Caesars, to Philip and Others.
As you acknowledge that you prevented your mother from making a will in the
presence of witnesses, you have evidently given just cause for offence.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof September, during the Consulate of the Caesars,
294.
24. The Same, and the Caesars, to Successus.
The will of a soldier, who is a son under paternal control, disposing of his
castrense peculium,cannot be set aside, either by his father or his children,
on the ground of its being inofficious.
Given at Nicomedia, on the third of the Nonesof December, during the Consulate
of the Caesars, 294.
25. The Same, and the Caesars, to Menedotus.It has been established by law that
a mother, who was suspicious of the morals of her husband, could consult the
interests of her chil-
dren by appointing them heirs, under the condition that they were emancipated
by their father; and that if, after this agreement was made, the father did not
comply with the condition, he could not obtain possession of the property in
accordance with the terms of the will, nor could he bring suit in the name of
his children to set aside the will on the ground of inofficiousness, as the
mother had not injured them in any way, but had rather intended to provide for
them; and therefore he should deliver the estate to them.
26. The Same, and the Caesars, to Serapion.
When a son has been appointed heir to three-twelfths of an estate, it is
certain that a direct substitution can legally be made for him by his father,
if he should die before the age of puberty.
Given at Nicomedia, on the fifth of the Kalendsof September, during the
Consulate of the Caesars, 302.
27. The Emperor Constantine to Verinus.
Uterine brothers and sisters are absolutely prohibited from bringing an action
for the purpose of proving the will of a brother or sister to be inofficious.
Blood-relatives, however, whether agnation exists or not, can institute
proceedings on the ground of inofficiousness of the will of a brother or
sister, where the appointed heirs are, even to a slight extent, branded with
infamy or dishonor, or where freedmen have obtained this great favor from their
patrons, being at the same time wholly undeserving of it, except where a slave
has been appointed a necessary heir.
28. The Same to Claudius, Governor of the Province of Dacia.
Children who institute proceedings to declare the wills of their parents
inofficious must show that they have constantly manifested toward them all the
respect which natural affection demands, unless the appointed heirs are able to
prove that the children have been ungrateful to them. Where a mother attacks
the will of her son as inofficious, We order diligent inquiry to be made
whether the latter had any just cause for complaint against his mother, since
he could thus exclude her from the benefit of his last will, as he did not even
leave her his funeral expenses, or the amount to which she legally was
entitled, so that, the will having been set aside, she may obtain the
succession of the estate by law. If, however, she had annoyed her son by
dishonorable acts and indecent machinations, and either openly or secretly had
laid snares for him, or been on terms of friendship with his enemies, and had
so conducted herself with others that she rather appeared to be his enemy than
his mother, and these facts are established, she will be compelled to accept
the will of her son, even against her consent.
Given on the third of the Idesof February, during the Consulate of Crispus and
Constantius-Caesar, Consuls for the second time, 321.
29. The Emperor Zeno to Sebastian, Praetorian Prefect.
As the new constitution of the Divine Leo directs that an antenuptial donation
shall be given to a son, just as a dowry is given to a daughter, We order that
such donations shall be charged to the fourth part to which the son is legally
entitled.
In the same way, when a father or mother gives a dowry for his or her daughter,
or an ante-nuptial donation for their son, or a paternal grandfather or
grandmother gives one for his or her granddaughter or grandson, or a paternal
or maternal great-grandfather or great-grandmother gives one for his or her
great-granddaughter or great-grandson, this dowry or donation shall not be
bestowed upon the parties, but shall be deducted to the fourth part to which
each is legally entitled, if it has been taken from the property belonging to
the estate which is in dispute; and We desire this to be charged in this manner
for the purpose of preventing the will from being attacked as inofficious.
Given on the Kalendsof May, during the second Consulate of the same Emperor,
321.
30. The Emperor Justinian to Menna.
With the intention of treating the wills of testators with every consideration,
We think, nevertheless, that the innumerable pretexts for setting them aside
should be disposed of, in certain cases in which it was formerly customary for
proceedings to be instituted for the purpose of declaring the wills of deceased
persons inofficious, or of annulling them in some other way; but, by this
certain and established law, provision is made for the interests of testators
and their children, as well as for those of other parties who have a right to
bring this same action; so that whether it is or is not stated in the will that
the legitimate portion shall be paid, the will shall be valid; and it shall,
moreover, be lawful for those persons who have the right to attack it as being
inofficious or to set it aside in some other way, to exact what is lacking to
them to make up their legitimate shares, without their being subjected to any
burden or delay; provided that they have not legally been denounced as
ungrateful, that is to say, if the testator did, not declare that they had
manifested ingratitude towards him.
If, however, he did not allude to them as being ungrateful, his heirs shall not
be permitted to accuse them as such, and to introduce a question of this kind.
We establish these rules with reference to persons whom testators have not
mentioned as being ungrateful, and to whom they have left a certain amount of
their estates, either as legacies or trusts, even though the amount may be less
than what they are entitled to by law.
(1) Where, however, they have passed over any such person who was already born,
or who was conceived before the will was made but was still unborn, or to whom
absolutely nothing was left on account of his being disinherited, or having
been otherwise unfavorably mentioned, then We order that the ancient laws shall
apply, and that no innovation or change shall be caused by the present
enactment.
(2) It is clear that whatever property has been obtained as profit from the
estate of the deceased through an employment in the army should be deducted
from the legitimate shares of the children and other persons who formerly had a
right to institute proceedings to declare a will inofficious, and We wish this
to be the case, and that, where a right of this kind can be sold, or if the
soldier should die while in the service, the value of the same shall descend to
his heirs. Therefore, in order that the value of the right which a soldier may
obtain by the death of the testator may be ascertained, and as much may be
charged to his legitimate share as is decided should be given, if he who
acquired the property of the testator had died while holding his rank in the
army, those officials of our Sacred Palace who are designated silentarii1being
alone excepted, to whom are granted special privileges, not only with reference
to other matters, but also concerning money given by their parents for the
purpose of obtaining the above-mentioned military employment; among which
privileges we direct shall be included that such a donation shall not be
deducted from their lawful shares of an estate.

We desire that the preceding regulations shall apply to all other
persons.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof June, under the Consulate of
Justinian, Consul for the second time, 528.
31. The Same to Menna, Praetorian Prefect.
We order that the provisions which We have recently made for the purpose of
protecting wills shall not be readily abrogated, under the pretext that less
than the amount fixed by the Falcidian Law has been left to persons who, in
accordance with former laws, had a right to institute proceedings to declare a
will inofficious; and that wills shall not be placed in danger, but whatever is
lacking to a legitimate share, that is to say, to the fourth part of an
intestate succession, shall only be contributed, those persons being excepted
to whom nothing was left by will, with reference to whom the rights conferred
by former laws shall remain unimpaired.
We order that these regulations shall also apply to wills which are not in
writing.
Given on the second of the Idesof December, during the Consulate of Our Lord
Justinian, Consul for the second time, 328.
32. The Same to Menna, Praetorian Prefect.
As We have established by former enactments that, if less than their legal
shares are left to persons who could, under the ancient laws, bring suit to
declare a will inofficious, it shall be made up to them, in order that the will
may not be set aside on the ground that a smaller sum has been left them than
they were entitled to, We think it should be added to the present law that, if
the rights of those who formerly

whose duty it was, as their name indicates, to maintain silence in its
precincts, and discourage all loud talking or noisy demonstrations. They were
under the command of decurions.  ED.
could bring the above-mentioned action appear to have been impaired by any
conditions, delays, or dispositions which may cause any delay, diminution, or
burden, the said conditions, delays, or dispositions causing such diminution or
burden should be abolished, and that the matter should proceed just as if none
of these things had been inserted into the will.
Given on the second of the Kalendsof April, during the fifth Consulate of
Decius, 529.
33. The Same to Demosthenes, Praetorian Prefect.
Where anyone, by his will, leaves the greater portion of his estate to one of
his children, and the small residue to another, or to others, in order that
there may be no ground for an action to declare the will inofficious, and that
what is left to the heirs either by way of inheritance, or as a legacy or
trust, may take the part of the share to which they are entitled by law, if he
who obtains the smaller portion is willing to accept it, and the one who has
been left the larger one (whether there be one alone, or several), refuses to
deliver what the others are entitled to, without contention or delay, but
compels them to go into court, and causes many and various disputes to arise
with reference to the same, and, after a long lapse of time, reluctantly
surrenders the property in compliance with the judgment, We intend that such
cruelty shall be punished by a suitable penalty; hence, where a case of this
kind occurs, the offender shall not only be condemned to relinquish what the
testator wished him to give up, but also the third part of an equal amount
which was left by will, which he shall be compelled to surrender under all
circumstances, in order that his avarice may be punished by the power of the
law; and all other matters which have been included in the same will, whether
it be written or not, shall be carried into effect as therein provided.
(1) We have addressed Ourselves to the promulgation of this law for the purpose
of remedying the injustice of former legislation, and that the former
objectionable rule, which Julius Paulus mentions in his Book of Questions, may
no longer be a source of reproach. For he stated that a child could not be
accused by its mother of being ungrateful, and could not, for this reason, be
excluded from her estate, unless she did so through dislike to her husband, by
whom the said child was begotten; and We considering it to be unjust that
anyone should suffer from hatred entertained toward another, order that this
rule shall be abolished; and We do not permit any reason of this kind to be
advanced either against children of tender age, or against others of any age
whatever, as a mother can leave her estate to her son under the condition of
his being emancipated, and, in this way, gratify her aversion to his father,
and not injure the rights of her child, or show herself lacking in natural
affection, for it seems to Us to be cruel for anyone to be considered
ungrateful who has not yet the power to form an opinion.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalends ofOctober, during the Consulate of Decius,
Consul for the fifth time, 529.
34. The Same to John, Praetorian Prefect.
Where anyone disinherits his son, and appoints a foreign heir, but leaves a
grandson by the son aforesaid, who is either already living or as yet unborn,
and while the appointed heir is deliberating whether to accept the estate, the
disinherited son should die without having made, or prepared to make a claim
for the estate on the ground that the will is inofficious, he deprives the
grandson of all opportunity for relief, as the father of the latter, at the
time of his death, did not leave him any recourse against the will of his
father, because after the estate was entered upon by the foreign heir, his
father survived his grandfather, and the grandson could not, under the terms of
the Velleian Law, succeed his father and thereby rescind the will; and some
jurists, in discussing this point, have sustained this inhuman opinion.
We, however, who think We entertain paternal affection and feeling for all Our
subjects, and Our children and grandchildren, and, as far as possible, having a
view to the advantage of all, do hereby order that, in cases of this kind,
every right shall be conferred upon a grandson to which the son was entitled;
and although no preparation may have been made for bringing an action to
declare the will inofficious, a grandson can, nevertheless, bring this action,
and if the heir does not prove by perfectly conclusive evidence that the father
of the grandson was ungrateful towards the testator, the will having been set
aside, the grandson shall be called to the succession as intestate, unless a
certain amount was left to his father which was less than the share to which he
was entitled; for then, in accordance with the New Constitution which We have
promulgated, the grandson can have the deficiency of the fourth part made up to
him, if his father had not already received it, so that he may enjoy the
benefit that We confer, a privilege which indeed, neglected in ancient times,
has been established by Our authority, unless the father, during his lifetime,
either rejected his right to bring suit to declare the will inofficious, or
remained silent for five years from the day when the estate was entered upon.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Lampadius
and Orestes, 530.
. 35. The Same to Julian, Praetorian Prefect.Whenever the permission of the
Emperor is given to anyone freely to make a will, he is considered to have
granted nothing more than that the party in question may enjoy the legal and
ordinary testamentary right; for it must not be believed that the Roman
Emperor, who maintains the laws, would, by a concession of this kind, intend to
overthrow all the regulations relating to wills which have been devised and
framed with so much care.
(1) We also decree that, if anyone should receive a certain sum of money, or a
certain amount of property from his father, and agrees that he will, under no
circumstances, bring suit to declare his will inofficious, and, after the death
of his father, the son, having examined
his will, should be unwilling to accept it, and should think that it ought to
be contested, an opinion was given by Papinianus in which he stated that a son
ought, by no means, to be oppressed by an agreement of this kind, but that
children should rather be induced to show respect to their parents than be
restrained by contracts.
We adopt this opinion, unless the son should have made a compromise with the
heirs of his father in which he clearly accepted the will of the latter.
(2) And, generally speaking, We say that when a father leaves his son a smaller
share of his estate than that to which he is legally entitled, or gives him
something either by a donation mortis causaor by one inter vivos,under the
condition that the donation inter vivosshall be deducted from his lawful
fourth, and the son, after the death of his father, simply acknowledged what
was left or donated to him, or executed a release to the heirs for the same,
but did not add that he would not raise any question with reference to what he
was entitled to make up his lawful share, he does not prejudice his rights in
any way, but can demand the deficiency, unless he expressly stated in writing
either in the release or the compromise, or otherwise agreed, that he would be
content with the share which had been left or given to him, and would make no
demand for what was lacking; for then, all ground for complaint having been
removed, he should be compelled to accept his father's will.
(3) This law shall extend not only to sons and daughters, but also to all other
persons who have a right to institute proceedings, to declare the last
testaments of deceased persons inofficious.
Given on the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of Lampadius and
Orestes, 530.
36. The Same to John, Praetorian Prefect.
We know that before the promulgation of the constitution by which it was
provided that if a father left his son a smaller share of his estate than he
legally was entitled to, although it may not have been added that the balance
owing to him should be granted in accordance with the judgment of a reliable
citizen, the deficiency will be due and payable by operation of law. Hence,
when anyone accepted property which had been donated either inter vivosor
mortis causa,or by legacies, or under the terms of a will, and kept it as his
share, and the property was afterwards evicted, either wholly or in part, the
question arose whether, in accordance with the terms of Our Constitution, the
lawful share should be made up after eviction, or whether the legacies, trusts,
or donations mortis causashould be diminished in accordance with the Falcidian
Law, so that, in this instance, a reserve might be established to prevent the
heir, if he attempted to obtain all of the Falcidian portion, from losing the
entire benefit of the estate.
Therefore, We order that, in all these cases, the defect shall be corrected
whether there is total or partial eviction, and that either other property or
money shall be given, or the deficit made up, without taking into consideration
the Falcidian portion; so that whether there
was something lacking in the beginning, or some other outside cause had arisen
for imposing the burden on the property, either with reference to the amount,
or the time, the deficiency shall by all means be made up, and the privilege
which We have granted be enjoyed by the children without modification.
The deficit should be made up from the property forming part of the estate of
the father, but not where the son has acquired anything from other sources,
either through substitution, or by the right of accrual, as, for instance,
through usufruct. For the sake of humanity, We order that he shall enjoy the
benefit of all property which he may have acquired from foreign sources, and
that the deficiency shall be made up only from that which belonged to his
father.
(1) Where anyone, after having appointed a stranger his heir, provided by his
will that at the time of his death his estate should be transferred to his son,
or postponed such delivery to a specified date, for the reason that Our
previously promulgated Constitution sets forth that all delay and hindrance
with reference to the Falcidian portion shall be abolished, and that the said
fourth part shall be immediately given to the son, a doubt arose as to what
course should be taken in a case of this kind. Hence, We now order that the
restitution of the aforesaid fourth shall immediately take place, without
waiting for the death of the heir, or for the expiration of any term, and that
any balance remaining after the payment of the lawful share shall be delivered
at the time fixed by the testator, so that the son may, in this way, receive
his share intact, as has been established by Our laws and Constitutions; and
the appointed heir may legally enjoy the benefit of what was left to him by the
testator.
(2) Moreover, We order that the time for filing a complaint on the ground that
the will is inofficious, after the estate has been entered upon, shall be in
conformity with the decision of Ulpianus; and that the opinion of Herennius
Modestinus, who declared that the time for the bringing of such an action
should date from the death of the testator, must be rejected; so that an heir
shall not be permitted to enter upon an estate whenever he pleases, in order
that a son may not, by a device of this kind, be defrauded of that to which he
is naturally entitled.
Therefore, We order that when a testator dies after having appointed a foreign
heir, and it is expected that a suit to declare the will inofficious will be
filed, the appointed heir  if there is one residing in the same province 
shall be required within six months, or if he resides in another province,
within a year from the time of the death of the testator, to declare his
intention of either accepting or rejecting the estate; and that when the said
term has elapsed, the son shall have the right to bring the above-mentioned
action. Where the appointed heir does not accept the estate within the
specified time, he shall be forced to do so by the judge. If, however, in the
meantime, the son should die, that is to say, after the date of the death of
the testator, but before the estate has been entered upon, he will transmit
a right of action of this kind to his descendants, although he may not have
been prepared to assert it; but, in accordance with the ancient authorities, he
will not transmit it to foreign heirs, excepting where he had previously made
arrangements to proceed.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof September, after the fifth Consulate
of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
37. The Same to John, Praetorian Prefect.
As it was stated by the ancient laws that military wills were not liable to
proceedings to declare them inofficious, many other instances arose in which it
was necessary to dispose of doubtful questions which presented themselves. For
in cases involving castrense peculium,another division was introduced, for
peculiumwas found to be derived from three different sources, as it was either
civil, acquired through military service, or occupied a middle place between
the two, and was designated quasi castrense.When the peculiumcalled quasi
castrensewas involved, permission was granted to certain persons to dispose of
it by will, but not as soldiers, in any way they chose, but by observing the
common, legal, and customary formalities which have been established with
reference to Proconsuls, the prefects of legions, the governors of provinces,
and, generally speaking, all those who have been appointed by Us to different
offices or employments, or who receive certain salaries from public sources;
for persons of this kind have testamentary capacity solely for the purpose of
disposing of the peculiumjust mentioned, that is to say, the quasi
castrense.Veterans, however, who have acquired peculiumduring their time of
service, after they have left the army, are not prohibited from making wills,
but they must do so in the regular manner. Therefore, when with reference to
all these quasi castrense peculiumsa doubt arose whether wills disposing of
property of this kind could be attacked on the ground of inofficiousness, the
first question to be decided was whether all those who had quasi castrense
peculiumcould bequeath it, for the reason that this was granted as a privilege
only to certain persons, and not to everyone indiscriminately; as soldiers and
veterans had been everywhere permitted to make wills disposing of their
castrense peculium;but while soldiers in active service could do so by virtue
of their own exclusive right, veterans were only entitled to dispose of their
peculiumunder the rules of the Common Law.
It was also doubted whether other persons, upon whom this special privilege had
not been conferred, could bequeath their peculiumby will; as, for instance,
advocates, clerks of courts, those who have charge of the property of others,
as well as professors of liberal arts, physicians, and all persons who receive
public salaries or allowances.
(1) Hence We order that such persons can make testamentary disposition of what
composes their quasi castrense peculium,for the reason that it has been
established in imitation of the peculium castrense,provided this is done
strictly in accordance with law, but
only where the property in question forms part of the quasi castrense peculium.
This privilege is granted to them in order to avoid suit being brought to
declare their wills inofficious; for where a freedman, who was undoubtedly his
own master, has acquired any property while in camp, his patron has not,
according to the tenor of the ancient laws, any right to the possession of such
property, even if he should be passed over by his ungrateful freedman in his
will; and, as this is the case, why should the peculiumswhich have been
introduced in imitation of the castrensebe liable to the complaint of
inofficiousness?
(2) This rule, however, shall be observed until those in possession of the
castrense peculiumhave returned to the homes of their relatives; for if they
should become their own masters, there is no doubt that their wills disposing
of property which formerly constituted their castrense peculiumcan be attacked
on the ground of inofficiousness, as the distinctive name of peculiumno longer
exists, and what it represents is merged in other property, and is subject to
the same fate as that which was collected from all other sources into a single
estate.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof September, after the fifth Consulate
of Lampadius and Orestes, 532.
TITLE XXIX. CONCERNING INOFFICIOUS DONATIONS.
1. The Emperor Philip to Nicanor and Papiana.
If, as you allege, your mother, for the purpose of avoiding an action to
declare the disposition of her property inofficious, exhausted almost all of it
while she was alive, by making donations either to certain children or to
strangers, and after having appointed you heirs to two-twelfths of her estate,
still further exhausted the two-twelfths aforesaid, by means of legacies and
trusts, you do not unjustly ask that relief be granted you by means of
proceedings to declare the will inofficious, inasmuch as you did not receive
the fourth part of the estate to which you were entitled.
Given on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of
Philip and Titian.
2. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus to Acria.
If your father, induced by a certain impulse of boundless generosity, bestowed
all of his estate upon his son, whether he was under his control or not, and
agreed that the arbitrator appointed for the purpose of making partition should
give you the fourth part of the share which you would have received in case of
intestacy, without deduction; or if the son had been emancipated, and for this
reason the donation did not then require any other support, but in accordance
with the Imperial Constitutions, relies upon its own force, the Governor of the
province will assist you to proceed against the donation in the same way as
against an inofficious will.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and Glabrio, 257.
3. The Same to Ælianus.
The Rescripts attached to your petition show that those parents who, during
their lifetime, exhausted their estates by extravagant donations, after having
executed wills, left merely an empty name to their heirs, and the same rule of
equity should apply in this case as in that where persons die intestate.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of the same
Emperors; the first, Consul for the fourth time, and the second, Consul for the
third time, 258.
4. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Aristina.
If your son has exhausted his estate through unbounded liberality, invoke the
aid of the Governor of the province, who, after having ascertained the truth of
the case, will determine whether you are entitled to complete restitution on
account of the enormous amount of the donation made by your son, and will grant
you relief by annulling everything which has been improperly done; and
therefore, it will not be necessary for you to proceed against this
unreasonable donation, as you would in case you desired to establish the
inofficiousness of a will.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof February, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and Acquilinus, 286.
5. The Same to Cotabeus.
If you have exhausted all your property by donations conferred upon your
emancipated son, the amount which will be necessary to leave to children, who
have not been ungrateful, for the purpose of avoiding proceedings to declare
the will inofficious, must be deducted from the donations already made and
restored to your estate; so that any sons or grandsons subsequently born during
lawful marriage, may obtain the amount of property to which they will be
entitled.
Given on the second of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and Acquilinus, 286.
6. The Same to Demetriana.
As you state that the property of your father has been exhausted by donations
made to your brothers, and that the remainder has been divided between you by
codicils executed by him; if you did not know his intention, and could not
avail yourself of the benefit of age, so as to institute proceedings, the dowry
given by your father, or the trust left by him for your benefit, are not
sufficient to prevent you from bringing suit to declare the will inofficious;
and the Governor of the province shall exert his authority to enable you to
proceed against these excessive donations, in the same way as against an
inofficious will.
Given on the Kalendsof May, during the above-mentioned Consulate, 286.
7. The Same to Ammiamis.
If your mother has so exhausted her estate by her profuse liberality to your
brothers that half of the fourth share, which would have been sufficient to
prevent you from attacking the will as inofficious, was not included in the
donations which she gave you, the unreasonable amount which she has bestowed
shall be revoked.
Given on the fifth of the Ides ofMay, during the above-mentioned Consulate,
286.
8. The Same to Auxanonus.
If it can be proved that your mother, in order to prevent you from bringing an
action to declare her will inofficious, exhausted her estate in donations made
to one of her sons, as reason demands that the right to bring suit for
inofficiousness should be accorded, in order to frustrate the designs of those
who attempt to violate the rules established by the supreme authority, and
deprive children of their rights, the donations which have been made must be
diminished to the extent of the fourth due under the Falcidian Law, as in the
case of an inofficious will.
(1) Where a wife received something from her husband by way of donation at the
time of her marriage, and afterwards gave it to her emancipated son with the
consent of her husband, it is only reasonable to hold that she donated it as
part of the property of his father, because it could not be taken from it
otherwise, as this is forbidden by the marriage; and if the same intention and
result should be ascertained to exist in the disposition of any of his
property, the same rule which We have promulgated with reference to the estate
of the mother shall be observed.
Given on the third of the Idesof September, during the Consulate of the Caesars,
294.
9. The Emperor Constantius, and the Caesar Julian, to Olybrius.
There should be no doubt that the complaint introduced by law with reference to
excessive donations has been derived from the action to declare wills
inofficious, so that, in both these instances, there might be an identical or
similar cause, and the same intervals and method of procedure.
Given on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Taurus
and Florentius, 361.
TITLE XXX. CONCERNING INOFFICIOUS DOWRIES.
1. The Emperor Constantine to Maximus, Governor of Cilicia.As all the property
of your mother is said to have been exhausted by a dowry, and since it is
proper for laws to agree with one another,
power to bring suit on the ground of the gift of an excessive dowry shall be
granted, and the benefits claimed by the other children, and to which they are
entitled, shall be bestowed upon them.
Given on the fourth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of Tatian and
Cerealus, 358.
TITLE XXXI.
CONCERNING THE DEMAND FOR AN ESTATE.
1. The Emperor Marcus Ælius Antoninus to Augurinus, Proconsul of Africa.
The Decree of the Senate enacted at the suggestion of My Grandfather, the
Divine Hadrian, by which it was provided that whatever had, at any time, been
evicted from the government must be returned, not only applies to fiscal cases,
but also to those of private persons claiming an. estate.
(1) Bona fidepossessors cannot be compelled to refund interest which they have
collected from the day of the sale of the property of an estate made by them
before issue has been joined in a case; nor can they be forced to surrender the
crops which they have gathered after issue has been joined, unless they have
profited pecuniarily thereby. They will, however, be obliged, under all
circumstances, to pay over not only the income of property which has not been
sold, and which they have collected, but also whatever they could have
collected, as well as any interest on the price of property sold which accrued
before issue was joined in the case.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of Clarus
and Cethegus, 147.
2. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to the Soldier Marcellus.
When, after suit had been brought with reference to the estate of Menecrates,
Museus, being aware that this had been done, purchased half of the property of
the estate in dispute from the appointed heir, he himself, as a possessor in
bad faith, as well as his heir, will be compelled to refund the profits. If,
however, it should be clearly proved that the sale took place before the action
was brought, the profits must be refunded from the day on which proceedings
were begun, for an estate is increased by the profits when it is in possession
of a person from whom it can be demanded. A purchaser, who is provided with his
own title to possession, can also be sued for separate articles.
Given on the Kalendsof July, under the Consulate of Severus, Consul for the
second time, and Victorinus, 201.
3. The Same to Epictesis.
The claim made by you for the estate of your maternal aunt does not prevent you
from making a demand for another estate which proceeds from a different
succession. But where the first claim was based upon the inofficiousness of the
will, the fact that the case had been de-
cided will offer no impediment to anyone claiming the same estate under another
title.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof August, during the Consulate of Geta and
Plautian, 201.
4. The Emperor Antoninus to Vitalianus.
In transferring the estate, compensation will be allowed for any expense which
you can prove you have incurred on account of the illness of the deceased, or
for his funeral, and which you have paid in good faith out of your own money.
Given on the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Antoninus, Consul for the
fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
5. The Same to Posthumianus.
If a decree has been issued requiring you to surrender the estate which you
possess in good faith, you can, when delivering it, deduct whatever you can
show that you have paid in good faith to the creditors of said estate, for
whenever creditors have received anything to which they are entitled, it cannot
be recovered from them.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of Antoninus,
Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
6. The Emperor Alexander to Firminus.
If you think that the guardians of your grandsons were not legally appointed,
for the reason that you allege they are under your control, do not delay to
demand from them the estate of your emancipated son, the benefit of which you
say belongs to you; and the judge will determine whether the act of those who
appointed the guardians shall be set aside or not, as it is denied that they
are subject to your authority.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Julian,
Consul for the second time, and Crispinus, 225.
7. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Restituta.
It is known to everyone that a demand for an estate which can be made against
possessors in behalf of an heir will not be barred by a prescription of long
time, as the law requires this to be answered in a mixed personal action. It
is, however, clear that the estate can be recovered only by special actions in
rem,where the right of the plaintiff to proceed has been extinguished by
usucaption or prescription.
Given on the second of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 294.
8. The Same, and the Caesars, to Asterius.
When a demand is made for an estate, it must be ascertained, before everything
else, whether or not the testator was free.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of the Caesars,
300.
9. The Same, and the Caesars, to Demophilia.
If the appointed heirs have rejected the estate of your relative which was left
to them, and you have demanded it, either under the praetorian or the Civil Law,
you can bring suit to recover any property of the estate which is involved in
this case.
Given at Nicomedia, on the third of the Kalendsof December, during the
Consulate of the Caesars, 300.
10. The Same, and the Caesars, to Theodosia.
When a son under paternal control has, for a long time, retained in his hands
an estate which was left to him, for this very reason, as the estate has been
accepted, he is considered to have acquired it for the benefit of his father.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 300.
11. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Æternal, Proconsul of Asia.
It is unjust for the possessor of property to be compelled to disclose his
title to possession to anyone who demands it, except that he should be obliged
to say whether he holds the said property as possessor or as heir.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Arcadius,
Consul for the seventh time, and Honorius, Consul for the third time, 396.
12. The Emperor Justinian to Julian, Praetorian Prefect.
When good ground exists for the claim of an estate, and an exception is filed
which protects the claim, this should not be prejudiced, for the greatness and
authority of the Centumviral Tribunal will not permit a claim to an estate to
be interfered with by the schemes of others.
As many distinctions and controversies on this point arose among the ancients,
in order to put an end to them We decree that when any person presents a claim
for an estate, or expects to do so, or to institute proceedings to recover it,
and someone else appears and thinks that it is necessary to represent the
deceased in an action against either the plaintiff or the defendant, on the
ground of a deposit, a loan, a legacy, a trust, or for any other reason, and he
does this by virtue of the bequest of a legacy or a trust, he must comply with
the following conditions, namely, the appointed heir cannot postpone the
decision of the claim by furnishing security, but either the legacy or the
trust can be demanded, if a bond or security in proportion to the rank of the
parties is given.
Where, however, the heir is not successful, the legatee or the beneficiary of
the trust must repay him the money which he received, with interest at the rate
of three per cent; or he must give up the land with the crops which he has
gathered, or the house with the rent which he has collected; of course, in
either of these cases, after having deducted all necessary and useful expenses,
or if he himself prefers to contest the action and await the result of the
filing of the claim for the estate,
he shall be permitted to do this; so that if restitution should be obtained it
may be made to the legatee or the beneficiary of the trust, together with all
lawful augmentations.
(1) But when an action based on certain contracts of the deceased, or on
account of some property which is in dispute, is brought against the possessor
of the estate, and the said property was either made the subject of a deposit
or a loan, or was given in pledge, or encumbered in any other way, the trial
should not be postponed under the pretext that a claim has been made to the
estate; just as where money having been loaned at interest, suit is brought
against the possessor or the plaintiff, or any other personal action is begun,
judgment should not be deferred, but the case ought immediately to be brought
to a termination. For, after the action for the estate has been disposed of,
and the controversy between the claimant of the estate and the possessor has
been decided, if the latter is defeated, he will not be compelled to surrender
the estate, unless the claimant reimburses him for all the expenses which he
has properly incurred. If, however, the plaintiff should be defeated, the court
will compel the possessor, in like manner, to reimburse him, or if he should be
remiss in this respect, he can under this law be forced to comply by a personal
action based on voluntary agency.
(2) Whenever freedom is demanded by slaves from the possessor of the estate or
the claimant of the same, to which it is alleged they are entitled either under
the terms of a trust, or directly by operation of law, it will only be
necessary to wait for a year after the death of the testator; and if the action
to recover the estate has been terminated within that time, the demand for
freedom shall either take effect, or be extinguished, according to the event of
the trial. But if the said period of a year should elapse without a decision,
then on account of the favor with which freedom is regarded, as well as through
considerations of humanity, the grants of freedom will become effective
directly, or the slaves will obtain it under the terms of the trust; provided,
however, that the will should not prove to be forged, and also under the
condition that if the slaves in question had not had charge of some business or
accounts; for even after they have obtained their freedom, they will be
required to surrender any property belonging to the estate which may have
remained in their hands, and to render their accounts by the right of
patronage, that is to say, where this right is enjoyed by him who, by the laws,
can be assigned to this duty.
(3) In order that no doubt may hereafter arise, it must be observed that a suit
brought to recover an estate must always be included among bona fideactions.
Dated at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of
Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
TITLE XXXII. CONCERNING THE ACTION FOR THE RECOVERY OF PROPERTY.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Caecilia..It has been decided that
anyone who possesses the slave of another in good faith is entitled to the
ownership of what is acquired by the
labor of said slave, or from the use of his property; and therefore, if you
possessed a slave of this kind in good faith, and he purchased any property
with your money during the time he was under your control, you can avail
yourself of your means of defence in accordance with the rules of law.
(1) A slave belonging to another cannot acquire anything for his possessor in
bad faith, for he who holds him will not only be compelled to give up the slave
himself, but also anything that he has obtained by means of his labor, as well
as the offspring of female slaves, and the increase of animals.
Given on the third of the Nonesof May, during the Consulate of Faustinus and
Rufus, 211.
2. The Emperor Antoninus to Aristenetus.
If you can prove that the lower part of the building which is attached to the
soil belongs to you, anything which your neighbor has built upon it will
undoubtedly be your property, for whatever is erected upon your ground will
belong to you by law, as long as it remains in the same condition; but if it
should be demolished, the materials composing it will be restored to their
former ownership, whether the building has been constructed in good or bad
faith; provided it was not erected on land belonging to another with the
intention of presenting it to him.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of
Antoninus, Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
3. The Emperor Alexander to Dominia.
Your mother or your husband cannot, without your consent or knowledge, legally
sell a tract of land which belongs to you, and you can claim it as yours from
the possessor, without even tendering him the price. But if you afterwards
consented to the sale, or lost your ownership of the property in some other
way, you will have no right of action against the. purchaser, but you will not
be prevented from bringing suit against the vendor, for the price, on the
ground of business transacted.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of
Alexander, Consul for the second time, and Marcellus, 227.
4. The Emperor Gordian to Munianus, Soldier of Africa.
You are entitled to an action against the possessors who purchased your land in
good faith from others who held possession of it in bad faith, if you should
recover the ownership of the same before the purchasers have obtained it by
usucaption or prescription, based upon long time.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of Pius
and Pontianus, 299.
5. The Same to Herasianus.
The Governor of the province shall order the house which you allege belongs to
you as part of the estate of your mother, and which is
now illegally occupied by an adverse party, to be restored to you, together
with any rent that the occupant has, or could have collected, as well as the
amount of all damage caused by him.
It has been very properly stated in a rescript that any expenses which may have
been incurred cannot be recovered, as possessors in bad faith, who have
expended money on the property of others, and have not transacted the business
of those to whom it actually belongs, have no right to recover them, unless the
said expenses were necessary; but they are permitted to deduct any useful
outlay, if this can be done without injury to the former condition of the
property.
Given on the second of the Idesof February, during the Consulship of Gordian
and Aviola, 240.
6. The Same to Ustronius.
If you deposited money, and the person with whom you left it used it to
purchase land for himself, which was delivered to him, it is contrary to law
that the said land, or any portion of the same, should be transferred to you by
way of compensation for the money expended, when this is done against the
consent of him who obtained it.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof July, during the Consulship of Gordian and
Aviola, 240.
7. The Emperor Philip, and the Caesar Philip, to Antony.
It has been established by law that the offspring of a female slave follows the
condition of its mother, and in a case of this kind the condition of the father
should not be taken into consideration.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of
Philip and Titian, 246.
8. The Same, and the Caesars, to the Soldier Philip.
If (as you allege), your adversary has purchased certain property in his own
name, with your money, the Governor of the province will not, in the name of
justice, refuse you the right to which you are entitled as a soldier. He may,
likewise, grant you an action of mandate, or one of voluntary agency, if you
desire to bring it.
Given on the second of the Nonesof March, during the Consulate of Praesens and
Albinus, 247.
9. The Emperors Carus, Carinus, and Numerian to Antony.
Notify the Governor that the female slave, with reference to whom you have
filed your petition, forms part of the dotal property, and this having been
shown, there will be no doubt that she cannot be recovered by your wife.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Carus and
Carinus, 283.
10. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Jamiarius.
As you assert that you have no documents establishing your ownership over
slaves born in your house, you should file your claim before
the tribunal where proceedings have been instituted to recover what you have
stated in your petition, since the judge will know that the ownership of the
slaves must be established either by the production of documents, as well as by
other evidence, or by the interrogation of the slaves themselves.
Given on the Idesof February, during the Consulate of the abovementioned
Emperors, the first, Consul for the fourth time, and the second, Consul for the
third time, 290.
11. The Same, and the Caesars, to Gallanus.
When anyone knowingly sows or plants land owned by another, it is in accordance
with reason that as soon as whatever is sowed or planted takes root, it will
belong to the soil. For, by an act of this kind, the crop will rather belong to
the owner than the soil to the other party. Where, however, he who did this is
a possessor in good faith, it is well established by legal authority that he
can, by means of an exception on the ground of bad faith, recover his expenses
from him who claims the ownership of the land.
Given on the fourth of the Kalendsof March, during the abovementioned
Consulate, 293.
12. The Same, and the Consuls, to Alexander.
It is unjust and unusual that the slave whom you have delivered, and whose
ownership you have relinquished by so doing, should be restored to you by Our
Rescript, against the consent of the person to whom you delivered him;
therefore, understand that where a female servant has become the property of a
purchaser, any children subsequently born to her follow the ownership of him to
whom their mother belonged at the time of their birth. You can, however, sue
your adversary for the price, if it should not be proved that you have already
received it.
Given on the Idesof April, under the above-mentioned Consulate, 293.
13. The Same, and the Caesars, to Cytichius.
It is an ordinary rule of law that, where suit is brought with reference to
slaves, the question of possession must first be determined, after the slaves
have been produced in court, and that then their ownership shall be established
by the same judge.
Given on the Idesof April, during the above-mentioned Consulate, 293.
14. The Same, and the Caesars, to Septiana.
As you state that you knowingly purchased from your mother a house which
belonged to her son, if the latter should not succeed his mother, but should
claim the ownership of the house, you cannot protect yourself by means of an
exception; because if the son should obtain the estate of his mother who sold
the property, you will not be prevented from availing yourself of an exception
on the ground of
bad faith with reference to the share of the estate which may come into his
hands.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof July, during the above-mentioned Consulate,
293.
15. The Same, and the Caesars, to Aurelius Proculinus.
Where an entire tract of land has been legally sold to two different persons,
it is a plain rule of law that he to whom delivery was first made is entitled
to the preference, so far as the ownership of the property is concerned. If,
therefore, you can prove before the Governor of the province that you were the
first to obtain possession, and paid the price, he will not permit you to be
excluded, under the pretext that no instruments had been drawn up.
You will, indeed, have the choice of retaining the land, or of receiving the
purchase-money which you have paid, with interest; but, in the latter instance,
an account of the crops which have been gathered and of the expense incurred
must be rendered. It has been decided that if you both claim the ownership on
the ground of a donation, he to whom possession of the land was first
transferred will have the preference.
Given on the second of the Kalendsof October, during the abovementioned
Consulate, 293.
16. The Same, and the Caesars, to Januarius.
When anyone builds a house upon land owned in common with others, the rule of
law establishes joint-ownership among all of you, and hence, if you should
desire to claim the share of the person who, while in possession, built the
house in good faith, you must make a tender of the expenses, in order to avoid
being barred by an exception on the ground of bad faith.
Given on the Idesof November, during the above-mentioned Consulate, 293.
17. The Same, and the Caesars, to Sabinus and Others.
If you notified the person who intended to purchase your land that it did not
belong to him who wished to sell it, he who bought it against your protest, or,
in any other way, made a contract in bad faith, will commit an illegal act; and
if you apply to the Governor of the province, he will not only order that the
land which you prove belongs to you, but also the crops which the vendor is
shown to have gathered in bad faith, shall be restored to you.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof December, during the abovementioned
Consulate, 293.
18. The Same, and the Caesars, to Clarus.
When your property is in the possession of someone else, any mistake in
ownership growing out of this fact cannot prejudice your rights, unless some
other question may be interposed against you.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof January, during the abovementioned
Consulate, 293.
19. The Same, and the Caesars, to Callistratus.
Absolute proofs which are not rejected by law are not less worthy of confidence
than documentary evidence; for which reason if you have doubts with reference
to the ownership of a house, and the matter has not yet been decided, you will
not be prevented from introducing what testimony you have.
Given on the second of the Kalendsof January, during the abovementioned
Consulate, 293.
20. The Same, and the Caesars, to Quartilla.
You understand that you cannot sue a slave who you say retains your property,
but you must proceed against his master in order to recover it.
Given on the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of the Caesars, 294.
21. The Same, and the Caesars, to Hierocles.
After having demanded your slaves from those who have possession of them, and
having instituted proceedings to establish your ownership of the same, if
afterwards, when your claim has been allowed, your slaves should not be
restored to you, the judgment shall be executed after the formal oath has been
taken.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof October, during the Consulate of the Caesars,
294.
22. The Same, and the Caesars, to Diodota.
There is no doubt that it is customary for all the crops along with the land to
be surrendered by a possessor in bad faith; and that possessors in good faith
must only restore the present crops, but, after issue has been joined,
everything must be delivered up.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 294.
23. The Same, and the Caesars, to Magnifer.
If other persons, without any good reason, should sell your slave, who had been
carried away by force or stolen, you will not be reduced to the necessity of
paying the price given for him when you bring suit to recover the ownership of
the slave.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 294.
24. The Same, and the Caesars, to Julian.
The law forbids possessors to demand ownership, if they did not obtain
possession by a good title; and therefore, if usucaption does not take place,
the claim of ownership can never be asserted. Hence, in a case of this kind,
where the owner returns under the law of postliminium,the direct right to
prosecute the claim to the property remains unimpaired, without his having
recourse to the Actio rescissaria.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 294.
25. The Same, and the Caesars, to Eugnomius.
Where anyone has paid for another the rent of property which is in possession
of the latter, and no sale takes place, he does not, by any means, become the
owner of the same by virtue of the payment.
Given at Nicomedia, on the sixth of the Kalendsof December, during the
Consulate of the Caesars, 294.
26. The Same, and the Consuls, to Heliodorus.
The delays incident to litigation are of no advantage to a possessor for the
acquisition of the property by prescription based upon long-continued
possession, for this is only computed after issue has been joined in the case.
Given on the Idesof December, under the Consulate of the Caesars,
294.
27. The Same, and the Caesars, to Philadelphus.
A purchaser cannot bring suit to recover a slave who has not immediately been
delivered to him.
Given at Nicomedia, on the twelfth of the Kalendsof January, under the
Consulate of the Caesars, 294.
28. The Same, and the Caesars, to Sopater.
He who is in possession of property belonging to another cannot be compelled to
restore it to its owner, even though he may have no good cause to retain it,
unless the alleged owner proves that it is his.
Dated on the eighth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 294.
TITLE XXXIII. CONCERNING USUFRUCT, LODGING, AND THE SERVICE OF SLAVES.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Possidonius.
Where the usufruct of her entire estate was left by the will of a wife to her
husband, although she may have forbidden any bond to be required of you, still,
you cannot accept money in payment from debtors, unless you furnish security in
compliance with the terms of the Decree of the Senate.
Given on the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of Anulinus and Pronto,
200.
2. The Same to Felix.
We note that the usufruct of certain land has been bequeathed to you by the
terms of a will which you have inserted into your petition, but this does not
prevent the owner of the property from encumbering it to his creditor, provided
the right of the usufruct to which you are entitled remains unimpaired.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof May, during the second Consulate of Antoninus
and Geta, 206.
3. The Emperor Antoninus to Antonianus.
If the usufruct of property was bequeathed to you by your father, you will
obtain nothing after his death, as an usufruct which has been left by will, or
is acquired in any other manner, ordinarily reverts to the property at the time
of the death of the person to whom it was bequeathed.
The right of use and enjoyment is not extinguished during the life of the
usufructuary, even though the owner of the property may die.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Antoninus,
Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
4. The Emperor Alexander to Verbicius.
An usufruct having been established, it follows that security which would be
approved by a good citizen must be furnished by the person who enjoys the
benefit of it, that he will cause no injury to the property by making use of
the same; and it does not make any difference whether the usufruct was
established by will or by voluntary contract.
Given on the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Alexander, Consul for the
second time, and Marcellus, 227.
5. The Same to Evocatus and Others.
If your father left the usufruct of certain land to your mother during the time
of your puberty, and the usufruct terminated after you grew up, you can recover
the crops gathered by her after the abovementioned time, for she knew that she
had no reason to take them as they belonged to another.
Given on the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Alexander, Consul for the
second time, and Marcellus, 227.
6. The Same to Stratonica.
It makes a difference where your husband received the sole usufruct by way of
dowry, and where the ownership was given as dowry, and a contract was entered
into that at his death possession would be restored to you, for an usufructuary
cannot pledge the property. He, however, who has received land as dowry, after
it has been appraised, is not, for that reason, prevented from encumbering it,
as, if the marriage should be dissolved, the appraised value must be repaid to
you.
Given on the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Agricola and Clementinus,
231.
7. The Emperor Gordian to the Soldier Ulpian.
It is an established rule of law that the person to whom an usufruct belongs
must, at his own expense, make such repairs as the roofs require. Hence, if
anything more than was necessary has been expended by you, you can prove the
amount of the outlay, and bring an action to recover it.
Given on the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of Arianus and Pappus,
224.
8. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Ethero.
No prescription, or lapse of time, will authorize an usufructuary or his
successors to acquire the ownership of property to the usufruct of which alone
they are entitled.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof July, during the above-mentioned Consulate,
293.
9. The Same, and the Caesars, to Auxanusa.
Where the usufruct of certain lands and slaves was left to your mother, she is
forbidden to alienate the land or manumit the slaves; for, as she has not the
ownership of the slaves whose services were bequeathed to her by will, it is
clear that her act will be void if she should convey the property to anyone, or
manumit the slaves, both of which belong to the heir of the testator.
Given on the Kalendsof December, during the above-mentioned Consulate, 293.
10. The Same, and the Caesars, to Pomponius.
If the owner of the property has leased the usufruct of the same to your wife,
subject to the payment of a certain sum every year; your wife should not be
denied the privilege of use and enjoyment of the property after the death of
the person who leased it to her.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the above-mentioned
Consulate, 293.
11. The Emperor Justinian to Theodore.
The right to occupy a lodging is terminated by death, and he who enjoys it
cannot, by bequeathing the property, exclude the owner from recovering the
same.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof November, after the
fifth Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
12. The Emperor Justinian to Julian, Praetorian Prefect.
With the intention of disposing of the ambiguity of the ancient law, We decree
that when anyone has left an usufruct to his wife, or to any other person, to
be enjoyed for a certain time until his son or someone else shall become of
age, the usufruct shall stand for the time prescribed by the testator, whether
the person with reference to whose age it was established arrives at that age
or not, for the testator did not have the life of the individual, but a certain
specified term in view, unless he to whom the usufruct was bequeathed should
die; for then it would be impossible for the usufruct to be transmitted to his
successors, as it is an undoubted rule of law that an usufruct is absolutely
extinguished by death.
Where, however, the condition was inserted that it would continue to exist
while the son, or anyone else remained insane, or under other
similar circumstances the result of which was uncertain, and the said son or
other party concerning whom the provision was made should recover his senses,
or the condition should be complied with, the usufruct will be terminated. But
if the person referred to should die while still insane, then the usufruct will
continue to exist, as it would be considered to have been bequeathed for the
life of the usufructuary, since it was possible that the testator had in mind
its continuance during the entire time of the life of the usufructuary, rather
than that the insane person should recover his mental faculties, or the
condition be complied with; and it is perfectly equitable that the usufruct
should be extended during the lifetime of the parties alluded to; for, if the
usufructuary should die before the condition had been complied with, or the
insanity ended, it would be extinguished; and therefore it is just for it to be
prolonged during the life of the usufructuary, even if the insane person should
die before him, or the other condition fail to be executed.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof August, during the fifth Consulate of
Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
13. The Same to the Same Julian, Praetorian Prefect.
As a doubt arose in ancient times, when the usufruct of a house was bequeathed,
in the first place (as the instances are similar), whether the right of lodging
referred to the use and usufruct or to neither of them, that is to say, to a
peculiar right and a special privilege, and whether the person to whom the
right of lodging had been bequeathed could afterwards lease the same, or claim
for himself the ownership of the property, We, for the purpose of disposing of
the disputes of litigants, have removed all such doubts by the following
concise opinion. Where anyone has bequeathed a lodging, it appears to Us to be
the more humane opinion to also grant to the legatee the right to lease it, for
what difference does it make whether the legatee himself remains there, or
gives it up to another for the purpose of receiving compensation? This is much
more apparent if he left the usufruct of the dwelling, as it gives rise to
greater difficulty where the name usufruct is added, for We do not desire that
the lodging should take precedence of the usufruct. The legatee should not
expect to obtain the ownership of the right of residence, unless he can prove
by the clearest evidence that the ownership of the house was also left to him,
for then the will of the testator must in every respect be obeyed.
We decree that this decision shall apply to all places in which a right of
habitation can be established.
Given on the eighteenth of the Kalendsof October, during the fifth Consulate of
Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
14. The Same to the Same Julian, Praetorian Prefect.
Where anyone bequeathed a tract of land, or any other property to another by
will, it was formerly doubted to what extent the usufruct would remain with the
heir, and whether a legacy of this kind would
be valid. Some authorities thought that it would be void, for the reason that
the usufruct could never return to the ownership, but would always remain with
the heir, and they probably held this opinion because the second heir and all
other successors appeared to be the heirs of one person, and therefore an
usufruct of this kind, in accordance with the ancient distinction, could not be
extinguished in the ordinary way. Others, however, thought that a legacy of
this description should not be rejected.
In order to put an end to all such disputes, We decree that such a legacy shall
be valid, and such an usufruct shall be extinguished with the death of the
heir, or shall be terminated if he loses it in any other lawful manner, for
wherefore should an usufruct of this kind enjoy such a privilege that it alone
can be excepted from the general rule which governs the extinction of usufruct?
It is perfectly clear that there is no good reason for this opinion, and
therefore We, by directing that the usufruct shall be terminated and returned
to the ownership, and the legacy be valid, have disposed of all this ambiguity
in very few words.
Given on the thirteenth of the KalendsofOctober, during the fifth Consulate of
Lampadius and Orestes, 530.

15. The Same to the Same Julian, Praetorian Prefect.
A disagreement arose among the jurists of ancient times, when an usufruct was
acquired by a slave for his master, and, on account of the occurrence of
certain events (for many unforeseen changes take place in the affairs of
mortals), part of the said slave comes into the possession of another person,
whether the entire usufruct, which was formerly held by a single individual
through the said slave, continued to belong to him, or whether it was entirely
extinguished, or was divided, and only a portion of it remained under the
control of him who formerly enjoyed it all.
Three opinions were given on this point; one was to the effect that the entire
usufruct was diminished by the alienation of the slave; another, that the
usufruct was only diminished in proportion to the alienation of the slave; the
third, that a share of the slave could be alienated, but that, nevertheless,
the entire usufruct would belong to the person who formerly owned the entire
slave. We find that the eminent legal authority Salvius Julianus adopted this
last opinion.
In order to dispose of this matter, We have decided to accept the opinion of
Salvius Julianus, and of the others who agreed with him, who considered it more
humane that the retention and not the destruction of the usufruct should be
considered, and hold that, even if a part of the slave was alienated, still no
portion of the usufruct will be extinguished; but it will, in accordance with
its nature, remain intact and unimpaired, and that it will be preserved just as
it was in the beginning, without being affected in any way by art occurrence of
this kind.
. Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof October, during the fifth Consulate of
Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
16. The Same to the Same Julian, Praetorian Prefect.
It was decided by the ancients that there were many causes for the extinction
of an usufruct; for instance, the death of the usufructuary, loss of civil
rights, non-user, and many others equally well known. No question, however,
existed with reference to the usufruct itself; but doubts arose concerning the
personal action which originated from it, whether the usufruct was conveyed by
a stipulation, or had been left by will. All the authorities, however, agreed
that it was extinguished by the death of the usufructuary, and by the
forfeiture of civil rights, but they differed as to whether the right of
personal action was extinguished by non-user, if the usufructuary failed to
claim the usufruct for one or two years.
(1) In order to remove these doubts, We hereby decree that not only the action
which arises from the usufruct, but even the right itself shall not be lost by
non-user, but only by the death of the usufructuary or by the destruction of
the property; but that anyone shall continue to hold intact as long as he lives
an usufruct which he may have acquired, unless an exception based on
prescription is pleaded against him, which can be done even if he claims the
ownership, for this will exclude him whether he is present or absent.
Although innumerable accidents occur in the affairs of mortals, on account of
which men cannot continue to hold property which they have, it is doubly hard
to lose, through difficulties of this kind, what one has once had in his
possession.
(2) We, however, do not permit our subjects to suffer injury through every kind
of loss of civil rights, for if you are a son under paternal control, and have
an usufruct which has been acquired from your castrense peculium,and to which
your father has no right, why should you lose by emancipation what you have in
your possession? But, according to what has been stated, it will now only be
lost when the usufructuary dies, or the property is destroyed; and as long as
he has breath, or the substance of the property exists, the usufructuary will
continue to exercise his right, unless barred by the above-mentioned exception,
or where he has suffered such a loss of civil rights as deprives anyone of
freedom or Roman citizenship; for, under such circumstances, the usufruct will
be absolutely extinguished, and will return to the ownership of the property.
Given on the Kalendsof October, at Constantinople, during the fifth Consulate
of Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
17. The Same to John, Praetorian Prefect.
The following question, taken from the books of the Sabinians, has been
referred to Us. A doubt having arisen whether an usufruct acquired by a slave,
or a son under paternal control, will continue to exist after the greater or
intermediate loss of civil rights by the son, or after his death or
emancipation, or after an alienation of the slave or his death or manumission,
We decree that, in cases of this kind, even if the said slave, or son under
paternal control, should be placed
in either of the aforesaid positions, the usufruct which was obtained by the
father or the master through the above-mentioned persons shall not be
extinguished, but shall remain intact.
Nor, even if the father should suffer either the greater or the intermediate
loss of civil rights, or should be removed by death, will the usufruct be lost;
but it will belong to the son, even if he was not appointed an heir by his
father, for the usufruct acquired through him will remain under his control
after his father's death; as it is very probable that the testator, in
bequeathing the usufruct, had the son rather than the father in his mind.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof November, after the
fifth Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 541.
TITLE XXXIV. CONCERNING SERVITUDES AND WATER.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Calpurnia.
If you think that you have any right of action against the person who rebuilt
his house in a different way than it formerly was, and which now interferes
with your lights, you will not be prevented from applying to the court in the
usual manner. The judge will be aware that custom observed for a long time
takes the place of a servitude, provided the party who makes complaint does not
hold possession by violence, or clandestinely, or under a precarious title.
Given on the third of the Idesof November, during the Consulate of Gentianus
and Bassus, 212.
2. The Same to Martial.
If you have conducted water through the premises of Martial, with his
knowledge, for the time prescribed by law for the establishment of a servitude,
you have acquired it. If, however, the use of the land was forbidden to you for
that period of time, you will, in vain, ask that the expenses incurred by you
for that purpose be refunded to you; for any work performed on the land of
another belongs to the owner of the same, as long as it remains in the same
condition.
Given on the Kalendsof July, under the Consulate of Laetus and Cerealis, 216.
3. The Emperor Alexander to Ricana.
The right to conduct water through the field of a neighbor, as well as other
servitudes, can be established in a province, if all the formalities required
for the creation of servitudes have previously been complied with, as
agreements made between contracting parties should be carried out; therefore
you will not be ignorant that where former possessors could not legally prevent
water from being conducted through their premises, the same land charged with
the same servitude will pass to purchasers.
Given on the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Maximus, Consul for the
second time, and Ælianus, 224.
4. The Same to Cornelius.
The Edict of the Praetor does not permit water, whose source is on the ground of
another, to be conducted on the land of someone else, without the consent of
him to whom the use of said water belongs.
Given on the Idesof August, during the Consulate of Maximus, Consul for the
second time, and Ælianus, 224.
5. The Emperor Philip to the Soldier Lucian.
If your opponent has unlawfully constructed anything which interferes with the
servitude owing to your house, the Governor of the province shall take care to
restore everything to its former condition, and cause satisfaction to be made
for the damage produced, in accordance with its seriousness.
Given on the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of Praesens and Albinus,
247.
6. The Emperor Claudius to Priscus.
The Governor of the province will not permit you to be deprived of the use of
water which flows from a spring which you allege belongs to you, contrary to
the rule established by custom; as it would be hard, and almost cruel, for a
water-course which arises on your premises to be unjustly used on those of your
neighbors, when your own land has need of it.
Given on the seventh of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Claudius and
Paternus, 270.
7. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Julian, Praetorian
Prefect.
If it can clearly be shown that the right to make use of water flowing from
certain places on certain lands has been established by ancient custom and
constant use, Our deputy shall provide that no innovation be made contrary to
this ancient rule and long-observed custom.
Given on the fourth of the Nonesof May, during the Consulate of Maximus, Consul
for the second time, and Acquilinus, 286.
8. The Same, and the Caesars, to Anicetus.
If your house does not owe a servitude to the land of your neighbor, the owner
of the latter cannot prevent you from raising your building higher. If Julian
should be convicted of having, either by violence or clandestinely, opened a
window in your wall, he can be compelled to remove the work at his own expense,
and restore the wall to its former condition.
Given on the Kalendsof January, during the above-mentioned Consulate, 293.
9. The Same, and the Caesars, to Zofimus.
If Heraclius has built the wall of his house higher than he should have done
because of a servitude due to you, his neighbor, he can be
compelled by the Governor of the province to remove the new work at his own
expense; but if it is not proved that you are entitled to a servitude, your
neighbor cannot be forbidden to raise his house to a greater
height.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of
the above-mentioned Emperors, 293.
10. The Same, and the Caesars, to Nemphydius.
If the Governor should ascertain that you are entitled to the servitude of
conducting water, and he does not find that you have lost it by nonuser during
the time prescribed by law, he must take measures to enable you to again enjoy
your right. Where, however, it is not proved that this is the case, the owner
of the land cannot be prevented from retaining the water on his own premises,
after having done work for that purpose in such a way that your field will not
be irrigated.
Given on the eleventh of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 294.
11. The Same, and the Caesars, to Aurelian.
A neighbor is not permitted to walk or drive through the land of another who
does not owe him a servitude, but no one can be legally prevented from making
use of the public highway.
Given on the eleventh of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 294.
12. The Same, and the Caesars, to Valeria.
Not the extent of the land, but the nature of the servitude, determined the
course of the water.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 294.
13. The Emperor Justinian to John, Praetorian Prefect.
As an usufruct is extinguished by non-user during the term of two years in the
case of land, and in a year where movable property or that which can move
itself is concerned, We do not allow a right of this kind to be lost in so
short a time, but We grant the terms of ten and twenty years for its
extinction, and We decree that this rule shall apply to other servitudes, so
that all servitudes cannot be lost by nonuser in two years (because they are
always attached to the soil), but that they can be lost in ten years, when the
parties are present, or in twenty when they are absent, in order that the rule
may be the same in all cases of this kind, and all differences be abolished.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof November, after the
fifth Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
14. The Same to John, Praetorian Prefect.
The following point was discussed in the Sabinian Books: A certain man made an
agreement with his neighbor to permit him to pass through his fields, or to
allow his workmen to do so, and agreed that
he should have this right of way for only one day in five years, and be
permitted to go into his woods and cut down trees, or to do anything else that
he might consider to be necessary.
The question was asked when a servitude of this kind would be lost through
failure to use it, and some authorities held that if the grantee did not use
the right of way during the first or second term of five years, the servitude
would be entirely extinguished, as would be the case if it was not used for the
term of two years, counting each period of five years as only one; others,
however, were of a different opinion. It has seemed proper to Us to dispose of
the matter as follows, namely, as We have already decided, in a law previously
enacted, that servitudes shall not be extinguished by non-user during the term
of two years, but during those of ten or twenty years, and, in this instance,
if the grantee himself, or his employees, did not make use of the servitude for
one day during the four terms of five years, they would then lose it through
having neglected to avail themselves of it for twenty years, for he who does
not use his right for so long a period of time will be too late if he desires
its restoration.
(1) As that is a perfectly plain rule of law which forbids a neighbor to erect
a building opposite the threshing floor of another, where, by trampling the dry
grain, its benefit and utility may be secured, but, by the construction of such
a building, the wind will be obstructed, and, in consequence, the straw cannot
be separated from the grain, the wind being prevented by the building aforesaid
from exerting its force everywhere, and, because of its position, the wind will
be of no advantage to the threshing floor, We hereby decree that no one shall
be permitted either to build any house, or do anything else to prevent the wind
from being made use of in a proper and sufficient manner for the above-
mentioned purpose, and thereby render the threshing floor useless to its owner,
and unavailable for the separation of grain.
Given at Constantinople, on the eleventh of the Kalendsof November, after the
fifth Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
TITLE XXXV. CONCERNING THE AQUILIAN LAW.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Glytonis.
If you can prove that you have sustained any damage on account of someone
having burned your forest, or cut down its trees, you can make use of the
action of the Aquilian Law.
Given on the seventh of the Idesof November, during the Consulate of Alexander,
Consul for the second time, and Marcellus, 227.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Mutianus.
Having brought suit under the Aquilian Law against the person who demolished
your house, or burned it, or damaged it in some other way, you can compel the
damage to be made good by applying to a competent judge. Moreover, if you have
been unjustly deprived of the
use of water to which you are entitled, you can, by application to the same
judge, cause your property to be placed in its former condition. Given on the
eighth of the Idesof November, during the Consulate of Gordian and Aviola, 240.
3. The Same to Dolentus.
There is no doubt that you have a right not only to bring suit for damages
under the Aquilian Law, but also to bring a criminal accusation against a
person who has rendered himself liable by having accused you of being
responsible for the death of your female slave.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Gordian,
Consul for the second time, and Pompeianus, 242.
4. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Zoilus.
According to the Aquilian Law, when anyone denies that he has committed
wrongful damage and he is convicted of having done so, he can be compelled to
pay double the amount.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof May, at Heraclea, during the Consulate
of the above-mentioned Emperors, 293.
5. The Same, and the Caesars, to Claudius.
You can bring suit under the Aquilian Law for double the damage which you have
sustained through your cattle having been unjustly shut up and killed, or
allowed to perish by hunger.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors, 293.
6. The Same, and the Caesars, to Plenius.
You are by no means prevented from bringing suit under the Aquilian Law, for
damages which you allege you have sustained on account of cattle having been
permitted to pasture on your land.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof November, under the Consulate of the
Caesars, 294.
TITLE XXXVI. CONCERNING THE ACTION IN PARTITION.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Martian.
If the entire estate of your father has not been divided with the consent of
the heirs, and no decision has been rendered or compromise made with reference
to it, you can bring an action in partition for the division of the estate.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of Lateranus
and Rufinus, 198.
2. The Emperor Antoninus to Vitianus.
If your wife, after the death of your father, to whom she had given her dowry,
and whose heir you have become, should still be united
with you in marriage, you will, in accordance with the provisions of the
ancient law, have the right to bring an action in partition against your co-
heirs for the purpose of obtaining the dowry, and you can retain it even if she
should die afterwards, provided she is still married to you.
Given on the second of the Idesof February ....
3. The Same to Rufus.
Bring suit against your co-heirs for partition, in accordance with the
prescribed legal formalities. If anything should be proved to have been taken
from your share of the estate, the judge appointed to hear the case, having
made proper investigation, shall render judgment in your favor, in accordance
with the rules of law. An action for the crime of plundering the estate will,
in vain, be brought by a co-heir, as he is considered to have been indemnified
by the action in partition.
4. The Emperor Alexander to Amonius.
If, while you were a son under paternal control, and movable property, or that
which can move itself, which might belong to castrense peculium,should be
donated to you by your father, you will be entitled to it as part of your
peculium castrense,which is not owned with your brothers; but the lands,
although they may all have been conveyed to you by your father while you were
in the army, will, nevertheless, not be included in your peculium
castrense.Those lands which are acquired by a son under paternal control on
account of his being in military service come under a different rule, as they
constitute part of the castrense peculium.
5. The Same to Statilia.
It was in your husband's power, in a fit of anger, to change the provisions
which he had made in his will with reference to his slaves, namely, that one of
them should remain in perpetual servitude, and that the other should be sold in
order to be taken away. Hence, if afterwards, his clemency should mitigate his
anger (which, although it may not be proved by documentary evidence, still,
nothing prevents its being established by other testimony, especially when the
subsequent meritorious conduct of the said slave is such that the wrath of the
master has been appeased), the arbitrator in the action in partition should
comply with the last wishes of the deceased.
6. The Emperor Gordian to the Soldier Pomponius.
Property consisting of claims is not capable of division, for, according to the
Twelve Tables, it is by operation of law divided into hereditary shares.
7. The Same to Ælianus.
Where the demand for the execution of a trust arises among coheirs, the Praetor
or the Governor of the province, who has been appointed to decide the case, or
the judge who is to hear the action in
partition, shall exert himself to cause the will of the testatrix to be
observed.
8. The Same to Telesphorus.
You can obtain a division of any property whatsoever which is held in common by
you and your brother, and is derived from the estate of your father or mother,
when the judge decides the action in partition.
9. The Same to Verinus.
There is no doubt that proceedings in partition are included among bona
fideactions, and that your share of the estate (if you are entitled to any),
will be increased by the addition of the profits.
10. The Same to Telesphorus.
When a testator divides his estate among all his heirs, and orders each of them
to be content with certain lands, and the slaves which are attached to the
same, it is clear that his will should be obeyed, if the authority of the
Falcidian Law has not been violated; and when he thinks that all his slaves
should be recommended to his heirs, he does not by the words that follow change
the disposition which he had made of all of them, and his first division does
not become void, as he is considered to have made this statement with reference
to those to whom he had decided to leave the slaves by his will.
11. The Emperor Philip, and the Caesar Philip, to Antony.
It is an established rule of law that the estates of intestate persons should
be equally divided between the sons and daughters of the deceased.
12. The Emperors Gallienus and Valerian to Rufus.
The division made between you and your brother should not (as you allege), be
considered void, because it was not reduced to writing, as the certainty of the
transaction sufficiently establishes the validity of the division.
13. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Saturninus.
It is certain that the peculiaof children should, after the death of their
father, be placed with the remainder of the property of the estate in order to
be divided. Your brother and co-heir, however, who contracted obligations
during the lifetime of your father, who himself was ignorant of the fact,
cannot sue you and your other brother and co-heir, except in order to obtain
the amount from his peculium,for sidered to have made this statement with
reference to those to whom he made the contracts.
14. The Same to Hermianus.
If, in the suit for partition by which the estate of your father was equally
divided between your brother and yourself, nothing was specially agreed in case
of the eviction of the property adjudged to each
of you, that is to say that each one would assume liability for his share, the
Governor of the province shall, by means of the action praescriptis
verbis,compel your brother and co-heir to pay, in proportion to his share, any
damage which you may have sustained through the eviction of the property.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of the
above-named Emperors, 293.
15. The Same to Theophilus.
It has been decided that, when a division has been made by agreement of the
parties, and possession follows by common consent, and the entire ownership of
the property which was decided to belong to your father has been assured to
him, you will have the right to claim said property, if you succeed to his
estate. If, however, the division was based upon an ordinary agreement, the
arbitrator appointed to decide your action in partition shall determine how the
community of interest shall be apportioned among you.
16. The Same to Heraclius.
Children have no power to cause the will of their father to be set aside, if
they cannot prove that it is inofficious, but where some legal formality is
lacking in either the will or the codicil, and the deceased in certain
statements made by him, declared that it was his will, even though succession
on the ground of intestacy may have taken place, it is established by the
authority of the law that, in an action for partition, the judge must comply
with the will of the father, with the exception of the reserve prescribed by
the Decree of the Senate.
17. The Same, and the Caesars, to Commodianus.
It is perfectly certain that, where co-heirs make a division with one another,
the rights of one of them who is absent and is ignorant of the fact will not be
prejudiced, and he can retain the undivided share which belonged to him in the
beginning, to be deducted from all of the shares of the others, wherefore you
can recover your share, with the income, by an action in partition, without
apprehending any loss from the division previously made by the co-heirs.
Given on the seventh of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors, 293.
18. The Same, and the Caesars, to Domina.
It has frequently been stated in rescripts that any property which a father has
purchased in the name of the daughter shall be awarded to her by the arbiter in
a suit for partition, if no contrary intention of the deceased is proved to
have existed. Therefore, if you should become the heir of your father, and the
property which you allege was purchased by him in your name still remains
intact, you can avail yourself of the above-mentioned rescripts against your
sister in proceedings brought before the Governor of the province.
(1) There is no doubt that any expenses incurred by one of the co-heirs in good
faith, on account of an estate owned in common, should
be adjudged to him in an action in partition, or in one based on voluntary
agency.
Given on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof ..., during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors, 293.
19. The Same, and the Caesars, to Lisicratiis.
It is a positive rule of law that, in a case in partition, where any of the
heirs have appropriated any of the common property, or have caused it to
deteriorate, they must be responsible for it, and indemnify the other heirs for
the said property.
Given on the nineteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the above-mentioned
Consulate, 293.
20. The Same, and the Caesars, to Pactuela.
In the action in partition, the price of property owned in common and sold as
such by one of the heirs does not entirely belong to the vendor, but if the
price was paid, his co-heir can bring the action on mandate against him; or if
he ratified the sale, the action on the ground of voluntary agency will lie in
his favor. Where, however, one heir, having sold the property, withholds the
purchase-money, the hereditary shares of the others in the same can be
recovered.
21. The Same, and the Caesars, to Fortunatus.
Where, with the view to the future succession, a father divided his estate
among his heirs, in accordance with his intentions, and, in any way whatsoever
manifested his wishes with reference to the division among his heirs, the
arbitrator appointed for the partition of the estate shall see that the reserve
is made, as is done in the case of the Falcidian Law, and that a division of
any property which the father did not leave to anyone either generally or
specially takes place equally among the heirs and, in rendering his decision,
he shall always comply with the wishes of the father.
22. The Same, and the Caesars, to Dionysius.
When one of several heirs, without the consent of his co-heirs but through
mistake, retains possession of a slave owned in common, the others believing
that the slave belongs to him, he does not make the slave his own, as every
good title to the latter is lacking; but it is clear that each of his co-heirs
has a right to his hereditary share in said slave.
23. The Same, and the Caesars, to Hermogenus.
Although the action to which creditors are entitled against each heir to the
extent of his hereditary share of the estate cannot be changed by an agreement
for division, still, he who is bound by the agreement can be compelled to carry
it out under the terms of the stipulation, and in accordance with law, and
where no stipulation was entered into, he can be sued in an action praescriptis
verbis,if he is not proved to have violated his contract.
24. The Same, and the Caesars, to Socrates.
Atestator, by means of entreaties, implored his son to transfer conditionally
to his brothers and certain other persons a tract of land which he had in his
possession, and which formed a part of the estate; but, after the condition had
been fulfilled, the son retained his hereditary share of the land as his fourth
under the Falcidian Law, setting off against it what he had received from his
co-heirs as a loan. In case anything should be lacking to make up his fourth,
and, after deducting what was paid by the others for the said land any excess
over and above the said fourth should remain, he will be compelled to surrender
it.
Given on the fifth of the Nonesof January, during the abovementioned Consulate,
294.
25. The Same, and the Caesars, to Diodes.
If you should reject the estate of your grandfather, you cannot be forced to
relinquish to your brothers property which you have acquired by a donation, or
in any other way.
Given on the Idesof April, during the Consulate of Tuscus and Anolinus.
26. The Emperor Constantine to Bassus, Praetorian Prefect.
Where a will that has been begun but not completed, or a codicil, a father's
letter, or any other written instrument is found which disposes of property in
any way, or in any terms whatsoever, it should be executed only by the heirs
themselves, no matter to what degree of relationship they may belong, whether
they appear to be of the same degree, or have been emancipated, or are such as
the Praetor calls to the succession; and in the action in partition (although
the children may be called to an intestate succession), with the exception of
the amount reserved by the Decree of the Senate, the dispositions of the
deceased must be observed, even if they were not made in accordance with the
formalities prescribed by law.
When, however, in a will of this kind, the name of a person other than the
children above designated is found, it is certain that the will should be
considered void only with reference to the said person.
Given at Rome, during the second Consulate of Crispus and Constantine-Caesar,
321.
Extract from Novel 18, Chapter VII. Latin Text.
Provided there is attached to an instrument of this kind either the signature
of the father himself, or those of all the children among whom the partition
took place.
TITLE XXXVII.
CONCERNING THE DIVISION OF PROPERTY OWNED IN COMMON. 1. The Emperor Antoninus
to Lucan.
If your brother sold only the share of the land which belonged to him, the sale
cannot be revoked; but you must bring an action for the
division of common property against him who owns the property jointly with you,
and by this means you will obtain the entire tract of land, if you make a
higher offer to your joint-owner for his share than he offers to you for yours.
If, however, he should offer you more, you will take it and transfer your share
to him. When the division of the land can conveniently be made without causing
damage to anyone, you will acquire the part of it which may be adjudged to you.
The following rule, however, should be observed, namely, that, after issue has
once been joined, no one can alienate his share without the consent of all the
other joint-owners of the property.
Given at Rome, on the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Antoninus,
Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
2. The Emperor Alexander to the Soldier Avitus.
If it should be proved before the Governor of the province that your brother
gave in pledge certain vineyards owned by you in common, as he was unable to
encumber to his creditor your share in said vineyards, the Governor shall order
it to be restored to you, together with any crops which the creditor may have
gathered from the same. The Governor must also provide for the division of the
vineyards between you and your brother's creditor, and order him to deliver to
you the portion which he received from your brother, after having been paid the
price which he decides that your brother's share is worth; or he must order it
to be transferred to your brother's creditor after your share has been
appraised, and he has paid to you the amount of its valuation.
Given on the second of the Idesof September, during the Consulate of Alexander,
Consul for the second time, and Marcellus, 227.
3. The Same to Verecundianus.
The duty of the arbiter appointed for the purpose of dividing property between
you and your brother only has reference to such as is held in common by you and
him; for any part of said property which he has sold will be owned in common by
you and the purchaser, and you should ask for an arbiter for each one of them,
if you wish the joint-ownership of said property to be dissolved. When,
however, a tract of land is in such a place that it cannot conveniently be
divided between the joint-owners, then a certain portion shall be adjudged to
each one of them, after a just appraisement has taken place, and a mutual set-
off for the price shall be made between them, so that if one receives a share
of greater value he will be required to indemnify the other. Sometimes, even a
purchaser who is a stranger is allowed to bid on the property, especially where
one of the joint-owners acknowledges that his means are not sufficient to pay
more than the very small sum offered by one of the others.
Given on the fifth of the Nonesof May, during the Consulate of Julian and
Crispinus, 223.
4. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Consuls to Heroda.
If your sister, who is over twenty-five years of age, has divided property
owned in common by yourself and her, it is settled that the division will
stand, even though it is not proved to have been made either by written
documents or other evidence. Where, however, she is a minor, and the time
during which she is entitled to demand complete restitution has not yet
expired, the Governor of the province, after proper investigation, shall
determine whether complete restitution should be made on account of the
division. He shall also provide that division shall be made of any property
held in common by you, and shall require an account of the expenses to be
rendered (if either of you has incurred any with reference to the said
property), as well as an account of the profits, and of any fraud or negligence
which may have taken place (as there is no doubt that all these things should
be considered in an action brought for the division of property owned in
common), in order that equality may be maintained in everything.
Given on the eighth of the Idesof February, during the Consulate of the Caesars,
294.
5. The Same, and the Caesars, to Secundinus.
No one can against his will be compelled to retain his interest in the joint-
ownership of property, or a partnership, therefore, after application has been
made to the Governor of the province, he will provide for the partition of any
property which he may ascertain is held in common by you and your sister.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 294.
TITLE XXXVIII.
MATTERS WHICH APPLY TO BOTH THE ACTION IN PARTITION AND THAT FOR THE DIVISION
OF PROPERTY OWNED IN COMMON.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Marcus.
It has been decided that a division of land has the effect of a sale. Given on
the sixth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of Gentian and
Bassus, 212.
2. The Emperor Alexander to Euphrata.
Even if someone who had no right to do so has appointed an arbitrator to make a
division of property, still, if the partners gave their consent to such a
division, each one of them has obtained the ownership of the property of which
he acquired possession in accordance with the agreement.
Given on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of
Alexander, Consul for the third time, and Dio, 230.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Seva.
It is customary to come to the relief of persons who have attained their
majority, where divisions of property have been made through fraud or deceit,
or unjustly, and not as the result of a decision in court, because in bona
fidecontracts whatever is established to have been done unjustly shall be
corrected.
Given on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of the same
Emperors, 293.
4. The Same, and the Caesars, to Maximian.
If your paternal uncle, while transacting business for himself, purchased a
part of certain property owned in common, and did not thereby become a joint-
owner of all of it, measures must be taken to indemnify you for the share to
which you are entitled; and therefore it is contrary to the rules of law to
demand that he shall divide with you the ownership of what he purchased.
Given on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors; the first, Consul for the fourth time, and the
second, Consul for the third time, 293.
5. The Same, and the Caesars, to Frontinus and Gaferio.
With reference to the documents which you allege are jointly owned by your
brother and yourself, the Governor of the province, having been applied to,
shall determine with whom they should be deposited.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof February, during the abovementioned Consulate.
6. The Same, and the Caesars, to Thesidiana and Others.
If you made a division of property with your paternal uncle, under the
condition that he would swear that he had not been guilty of malicious fraud in
the transaction, and he does not comply with what he agreed to, nothing can
prevent you from claiming an undivided interest in the property which was the
subject of the agreement, and was included in the division.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of the Caesars,
294.
7. The Same, and the Caesars, to Severianus and Flavianus.
If your brothers have encumbered their undivided interest in a tract of land
without your consent, and the land comes into your hands in accordance with the
contract for partition, without any mention having been made of the
encumbrance, and the shares which belonged to the other joint-owners before the
partition was made and to which the lien solely attached, are evicted, you can
bring the action praescriptis verbisagainst your brothers, under the
stipulation, if one was made; otherwise you can sue for the value of your
interest; for if you,
being aware of the lien on the land, accepted the ownership of the same, you
will not have the power to proceed against your brothers, unless you prove that
the guarantee against eviction was made by a formal statement, or promised by
an agreement.
Given at Nicomedia, on the second of the Nonesof December, during the Consulate
of the Caesars, 294.
8. The Same, and the Caesars, to Nicomacus and Others.
If a division of property owned in common, made by you after reaching the age
of twenty-five years, was perfected by the relinquishment or transfer of
possession, and this was done in good faith and by common consent, it cannot be
abrogated.
Given on the Nonesof December, during the Consulate of the Caesars, 294.
9. The Same, and the Caesars, to Demetrianus.
The action in partition, or the one for the division of property owned in
common, can only be brought while joint-ownership of the property exists.
Given at Nicomedia, on the sixth of the Idesof December, during the Consulate
of the Caesars, 294.
10. The Same, and the Caesars, to Gallicanus.
Where all the property to be divided is specifically stated in a written will,
nothing will prevent the heirs from demanding that any which the testator did
not mention be divided.
11. The Emperor Constantine to Caerulus.
The division of land should be made in such a way that slaves or serfs attached
to the soil may pass to each heir without being separated, so that the
relationship or affinity of those most closely connected may remain unimpaired;
for who can suffer children to be separated from their parents, sisters from
their brothers, and wives from their husbands? Therefore, if anyone should,
contrary to law, separate either slaves or serfs connected in this manner, he
shall be compelled to again unite them.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Proculus and
Paulinus, 334.
12. The Emperor Justinian to the Senate.
The following provisions have appeared to Us to be in perfect conformity to
justice. If anyone, having either signed or given an antenuptial donation in
behalf of his son, or a dowry in behalf of his daughter, provided that what he
gave may revert to him, either under the terms of a stipulation, or by the law,
or if someone else, having given a dowry or an ante-nuptial donation, in such a
way that the tenor of the stipulation or the force of the law will cause it to
come into the hands of the father, and he, having made a will, appoints either
his children or strangers his heirs, and makes no disposition whatever of the
property which has reverted to him, or come into his hands in this
manner, and other children of his are found who have obtained a part of their
father's property during his lifetime, either as an ante-nuptial donation or as
a dowry, or on account of service in the army, which (as long as a will
stands), they cannot be compelled to place in the mass of the estate, then the
son or daughter aforesaid shall have as his or her separate property whatever
reverted to their father or came into his hands, which shall be computed as any
other profit; so that, in the present instance, he or she will only be entitled
to as much as his or her brothers obtained from their father by the means which
We mentioned above, and they will not be compelled on account of the will to
place it in the general mass of the estate.
But where nothing was given by their father to any of their brothers, they
cannot claim this share for themselves, but it becomes, as it were, a part of
the paternal estate to be divided among all the heirs, in accordance with the
terms of the will, and this only applies where the distribution of the estate
of the father was made among the children. If, however, foreign heirs were
appointed, and nothing was stated by the testator in his will with reference to
this portion of his estate, then the son or the daughter will undoubtedly be
entitled to whatever reverted or came into their father's hands as a preferred
legacy. When what was given to the brothers was less than what came into the
father's hands in this way, an equal amount shall be reserved, and the balance
having become a part of the paternal inheritance, shall be divided in
accordance with the usual method of distributing estates.
It should undoubtedly be observed that, if the amount which the father received
from this source is less than that which he gave to his children, the whole of
it will belong to those on whose account the property reverts to the father.
Therefore, We desire that those rules which We have declared apply to the
father shall also be applicable to the grandfather, and the paternal or
maternal great-grandfather, as well as to the mother, the grandmother, and the
paternal or maternal great-grandmother.
Given at Constantinople, on the eleventh of the Kalendsof August, during the
fifth Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 550.
TITLE XXXIX. CONCERNING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF BOUNDARIES.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Nicephorus.
The owner of a tract of land cannot be prevented from selling a certain portion
of it after having removed the boundaries and retain- . ing the remainder. The
purchaser cannot claim a greater amount of land than that which came into his
hands in accordance with a contract of sale, under the pretext of certain
boundaries existing during the time preceding the sale.
Given at Nicomedia, on the Idesof December, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors, 293.
2. The Same, and the Caesars, to Tatian.
The difference of succession, and the consent of neighbors can, by either
adding to or taking from lands, frequently change the position of ancient
boundaries.
Given at Nicomedia, on the ninth of the Kalendsof January, under the Consulate
of the above-mentioned Emperors, 293.
3. The Emperor Constantine to Tertullian.
Where anyone first raises a question concerning the boundaries of his property,
and it has reference to the contest of the ownership of the same, the question
of possession must first be disposed of, and then the surveyor will be directed
to go to the place, so that the truth having been ascertained, the controversy
relating to the boundaries may be terminated. If, however, the other party
should absent himself, in order that this question may not be decided, the
surveyor shall, nevertheless, proceed to go to the place designated by the
Governor of the province, and take his measurements in the presence of the
adverse party.
Given at Verona, on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate
of Gallicanus and Symmachus, 230.
4. The Same to Bassus, Urban Prefect.
If it should be established that someone who raised a question as to a boundary
intended to seize the property of another before a decision had been rendered
in the case, he shall lose not only what he wrongfully claimed, but (that
everyone should be content with his own property and not desire that of
another), if he who is the aggressor, when demanding the land, should be
defeated in court, he shall lose as much land as he attempted to take from the
other party.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of
Gallicanus and Symmachus, 330.
5. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Neoterius, Praetorian
Prefect.
The exception of five feet having been abolished, persons shall be free to
bring actions for the determination of the boundaries, or the ownership of
property of these dimensions.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Arcadius,
Consul for the second time, and Rufinus, 392.
6. The Emperors Theodosius, Arcadius, and Honorius, to Rufinus, Praetorian
Prefect.
For the purpose of finally disposing of all fraudulent schemes and
machinations, We decree that so far as the determination of boundaries is
concerned, not the prescription of long time, but only that of thirty years
shall be applicable.
Given on the second of the Nonesof November, during the Consulate of Arcadius,
Consul for the second time, and Rufinus, 392.
TITLE XL. CONCERNING PERSONS INTERESTED IN THE SAME CASE.
1. The Emperor Julian to Secundus, Praetorian Prefect.
All those exceptions having been abolished and rejected to which litigants were
accustomed to have recourse, under the pretext that other parties were
interested, in order to protract the decision of the case, permission is hereby
granted to any of them (whether all are under the same jurisdiction or reside
in different provinces), to bring the action or file the answer, without
requiring the presence of one or more of the others, who may be interested in
the suit.
Given on the third of the Nonesof September, during the Consulate of Mamertinus
and Nevita, 362.
2. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Sallust, Praetorian Prefect.
After an action has been properly begun, a matter in which several persons are
interested can proceed without a mandate, even where several of the parties are
absent, if those present are prepared to furnish security that they who are
absent will ratify what is done; or (if suit should be brought against them),
that they will furnish security that the judgment will be paid.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof December, during the Consulate of the Divine
Jovinian and Veronian, 364.
TITLE XLI. CONCERNING NOXAL ACTIONS.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Marcellus.
If the sum of money which you allege was stolen from the estate of your father
by a person who has proved to have been free, you will not be prevented from
bringing suit to recover it, or one to compel its production in court; for
while, in other instances, the damage follows the person, and a slave who has
been manumitted is liable in an action of theft, which does not lie in favor of
an heir, still, when a slave steals anything from his master, although he
commits a theft, the action of theft does not arise, nor can it be brought
against him, even after he has been manumitted, unless he continues to retain
possession of the stolen property after his liberation.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of
Maximus, Consul for the second time, and .Ælianus, 224.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Quintilian and Others.
If your slaves, without your knowledge, or even against your express
prohibition, have secretly cut down trees, penalty for which is prescribed by
the law enacted with reference to forests, you need not apprehend that you will
be compelled to surrender the slaves, in addi-
tion to being liable for the damage sustained, for where masters are ignorant
of the crimes of their slaves, or have forbidden them to perform certain acts,
if they should be sued in a noxal action, judgment shall be rendered against
them to either surrender the slaves by way of compensation, or to retain them
under their control, after having satisfied the judgment for damages.
Given on the third of the Nonesof June, during the Consulate of Gordian and
Aviola, 240.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Eutychius.
If you are prepared to formally accuse a slave of kidnapping, you will not be
prevented from appearing before the Governor of the province; or, if you should
prefer to bring the noxal action, or that of theft against the master of the
said slave, the Governor of the province will take cognizance of your case; but
you are aware that if you should elect to sue the master, and cannot prove that
the crime was committed with his consent, which you attempted to do, he will
have the choice either of surrendering the slave by way of reparation to
indemnify you for the damage, or of paying the penalty.
Given on the fifth of the Nonesof October, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors, 295.
4. The Same, and the Caesars, to Sosius.
If a slave, without the knowledge of his master, or even if he is aware of it
but is unable to prevent it, takes away your property with violence, you can
bring suit for quadruple damages against his master before the Governor, if the
available year has not yet elapsed; and if it has elapsed, you can bring the
simple noxal action against him. When he prefers to surrender the slave by way
of reparation, you will still not be prevented from suing him for the amount
which came into his hands from the robbery; for if the act was committed with
his knowledge and he could have prevented it, he should, by all means, be
compelled to pay the amount of the judgment, without taking into consideration
the surrender of the slave. Where, however, you intend to bring an accusation
for public crime, on account of your wife having been carried away by a slave,
you should bring it not against the master, but against the slave who you
allege perpetrated the offence.
Given on the eighteenth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors, 299.
5. The Same, and the Caesars, to Menophilus.
Ifa slave, with the aid and advice of his master, has taken from you, by non-
manifest theft, a female slave and other property, as a civil action cannot
exist between a slave and a freeman, you can proceed against the master in a
penal action for double damages on account of this crime; and so far as the
other property is concerned, you can bring a real action to recover it or a
personal action for its value.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof April, during the above-mentioned
Consulate, 294.
TITLE XLII.
CONCERNING THE ACTION TO COMPEL THE PRODUCTION OP PROPERTY IN COURT.
1. The Emperor Alexander to the Soldier Crescens.
If the ownership of the female slave, with reference to whom you have brought
an action, belongs to your mother, she could not lawfully have been sold by
your father; and if you claim her for yourself, the Governor of the province
shall order her to be produced in order that the truth of the matter may be
judicially ascertained.
Given on the Kalendsof May, under the Consulate of Alexander,
227.
2. The Same to Cyrus.
Where a demand is made for a slave accused of some crime, the master should, by
means of the action for that purpose, be compelled to produce him in court.
Given on the eleventh of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of
Alexander, 227.
3. The Same to Felicissima.
If you have now the right to bring suit for the production of property, or the
one for its recovery, this cannot be contested on the ground that it has been
extinguished, because, some time previously, judgment was rendered against you
in an action for the production of property, since the present case is
different on account of the proceedings having been changed.
Given on the Kalendsof December, under the Consulate of Maximus, Consul for the
second time, and Ælianus, 234.
4. The Same to Flacilla.
If you can prove that documents belonging to you are in the hands of the
adverse party, and the latter does not produce them, the judge will be aware
that you should be granted power to tender him the oath
in court.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate
of Agricola and Clementinus, 231.
5. The Emperor Gordian to the Soldier Sabinianus.
The opinion was very properly given by the jurist Modestinus, whose authority
should not be despised by you, that not only the party in possession is liable
to the action for the production of property in court, but also he who has been
guilty of fraud to avoid producing it.
Given on the second of the Idesof February, during the Consulate of Gordian and
Aviola, 240.
6. The Emperor Philip to Palemonides.
If, after a formal accusation has been made by you to the effect that the
adverse party has seized documents necessary to establish
your rights, and you bring a criminal action against him, you must prove the
truth of your allegations. When, however, you bring suit for the production of
the property in court, you will be obliged to proceed in the way which is
customary in such cases.
Given on the second of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Peregrinus and
Æmilianus, 245.
7. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars to Vitalianus.
Where anyone who is required to produce property in court has the power to do
so, but commits negligence or fraud in obeying the order, and then produces it
in a damaged condition, the equity of the proceeding demands that although an
action to compel the production cannot be brought, still, one in factumcan be
granted against him.
Given on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and Acquilinus, 287.
8. The Same, and the Caesars, to Photinus.
If the person whom you mentioned in your petition has loaned or deposited your
property, you can bring either the action for its production, or the one for
its recovery against whomever has possession of the same. But if an agreement
was made that the property should be restored to you, and you have succeeded
him who deposited it, you cannot, on the ground of hereditary right, be
prevented from availing yourself of the action of deposit.
If, however, you have not title to the estate under either the civil or
praetorian law, understand that, strictly speaking, you have legally no right of
action based on the contract executed by him against whom you ask for relief,
but an equitable action of deposit will be granted you, in accordance with
justice.
Given at Heraclea, on the fifth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of
the above-mentioned Emperors, 293.
9. The Same, and the Caesars, to Faustinus.
If you prove that you have paid a legal debt to the person to whom it was due
under some contract, in the presence of the Governor of the province, he will
order your notes, under which nothing more can be claimed, and the instruments
evidencing the contract, to be produced and returned to you, as you have
naturally been released from liability.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors, 294.
TITLE XLIII.
CONCERNING GAMBLERS AND GAMES OP CHANCE. 1. The Emperor Justinian to John,
Praetorian Prefect.
The practice of games of chance is very ancient, and has been permitted to
soldiers when they were not otherwise occupied, but,
having been adopted by innumerable foreign nations, it has been the cause of
many tears, for persons who were not professional gamblers and did not
understand the game, playing day and night, lost all their property by staking
their money, their ornaments, their precious stones, and their gold. As the
result of this they are ordinarily led to blaspheme the name of God and curse
Him, and execute instruments.
Therefore, having in view the welfare of Our subjects, We decree by this
general law that no one shall be permitted to gamble either in public or
private houses, or other places, or to watch those who do; and if this law
should be violated no prosecution shall follow, but any amount which has been
paid shall be returned, and can be recovered by proper actions, either by the
person who paid it, or by their heirs  even if they have neglected to demand
it  or by their attorney or their parents; or, if they should fail to do so,
the Treasury can recover it by its representatives, notwithstanding the
prescription, unless it has run for fifty years.
The bishops of the different dioceses shall see that this law is executed, and
shall have the right to avail themselves of the aid of the Governors of
provinces, and they shall regulate the following five games, namely: comon-
belon, comon-diaulomolon, rhindalca, kayron,and ecperusan.We do not, however,
permit the stakes in these games to exceed one solidus,no matter how wealthy
the persons may be, and if anyone should happen to be beaten, he will not
sustain a serious loss, for We not only legally regulate wars, but also matters
connected with amusement.
We do not prescribe a penalty for those who violate this law, still, We grant
authority to bishops to make an investigation, and demand the aid of Governors
to enforce it; and We absolutely forbid the game called "wooden horses" to be
played, and if anyone should lose while engaged in it, he can recover what he
has lost, and the houses in which persons are found to be gambling in this
manner shall be confiscated. When the person who paid the money is unwilling to
have it refunded, Our Procurator shall claim it, and employ it for public
purposes. Judges shall likewise see that all persons abstain from blasphemy and
perjury (which, indeed, should be prevented by their authority).
TITLE XLIV.
CONCERNING RELIGIOUS PLACES, AND THE EXPENSES OF
FUNERALS.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Dorita.
If the remains of your son should be threatened by the waters of a river, or
any other just and necessary cause should arise, you can transfer them to
another place, with the consent of the Governor of the province.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of
Antoninus, Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
2. The Same to Hilarianus.
When a dead body has been brought on land belonging to you, either against your
consent or without your knowledge, or a stone is placed there, this does not
make the place religious. If, however, anyone should bring a corpse upon your
land with your consent, the place will thereby become religious, as there is no
doubt that a monument cannot be erected, nor any place be rendered religious,
if the owner forbids this to be done.
Given on the Kalendsof May, under the Consulate of Acquilinus, Consul for the
second time, and Anulinus, 217.
3. The Emperor Alexander to Rimus.
The Governor of the province shall order that the legacy left you by the
deceased shall be paid, as well as what you can prove that you have expended
for the funeral, or for the deceased while he was ill, in accordance with the
judgment of a good citizen.
Given on the fifth of the Nonesof July, during the Consulate of Maximus, Consul
for the second time, and Ælianus, 224.
4. The Same to Lucian.
If by the term "monument" you mean a sepulchre, you are informed that no one
can claim it by the right of ownership; but where it belongs to the family the
title to it will be vested in all the heirs, and in a partition it cannot be
allotted to any individual one. Profane places, however, which are near it, and
have always been connected with buildings intended for the use of men, will
belong to the person to whom the structures to which they appear to have been
attached are granted by the partition.
Given on the sixth of the Nonesof November, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and Ælianus, 224.
5. The Same to the Soldier Cassius.
A father and a mother who are the heirs of their son, who was a soldier, should
not fail to comply with his will, in which he provided for the erection of a
monument to himself, for although all complaints on this ground have been
abolished by former constitutions, still, the parents cannot avoid experiencing
regret, and being conscious that they have neglected their duty by failing to
comply with the last will of the deceased.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Julian and
Crispinus, 225.
6. The Same to Primitivus and Others.
The inscriptions on monuments do not transfer to freedmen either the right of
sepulture, or the ownership of a place which is not religious; but you can take
advantage of prescription for a long time, if there was good ground for it in
the beginning.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Julian and
Crispinus, 225.
7. The Emperor Gordian to Claudius.
You are not forbidden to place statues upon a tomb, or to decorate with
ornaments a sepulchre which you allege that you have built, for everyone is
perfectly free to avail himself of his right, provided that he does not do
anything prohibited by law.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Gordian,
Consul for the second time, and Pompeianus, 242.
8. The Emperor Philip to Julia.
The right of sepulture in a family tomb does not extend to persons connected by
affinity, or to mere blood-relatives who have not been appointed heirs.
Given on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of
Peregrinus and Æmilianus, 245.
9. The Same, and the Caesar Philip, to Faustina.
It is evident that a religious place should not be sold; but it is none the
less certain that a field which is not religious, and adjoins a monument, is
subject to the law as profane property, and hence can legally be alienated.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of Philip
and Titian, 246.
10. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Aquilina.
If the body was not permanently committed to the tomb, you will not be
prevented from removing it.
Given on the eighth of the Idesof February, during the Consulate of Diocletian,
Consul for the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third time, 290.
11. The Same, and the Caesars, to Gaudentius.
We do not forbid criminals to be buried who have suffered the punishment that
they deserved.
Given on the eighth of the Idesof April, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors; the first, Consul for the fourth time, and the second,
Consul for the third time, 290.
12. The Same, and the Caesars, to Victorinus.
It was long since forbidden that the remains of deceased persons should be
buried inside a city, lest the sacred right of citizens might be defiled.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors; the first, Consul for the fourth time, and the second,
Consul for the third time, 290.
13. The Same, and the Caesars, to Dionysius.
.The family, as well as the hereditary right of sepulture, extends also to
foreign heirs. The family right, however, is vested in its mem-
bers, even if none of them is an heir, but it is enjoyed by no one else who is
not an heir.
Given on the third of the Idesof November, during the Consulate of the Caesars,
294.
14. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Cynegius, Praetorian
Prefect,
No one can transfer a human corpse from one place to another without permission
of the Emperor.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Kalendsof March, during the
Consulate of the Noble Youth Honorius and Evodius, 386.

THE CODE OF OUR LORD THE EMPEROR JUSTINIAN.
SECOND EDITION.
(Continued.)
BOOK IV.
TITLE I. CONCERNING PROPERTY LOANED AND THE OATH.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Herculianus.
A case which has been decided by the tender of an oath by either the adversary
or the judge, with the consent of the parties, or if the oath has been
remitted, cannot be revived under the pretext of perjury, unless a special
exception is made by this law.
2. The Emperor Alexander to Felix.
The contempt of the obligation of an oath has a sufficient avenger in God. It
has been decided that, where anyone has sworn by the Emperor, and has perjured
himself in the moment of excitement, he will not be liable to any corporeal
penalty, or for the crime of treason, according to the Constitutions of My
Divine ancestors.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof April, under the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and Julianus, 224.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Sever a.
In bona fidecontracts, as well as in other cases, the decision must be made by
the judge after proper investigation, by means of an oath in default of
evidence.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and Aquilinus, 226.
4. The Same, and the Consuls, to Maxima.
Even if a ward has tendered an oath to his guardian for the purpose of avoiding
the action on guardianship, he is not forbidden to subsequently bring the same
action.
Given during the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of the same Emperors; the
first, Consul for the fourth time, and the second, Consul for the third time,
290.
6. The Same, and the Csesars, to Bessius.
As you allege that the parties agreed that the question of descent and free
birth should be decided by an oath, the Governor of the province, in accordance
with the decree of the arbitrator, with reference to your agreement, shall
decide in favor of the children of your maternal aunt.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof February, during the Consulate of Tiberian and
Dio, 291.
7. The Same, and the Czesars, to Eutychianus.
Neither a son, nor anyone else, can, against the consent of the owner of the
property, cause her any prejudice either by bringing suit, entering into an
agreement, or tendering an oath. Wherefore, if your son has transacted any
business with reference to your property, and you have not ratified what he has
done, this will be of no disadvantage to you.
Given on the Idesof November, during the Consulate of the abovementioned
Emperors, 293.
8. The Same, and the Ctesars, to Alexander.
Whether the oath has been tendered to or by the plaintiff, or has been
remitted, an action in factumwill lie in his favor; as is the case with one for
the execution of a judgment.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of the Caasars,
294.
9. The Same, and the Csesars, to Martian.
If the plaintiff has tendered the oath, and there is no evidence that he has
done this for the purpose of annoyance, the defendant will be required by the
court either to make payment, to be sworn, or to have recourse to the oath of
the plaintiff.
Given on the fifth of the Kalends ofMay, during the above-mentioned Consulate,
299.
10. The Same, and the Csesars, to Protogenes.
In an action of deposit which has been brought with reference to property
delivered without any written instrument, the oath can be tendered just as in
other bona fideproceedings.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the
Csesars, 300.
11. The Emperor Justinian to Demosthenes, Prsetorian Prefect.
If anyone should tender the oath, and, before it was taken, should recall it
(as, for instance, where he has obtained other evidence), We order that he
shall not, under any circumstances, be permitted to have recourse to it a
second time; for it is perfectly absurd for him to do so, .when he thought that
he could reject it, and then again have recourse to it when he found that his
other evidence was worthless; and the judges shall not hear persons who attempt
to commit such injustice.
If, however, anyone should tender the oath, and then wish to revoke it, he
should be permitted to do so, and to produce other evidence if he so desires;
provided, however, that this permission shall only be granted him until the
case is decided. After final judgment has been rendered, from which no appeal
has been taken, or where it has been confirmed after an appeal, We do not
permit the oath to be recalled, and evidence to be introduced by anyone, lest
the case having been begun again, after its termination another action may
arise.
Given at Chalcedon, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof October, during the
Consulate of Decius, 529.
12. The Same to Demosthenes, Prsetorian Prefect.
Generally speaking, everything relating to oaths tendered in litigation either
by the judge or by the parties must be definitely settled; for it has already
frequently happened that judges impose the oath by rendering a decision, and,
as an appeal was not taken, because those who were ordered to be sworn died
before this could be done, the evidence in the case was lost; for there is a
great deal of difference between the oath of an heir and that of the person
from whom he derived his right. Hence, compelled by necessity, and desiring to
bring all possible aid to the production of evidence, We issue the following
decree. Every oath tendered by either the judges or the parties, in the
beginning of the suit, while it is being tried, or at the time when judgment is
rendered, shall be taken in the presence of the same judge, without waiting for
his final decision, or without apprehension of an appeal.
(1) Where the oath has been tendered by the parties, and approved by the judge,
or has been tendered to either party by the judge himself, and he to whom it
was tendered for some reason or other hesitates, or whether the party who
tenders it does so, he to whom it is tendered shall be compelled to take it.
If, however, he should refuse, the oath shall be considered as having been
taken, and the case shall be decided without leaving any ground for appeal. For
who will tolerate that anyone should have the benefit of an appeal from a
decision which he himself was instrumental in having rendered?
(2) If, however, he to whom the oath was tendered either by his adversary, or
by the judge, absolutely declines to take it, he shall have the right to
refuse. But the judge, if he thinks that the oath ought, by all means, to be
taken, can decide the case just as if the party who refused to be sworn had
desired that he should do so; and he can examine the other points of the case
or all of it, and it shall take its course without being interrupted by any
obstacle. He, however, who was not willing to take the oath which was tendered
him,-whether he states his reasons for this, or whether he is not heard, shall
be entitled to the benefit of an appeal; and if the judge who presides when the
appeal was argued should decide that the oath was properly tendered, and was
not lawfully refused, the case shall remain unaltered. If, however, he should
hold that the oath was not legally tendered, but was properly refused, he will
then be permitted
to correct the opinion of the judge which was based, as it were, upon the oath
being declined; and the party will in no way be prejudiced, or incur any unjust
expense, and the course of the case from beginning to end shall not be
interfered with, and shall be impartially weighed in the scales of justice.
(3) Whether the oath has been tendered or refused, the party who tendered it
shall not be allowed the benefit of an appeal; as it would be too unjust that
he who tendered the oath should be entitled to appeal merely for the reason
that the judge granted his request.
(4) We prescribe these rules in this law for persons who are present, but those
who are absent should not be neglected; hence, if the party to whom the oath
was tendered is not present, the case should be conducted by an attorney, and
it is necessary that the principal party should be granted a certain time to
appear in court, in order that he may carry out what has been decided with
reference to the oath; or if the judge should think it best, this can be done
in the province where the aforesaid party lives, under the evidence of the
plaintiff that the oath has either been tendered by him, or to him, or has been
refused, so that the case may be definitely decided, no matter what course has
been pursued.
Permission should also be given to the adverse party, either in his own proper
person, or by his attorney, to be present when the formalities to be observed
by the litigant to be sworn are complied with; or if he should prefer to do
neither, and, on the other hand, it is established by documentary evidence that
the oath was taken, tendered, or refused, it is the duty of the judge to
determine by whom the expenses of a proceeding of this kind should be paid,
whether by both parties or only by one of them. No obstacle should arise for
the decision of cases in a proceeding of this kind, but the other points or
questions of the case must be examined by the judge, and after the documents
concerning the oath have been placed in his hands, he must return to this
subject, and, having disposed of it, pass to other matters. All other
regulations, which have herein been established with regard to parties who are
present, must also be observed in the case of those who are absent.
(5) We decree that in every instance in which the oath is taken, the judicial
rules having reference to the rank of a person must be obeyed, and the oath
shall be taken either before the judge himself, or in the house of the party
who is sworn, or upon the Holy Scriptures, or in the Churches.
(6) In like manner, We direct that the rules relating to the oath of calumny,
or of the re-tender of the oath which have been provided by the laws introduced
either by Ourselves or Our predecessors, shall remain in full force; for these
have been promulgated, not with view to abrogating the ancient laws in any way,
but that whatever may seem to be lacking to them may be supplied.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of Decius.
13. The Same to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
Where anyone demands a legacy or a trust as having been left to him, and this
does not appear by the will, the oath should be tendered to him by the heir,
and he should swear that the legacy or trust has been bequeathed to him; and if
he should obtain what he demanded under the will, and it should afterwards
become clear that nothing was left him, the question was raised by the ancient
authorities whether what was established by the oath should stand, or whether
the party should restore what he had received; or whether if, in fact, the
legacy or the trust had been left to him, We should give the heir permission to
deduct the Falcidian portion, where there was ground for doing so.
The better opinion seems to Us to be that, in the first place, the legacy or
the trust ought to be recovered from him, and that he should obtain no benefit
from this act of perjury. Ifr however, what he swore to was found to be true,
the Falcidian fourth could be reserved if there was good reason for it, in
order that no one might by Our laws be afforded an opportunity to obtain an
infamous profit as the result of his own crime.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof November, after the
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 532.
TITLE II.
WHERE A CERTAIN THING is DEMANDED.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Modestinus.
You do not ask what is just or customary when you request that you and your
brother, who is your co-heir, shall be permitted to pay the debts of your
father, not in proportion to your shares of the estate, but in accordance with
the appraisement of the property left as preferred legacies; for it is a well-
settled rule of law that the charges of an estate must be borne by the
testamentary heirs in proportion to their hereditary shares, and not with
reference to the benefit received. You, yourself, do not appear to be ignorant
of this, as. you have paid the creditors in proportion to your share of the
estate in accordance with the rule of ancient law.
Given on the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Chilo and Libo, 205.
2. The Emperor Antoninus to Hermogenes.
Although Asclepiades lent your money in his own name, having stipulated,
however, that it should be paid to himself, you can by an action of mandate
compel him to assign to you the right of action to enable you to recover it.
Given on the seventh of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Messala and
Sabinus, 215.
3. The Emperor Gordian to Sempronius.
It has frequently been stated in rescripts that those who hold office in
provinces cannot either themselves, or through persons substituted by them,
lend money at interest during their terms of office.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of Gordian
and Aviola, 240.
4. The Emperor Philip and the Caesar Philip, to Maximus.
If you have lent the money of anyone who is absent at interest, in his own
name, and he disapproves of the transaction, you can bring the action of
mandate, and the Governor of the province, upon your application, will give you
his assistance. Likewise, if he should perceive that the mandate has ceased to
have effect, he will not, on this account, refuse you an equitable action
against the debtor.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Prassens
and Albinus, 247.
5. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Aristodemus and
Proculus.
If you did not accept the entire amount of the loan, or did not voluntarily
bind yourself to your creditor by a stipulation, or you assumed the obligation
by appearing as surety for the principal debtor, although the money may have
been paid only to one person, you will have no reason to fear that the creditor
can sue you for money which he lent to another, if you prove that it has not
been counted out to you within the time prescribed by law. And you will have
still less cause for apprehension, if, instead of money, the transaction had
reference to the delivery of oil, where there was no stipulation that it should
be returned; and when a controversy arises on this point, he who has actually
received the money will be liable; but it is clear that, in accordance with the
terms of the instrument which refers to the delivery of the oil, nothing is
due.
Given on the fifth of the Nonesof May, during the above-mentioned Consulate,
293.
6. The Same, and the Csesars, to Nicander.
If a novation should be made with reference to a sum of money due for a certain
amount of merchandise, and you stipulate that interest shall be paid by the
person against whom you file your petition, even though the statement of the
amount of the merchandise due may be false, still, as the substance of the
obligation is not wanting, there is no reason why interest should not be
claimed in compliance with the terms of the contract. If, however, it had been
agreed without a stipulation that only the money which was borrowed should be
paid with interest, the false instruments would be considered as not having
been drawn up; for an agreement of this kind cannot alter the preceding
obligation.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof December, under the abovementioned
Consulate, 293.
7. The Same, and the Csesars, to Pactumeia.
The origin of money which is loaned should not be considered, but only whether
the person who made the contract counted it out to the one to whom it belonged,
is required in obligations of this kind.
Given on the fifth of the Nonesof October, under the above-mentioned Consulate,
293.
8. The Same, and the Csesars, to Proculus.
If, instead of the loan of money which you requested from your creditor, you
received silver, beasts of burden, or any other kind of property appraised by
mutual consent, and you gave him gold in pledge, although you may have promised
by a stipulation to pay him interest above one per cent a month, still, only
the principal which is mentioned in the agreement of the parties, and the legal
rate of interest can be claimed. You cannot, however, obtain any benefit on the
ground that the pledge which you gave is of inferior value, as you allege, in
order to avoid payment of the full amount which you received.
9. The Same, and the Caesars, to Alexander.
As you state in your petition that, while in Gaul, you, together with
Syntrophus, lent a certain weight of gold and a certain sum of money to someone
to be paid at Rome, if you apply to a competent judge and he decides that there
are two principal debtors under a stipulation, or that you are entitled to the
action for the full amount, or that you can collect from the heirs of
Syntrophus, he shall order the entire debt, or, on the other hand, what you
alone have paid, to be refunded to you.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the abovementioned
Consulate, 293.
10. The Same, and the Csesars, to Crispinus.
Payment should not be opposed because the evidence of the indebtedness of
several persons is contained in one and the same instrument; for if you have
stipulated, and the other parties have agreed that, instead of the money which
you have loaned, wine shall be given you, the change of mind of the others
cannot annul the contract which has been legally made.
Given on the second of the Nonesof February, during the abovementioned
Consulate, 293.
11. The Same, and the Csesars, to Maximian.
A fire does not release a debtor from the payment of his obligation. Given on
the second of the Idesof February, under the abovementioned Consulate, 293.
12. The Same, and the Csesars, to Theophanius.
If, together with lo, you have borrowed money in connection with' your common
business, you will not be liable for the entire amount
of the debt, either on account of the property, or by reason of the formula
used in the contract; and even though afterwards you may have paid the entire
amount, you will have a right of action against lo for the recovery of your
share of the debt before a competent judge. Given on the fifteenth of the
Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of the Caesars, 300.
13. The Same, and the Cassars, to Pronto.
He who has borrowed a sum of money will be liable to his creditor, even though
it is to be used for the business of another, if the creditor, at the time when
he lent it, did not have in view the person for the benefit of whose affairs it
was obtained.
Given at Nicomedia, on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof November, during the
Consulate of the Caesars, 300.
14. The Same, and the Cassars, to Hadrian.
A creditor who lent money to others did not render you liable, unless you
signed a written contract evidencing the loan.
Given during the Consulate of the above-mentioned Emperors, without any date.
15. The Same, and the Cassars, to Charidemus.
You ask for something which is plainly contrary to law, when you demand that
creditors shall not proceed against you who borrowed the money, but against the
heirs of the person to whom you lent it.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof December, under the Consulate of the
Caesars.
16. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Theodore, Praetorian Prefect.
Anyone who lends money at interest to a judge shall, if he resides in his
jurisdiction, be considered as the purchaser of the laws of the province; or,
if anyone should corruptly pay someone who is his fellow-candidate for an
office, he shall, along with the judge, be condemned to the penalty of exile.
Given on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of
Bassus and Philip, 408.
17. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Praetorian Prefect.
We have considered that the following provisions with reference to written
instruments should be enacted for the common welfare; namely, that when anyone
desires to borrow more than fifty pounds of gold, or to receive security for a
debt, and the sum exceeds that above-mentioned, he is hereby notified that the
instrument evidencing the debt shall not be recognized either by the debtor or
the creditor, unless the said instrument contains the signature of three
witnesses of established reputation. For if any written instrument executed in
violation of this rule and calling for the payment of a sum in gold exceeding
that above-mentioned is introduced, it shall, under no circumstances, be
admitted by the judge.
This rule shall be applicable to future loans and payments of debts. Given at
Constantinople, on the tenth of the Kalendsof June, during the second Consulate
of Our Lord Justinian, 528.
Extract from Novel 73, Chapter I. Latin Text.
By a new law, however, five witnesses are necessary, if the contract is in
writing, and was made by a person who was illiterate, and who resided in the
city, if the debt was for more than a pound of gold. When anyone desires to
make a verbal contract, it is evident that he can do so either by making use of
witnesses, or by taking the oath; and in case an action should be brought, the
plaintiff must produce the witnesses, and can either be compelled to take the
oath himself or to tender it, as the judge may determine.
The laws relating to contracts made in the country, which have been, up to this
time, valid, are hereby confirmed.
TITLE III.
CONCERNING SUFFRAGE.
1. The Emperors Theodosius, Arcadius, and Honorius to Rufinus, Prastorian
Prefect.
If persons desiring to obtain what they seek have requested anyone to vote for
them, and have bound themselves to give him something in return, they must keep
their promises, and carry out what they voluntarily agreed to do. If they
should, under any pretext, delay to do so, they shall be compelled to pay what
is due.
(1) If any gold, silver, or other movable property should be given on this
account, delivery alone will be sufficient, and the contract shall remain
forever valid; for when the delivery of movable property is made, it is done
with good faith, and for a consideration.
(2) If the contract includes the delivery of a rustic or urban estate, an
instrument in writing should be drawn up showing that the property has been
transferred to another, actual delivery should follow, and the instrument show
that the transaction was complete; for otherwise the property cannot pass to
the new owner, or the old one be divested of his title.
(3) If the person who has been asked to give his vote should seize the property
agreed upon as compensation, his rashness and violence shall be restrained, and
possession of the property shall be restored to its former owner, and he who
did not hesitate to seize what he ought to have demanded shall be excluded from
obtaining it by law.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Nonesof March, dur-, ing the
Consulate of Arcadius, Consul for the third time, and Honorius, Consul for the
second time, 394.
TITLE IV. CONCERNING THE PROHIBITED SEQUESTRATION OF MONEY.
1. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to John, Praetorian Prefect.
Whenever money is demanded by virtue of some contract, necessity for its
sequestration does not exist; for it is necessary for the existence of the debt
to be first proved, and then the debtor be compelled to make payment. It is
required, not so much by the rule of law as by equity itself, that the creditor
should produce the evidence of the debt, and, bringing suit for the money,
establish the liability of the debtor.
Given at Ravenna, on the sixth of the Idesof July, during the Consulate of
Honorius, Consul for the thirteenth time, and Theodosius, Consul for the tenth
time, 422.
TITLE V.
CONCERNING THE RECOVERY OF A DEBT WHICH WAS PAID WITHOUT BEING DUE.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Mutianus.
There is no doubt that money which has been paid through mistake, and not by
virtue of a judgment, can legally be recovered by a personal action. Therefore
if you can prove that your father, whose heir you became, paid his creditor
more than he owed him, you can recover the amount of the excess. You will,
however, in vain demand the interest on this sum, as by the personal action
only that amount can be recovered which was paid when it was not due.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Antoninus,
Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 223.
2. The Same to Secundina.
Where, without any arrangement having been made with reference to it, you have
been delegated to promise the creditor of another money which you do not owe,
you will have the right to bring a personal action against the person who
delegated you.
Given on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Antoninus, Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 293.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Pamphilus.
As a sum of money which was not due, and which has been paid through ignorance
can be recovered, an action on a written contract will be much more available
for the recovery of money not owing, or an exception on the ground of bad faith
can be pleaded against the plaintiff.
Given on the third of the Nonesof April, at Byzantium, during the above-
mentioned Consulate, 293.
4. The Same, and the Cassars, to Heraclius.
It is a positive rule of law that sums of money which are liable to increase
through denial in litigation cannot be recovered, even if, when not due, they
have been paid by someone ignorant of the fact. It is, however, established
that there will not be ground for a personal action for recovery, if a bond for
the payment of money not due has been given.
Given at Byzantium, on the fifth of the Idesof April, during the above-
mentioned Consulate, 293.
5. The Same, and the Csssars, to Attains.
If, having been emancipated by your father, you did not succeed him within the
time prescribed by praetorian law, it is certain that you, as the heir of your
father, will have a right to recover by a personal action anything which you
may have subsequently paid by mistake.
Given on the fourth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors, 293.
6. The Same, and the Csesars, to Mnasea.
When, through ignorance of fact, you have paid for another a sum of money which
was not due, and this has been proved before the Governor of the province, he
shall, on the demand of him who paid it, provide for its return to the person
on account of whom it was advanced.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof August, during the above-mentioned Consulate,
293.
7. The Same, and the Csesars, to Dionysia.
It is an established rule of law that a trust or a legacy which, through an
error of fact, was delivered when it was not due, can be recovered.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof September, during the abovementioned
Consulate, 293.
8. The Same, and the C&sars, to Zyparus.
Where anyone has paid a false agent of his creditor, he has a right of recovery
against the latter, but not to a release from his obligation.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof November, during the above-mentioned
Consulate, 293.
9. The Same, and the Csesars, to Gratiana.
Anyone who knows that payment has been made of a sum which was not due cannot
legally recover it. Where, however, property belonging to another has been sold
without a mandate, and after it has been evicted either for this reason or for
some other defect in the title, the owner indemnifies the purchaser, he cannot
allege that the money was not due; as having proved by an act of this kind that
he ratified the contract, he shows that what he paid was due.
Given at Nicomedia, on the fourth of the Nonesof December, during the Consulate
of the Csesars, 294.
10. The Emperor Justinian to Julian, Prtetorian Prefect.
Where anyone promises a slave, who is designated, or a certain sum of solidi,or
any other property, and, by delivering either of these, he has the right to be
released from his obligation, if he, through ignorance, should deliver both, a
doubt arose which could be recovered by the laws, that is to say, whether he
could recover the slave or the money, and whether the stipulator or the
promisor had the power to make the selection of the property.
Ulpian grants the choice to the person who received both, to return whichever
he wishes, and states that both Marcellus and Celsus agree with him.
Papinianus, however, gives the right of selection to him who delivered both
pieces of property, because, before delivering them, he had the right to
deliver whichever he chose; and he quotes the great authority of Salvius
Julianus, the interpreter of the Praetorian Edict, in support of his opinion.
In deciding the question, We have adopted the view of Julianus and Papinianus
that he who had the right to give either of the pieces of property was also
entitled to choose which he should receive.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof August, under the fifth Consulate of
Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
11. The Same to Julian, Prtetorian Prefect.
A dispute arose among jurists with reference to the hesitation of those who
have paid money while uncertain whether or not it was due, and whether they
could recover that which they had paid while in doubt. In deciding this
question, We decree that all those who have paid while uncertain whether or not
they owed the money, or anything else which they gave, should not be denied the
right of recovery, and that the presumption of a compromise should not be
alleged against them, unless this was specifically established by the adverse
party.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof October, under the fifth Consulate of
Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
TITLE VI.
CONCERNING THE ACTION FOR RECOVERY OF PROPERTY GIVEN FOR SOME CONSIDERATION.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Callisthenides.
You state that a sum of money was received by you by way of dowry, under an
agreement (as is customary when a marriage contract is entered into) ; and if
some obstacle has arisen to prevent the marriage from being celebrated
according to law, you can recover the said sum by a personal action, and the
agreement which was made should be considered as if it had never been entered
into.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Lsetus,
Consul for the second time, and Cerealis, 216.
2. The Emperor Alexander to Asclepiades.
If, as you state, your father gave your sister certain lands and other property
which you have mentioned, under the condition that she should satisfy the
creditors, and that, if the condition was not fulfilled, the donation should be
void, and as she did not comply with the condition, it is not unjust that the
action for recovery of the property donated should be granted you as the heir
of your father.
Given on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of
Albinus and Maximus, 228.
3. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus to Aurelius and Alexandra.
A donation was made to you under the condition that neither of you should have
the power to dispose of his or her share of the estate, and the result of this
is, that neither of you can alienate the ownership of your share; and if the
condition should not be observed, the donor, or his heir, will be entitled to
an action to recover the property.
Given on the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Valerian, Consul for the
fourth time, and Gallienus, Consul for the third time, 258.
4. The So/me, and the Caesar Valerian, to ^Emilia.
If, having actually received a very small sum of money, you acknowledge the
receipt of a much larger one, for the reason that your adversary promised you
his influence, and as you allege that he did not keep his word, you can, by
means of a personal action, be released from the obligation which you
contracted, on the ground that you did not receive the expected influence in
consideration of which you entered into the agreement.
Given on the Kalendsof May, under the Consulate of ^milianus and Bassus, 260.
5. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Ciesars, to Martial.
If you appointed a soldier your attorney for the transaction of your business,
when this was forbidden by law, and on account of his appointment you paid him
a sum of money, a competent judge will see that whatever you have disbursed on
this account shall be refunded to you, without the case having been heard.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of the same
Emperors; the first, Consul for the fourth time, and the second, Consul for the
third time, 290.
6. The Same, and the Csesars, to Cyrio and Plotio.
You say that your father presented a female slave to the person against whom
you have instituted proceedings, and it makes a great
deal of difference whether he made the donation with the intention of giving or
of manumitting the girl whom he believed to be a female slave; for when a gift
has been perfected it cannot be revoked, and where the intention to do so did
not exist, an action for recovery will lie.
Given on the second of the Idesof May, during the above-mentioned Consulate,
293.
7. The Same, and the Csesars, to Gerontius.
If you have given anything to the wife of a person whom you intended by this
act of liberality to induce to travel with you, and you did not add any
condition of recovery, the gift will remain unimpaired; as it is contrary to
law for a perfect donation to be revoked by the indecision of the donor.
Given on the seventh of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors, 293.
8. The Same, and the Csesars, to Flavian.
A rule of law provides that there is ground for a personal action for recovery,
when the condition attached to a donation not being impossible, it was not
complied with by him who agreed to it; therefore when you gave your property to
your betrothed as a token of your liberality, and imposed a certain condition,
and she did not comply with it, although she could have done so, you will not
be prevented from suing her heirs to recover what you gave her, if you should
so desire.
Given on the third of the Idesof February, during the abovementioned Consulate,
293.
9. The Same, and the Csesars, to Eibulus.
If you, being free, have given something in order that your daughters may be
manumitted, and proceedings are not instituted for this purpose, you will be
entitled to an action for the recovery of what you gave.
If, however, a slave should donate something out of his peculium,to his master,
he can have no right of action against him; but if he should appear before the
Governor of the province, the latter will, taking into consideration the
respect due to the master, exhort him who permitted himself to receive the
money in consideration of granting freedom to the slave to abide by his
agreement in favor of liberty.
Given on the third of the Idesof February, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors, 299.
10. The Same, and the Csesars, to Canoniana.
It is certain that you can, by no means, recover money which has been paid by
you, if the condition on which it was dependent failed to take place, not
through the fault of the person who received it, but because of some accident.
Given at Nicomedia, on the third of the Nonesof December, during the Consulate
of the Csesars, 300.
11. The Same, and the Caesars, to Stratonica.
It has been established that money paid to an advocate for his services should
be refunded, if it is proved that he was to blame for not complying with his
contract.
Given on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
Csesars, 300.
TITLE VII.
CONCERNING THE ACTION FOR RECOVERY ON ACCOUNT OF A DISHONORABLE CONSIDERATION.
1. The Emperors Antoninus to Ingemms.
If suit is brought against you on your bond, and you have received no money,
and your bond was furnished for an infamous consideration, and one which is
prohibited, and this is proved in the presence of the judge having jurisdiction
of the case, when this has been accomplished, you will be released from
liability.
2. The Same to Longinus.
As you allege that you have transferred your house to your adversary for a
dishonorable consideration, and one contrary to the principles of My reign, you
will in vain ask that it be restored to you, for in a case of this kind the
condition of the possessor is considered to be the better.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of
Lsetus, Consul for the second time, and Cerealis, 216.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to the Soldier Dizon.
If it is established by indisputable evidence before a competent judge that you
have paid a sum of money to the person of whom you complain, in order to avoid
military service, you can recover it with his assistance; and he, being mindful
of public censure, after the money has been refunded, will not suffer the crime
of extortion to remain unpunished.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors; the first, Consul for the fourth time, and the second,
Consul for the third time, 290.
4. The Same, and the Ceesars, to Rufinus.
Where a dishonorable consideration is found to have been offered by both
parties, although the contract may have been complied with, an action for
recovery will be granted only for what was paid, and not for the interest on
the same.
Given on the seventh of the Idesof January, during the above mentioned
Consulate, 293.
5. The Same, and the Csesars, to Bichoporus.
Since you acknowledge that your wife led the life of a prostitute, you
understand that your petition contains the confession that you
have acted as a pander, and therefore no ground will exist for the recovery of
a sum of money paid for such an infamous consideration. For although baseness
may have existed on both sides, and the money paid cannot be recovered, still,
it is established by the authority of the law that actions based upon a
stipulation entered into contrary to good morals should be refused.
Given on the Idesof May, during the Consulate of the Caesars, 294.
6. The Same, and the Csesars, to Eutychia.
It is settled that where money has been received by anyone to induce him to
restore property which he had stolen, as he only is guilty of dishonorable
conduct, he can be compelled to refund it by a personal action.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 294.
7. The Same, and the Csesars, to Zeno.
It has been decided that he who receives money to induce him to restore cattle
which he had driven away must not only refund the money which he acquired by
his act, but also the cattle, even though they are said to have died, or to
have perished by some accident, as in this case he will be found to be in
default.
Given at Nicomedia, on the fifth of the Kalendsof December, during the above-
mentioned Consulate, 299.
TITLE Vill.
CONCERNING THE ACTION FOR THE RECOVERY OP STOLEN PROPERTY.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Hermogenes.
The Governor of the province, being aware of the facts, shall be careful to
declare in his decision that each party is liable for the entire amount in an
action of theft; but where the action for the recovery of stolen money has been
brought, and the judgment has been satisfied by one of the parties, the others
are released.
Given on the Kalendsof May, under the Consulate of the Caesars, 294.
2. The Same, and the Csesars, to Aristenetus.
It is a well-established rule of law that a sheep thief shall bear the loss of
stolen property, if this occurs before his offer to make restitution.
Given on the Kalendsof May, under the Consulate of the Caesars, 294.
TITLE IX.
CONCERNING THE PERSONAL SUIT FOR RECOVERY UNDER
THE LAW, WHERE THERE is No CONSIDERATION, OR
WHERE THE CONSIDERATION is UNJUST.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, to Ulpiiis.
Although debts cannot be collected before they are due, still, if you are a
debtor to the Treasury on account of your administration as the captain of the
first company of the triarii,and the Governor of the province finds that your
property is exhausted to such an extent that payment of the debt can only be
made by the employment of a single sum of money which is due to you, he shall
notify your debtor, provided he is solvent, to discharge the debt before the
time fixed for doing so, in order that what is due may be paid to the Treasury
which, on account of the public requirements, should obtain the preference.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 294.
2. The Same, and the Csesars, to Sculatius.
No doubt exists as to the law which provides that where the instrument which
established the payment of the debt is retained by the creditor, it will be of
no advantage to him while it remains in his hands, and therefore it can be
recovered by a personal action.
Given on the third of the Nonesof April, during the Consulate of the Csesars,
300.
3. The Same, and the Cse.sars, to Galatia.
A possessor in bad faith, who has been defeated in an action where the
ownership of property is involved, can be compelled to surrender any existing
crops belonging to the property by an action for their recovery, and can be
sued in a personal action for those which have been consumed.
Given on the Idesof February, during the Consulate of the Caesars, 300.
4. The Same, and the Caesars, to Alexander.
If the sum which you stated in writing you received as a loan has never been
counted out to you, and the time prescribed by law within which you can bring
suit has not yet transpired, you can ask the Governor that notice be served for
the return of the obligation.
Given on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 300.



TITLE X. CONCERNING OBLIGATIONS AND ACTIONS.

1. The Emperor Gordian to Valeria.
You state that a certain sum of money has been given by you to a person whom
you mention, and in return for which he has assigned
you a right of action against the debtor, for whom you paid the money; and,
before you brought suit on this account, you allege that the creditor died
without leaving an heir. Since this is the case, a praetorian action will lie
in your favor.
Given on the fifth of the Kalends ofMay, during the Consulate of Atticus and
Prsetextatus, 243.

2. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus to Celsus.
It has been frequently stated in rescripts that where claims have been given by
way of dowry, although no delegation was previously made, nor any proceedings
were subsequently instituted, a praetorian action should be granted the
husband, just as in the case of someone who had purchased a note.
Given on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of
Secularus and Donatus, 255.

3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Rusticianus.
It is extremely inequitable for tenants to be sued on account of the private
indebtedness of their lessor, where they pay the rent in accordance with their
contracts.
Given on the day before the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and Aquilinus, 286.

4. The Same, and the Csesars, to Licinia.
It is no more than just for good faith to be taken into consideration in all
contracts.
Given on the third of the Nonesof October, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors, 287.

5. The Same, and the Csesars, to Camerinus and Martian.
As in the beginning everyone has free power to make or not to make contracts,
so where an obligation has once been entered into neither party can, without
the consent of his adversary, reject it. Wherefore you should understand that
when you have once been bound by a voluntary agreement, you can, under no
circumstances, repudiate it, without the consent of the other party whom you
mention in your petition.
Given at Byzantium, on the Nonesof April, under the above-mentioned Consulate,
290.

6. The Same, and the Csesars, to Mauritius.
If your debtor has given you in payment a claim which was due to him, and
appointed you his attorney in the matter, demand the pledges which were
specially or generally deposited to secure the debt. If, however, they are
proved to have been sold by those to whom they were previously pledged, because
of their having the preference, understand that you cannot demand them of the
purchasers.
Given on the ninth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors, 293.

7. The Same, and the Csesars, to Dionysius.
If you have purchased a claim from a creditor, demand the pledges which the
vendor could have obtained in the presence of the Governor of the province. For
if you hold the property which was pledged for the debt of the said person and
it is not paid, you are not forbidden by the Common Law to sell the pledges.
When, however, those who possessed the pledges having a preferred lien upon
them have purchased them from the creditors, or if they are protected by
prescription based upon long time, understand that you will not have the power
to sell the pledges.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof January, during the abovementioned
Consulate, 293.

8. The Same, and the Csesars, to Grescentius.
Where, for the purpose of making a donation to a person whom you state that you
have loved with the affection of a father, you gave him a sum of money, and he,
for the purpose of remunerating your liberality, asks you to accept another sum
from his attorney, and before you receive it, he dies, you cannot recover what
you have given, for the reason that the donation was perfected, nor can you
demand from his attorney what his constituent directed to be given to you but
was not yet delivered. If, however, you have lent the amount, but did not
stipulate that it should be paid by someone who had been delegated on account
of a novation, his heirs will be compelled to pay you.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of the
Csesars, 294.

9. The Same, and the Caesars, to Glyco.
Debtors who deny that they owe anything should not be intimidated by armed
force, but should be discharged from liability if the plaintiff does not prove
his case, or if he should be barred by an exception; but if their indebtedness
should be established, and judgment be rendered against them, it is settled
that they must be compelled to make payment by the employment of all legal
remedies.
Given on the Idesof February, during the Consulate of the Caesars, 294.

10. The Same, and the Csesars, to Fufinus.
The right of personal action against a debtor is not extinguished by the sale
of the pledges, but what can be obtained by it shall be credited on the debt,
and suit can be brought for the remainder.
Given on the third of the Nonesof April, during the Consulate of the Caesars,
294.

11. The Same, and the Csesars, to Paula.
You deceived yourself when you thought you could collect from the owner of the
land what you lent to his tenants on their own account, for the presence of his
agents does not enable you to hold him liable.
Given on the eighth of the Kalends ofAugust, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 294.

12. The Same, and the Csesars, to Jovinus.
The laws do not suffer children to be given up to the service of creditors
because of debts due by their parents.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of the
Csesars, 294.
Extract from Novel 134, Chapter VII. Latin Text.
Moreover, the creditor will lose his debt, and will be compelled to pay an
equal amount to the child whom he has retained, or to his parents, and he will
also be liable to corporeal penalties.

13. The Same, and the Csesars, to Barsumius.
You should compel the person to whom you have lent money to make payment by
means of an adequate legal proceeding, for you have no right of action against
traders who you alleged exhausted the funds of your debtor by the sale of
merchandise to him.
Given on the eleventh of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 300.

14. The Same, and the Csesars, to Hermodorus and Nicoma-chus.
You have the choice either to sue the heirs of your debtor by a personal
action, or to make use of the Servian Action against him who holds the pledges
which were given to you, and which have been sold and delivered to him by the
heirs, if he is not protected by prescription based upon long time; or you can
bring both actions simultaneously.
Given at Nicomedia, on the fifth of the Kalendsof December, during the
Consulate of the Csesars, 300.
Extract from, Novel 4, Chapter HI. Latin Text.
At present, however, under the new law, all trustees, mandators, and sureties
must first be sued before having recourse to those in possession of the
pledges.


TITLE XI
ACTIONS SHOULD BE BROUGHT BY HEIRS AND AGAINST HEIRS.

1. The Emperor Justinian to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
In former times, stipulations, legacies, and other contracts to be executed
after death were rejected, but We have permitted this to be done for the common
welfare of mankind, as it appeared to be advisable that this rule, which was
adopted in ancient times, should be amended by a more humane custom; for the
old jurists did not allow actions to be brought by or against heirs in the case
of stipulations
or other agreements to be carried out after death. It seems to Us to be
necessary to abolish this ancient abuse, and to annul this rule, so that suits
and obligations can be brought and enforced by heirs and against heirs, in
order that the accomplishment of the wishes of the contracting parties may not
be frustrated, through the excessive subtlety of the legal terms employed.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof November, after the
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.


TITLE XII.
A WIFE CANNOT BE SUED ON ACCOUNT OF HER HUSBAND,
OR A HUSBAND ON ACCOUNT OF His WIFE, OR A MOTHER
ON ACCOUNT OF HER SON.

1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Asclepiodota.
You will argue in vain with reference to the validity of contracts made by your
husband, as it is sufficient for your protection that you made no contract in
your own name to prevent your being sued on his account; for, under the terms
of the Decree of the Senate, nothing can legally be collected from you, even if
you have voluntarily offered yourself as his, surety.
Given on the day before the Idesof April, during the Consulate of Diocletian,
Consul for the third time, and Maximian, 287.
2. The Same to Terentia.
The laws forbid that women should be annoyed on account of the faults of their
husbands. Hence the Imperial Accountant, where property has been seized by the
Treasury and you can prove that it is yours, must obey the public law.
Given on the third of the Nonesof September, during the Consulate of Diocletian
and Maximian, 287.
3. The Same, and the Csesars, to Carpophorus.
As you allege that you have not given the property in question to your
daughter, by way of dowry, but for her support exclusive of the dowry, these
lands are not subject to civil or municipal charges of a husband, any more than
mothers can be rendered liable for debts due from their sons; as it is settled
that a husband cannot be sued for an obligation contracted by his wife, unless
he himself became surety for the same, since it is perfectly clear that no one
can be liable for the contract of another.
Given on the third of the Idesof September, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors, 293.
4. The Same, and the Cassars, to Philotera.
As you state that you have been sued on account of the indebtedness of your son
for the reason that you have already appeared to
have paid a portion of the same, you have a perfect right to avail yourself of
your means before the judge having jurisdiction of the case, so that he may
prevent you from being compelled to pay the debts of another.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of Titian
and Nepotian, 301.
Extract from Novel 52, Chapter I. Latin Text.
Anyone who attempts to make use of the property of one person to pay the debts
of another, just as if it was pledged for that purpose, shall be compelled to
repay fourfold its value, whatever that may be, to "the person who suffered the
wrong, and shall lose his right of action to recover the debt for the payment
of which he took the property.


TITLE XIII.
A SON CANNOT BE SUED ON ACCOUNT OF His FATHER,
OR A FATHER ON ACCOUNT OP His EMANCIPATED SON, OR
A FREEDMAN ON ACCOUNT OF His PATRON, OR A SLAVE
ON ACCOUNT OF His MASTER.

1. The Emperor Gordian to the Soldier Candidus.
A father cannot be sued on account of the debt of his son who is his own
master, where he did not become his surety; nor can he be sued for it when he
is under his control, if he made the contract without his consent; nor will he
be liable where, contrary to the terms of the Macedonian Decree of the Senate,
a larger sum was lent than the value of the peculium.Wherefore, if your father
has had money extorted from him by the creditor of your brother, for the
payment of a debt for which he was not liable, he can recover it with the aid
of the Governor of the province.
Given on the third of the Nonesof October, during the Consulate of Pius and
Pontianus, 239.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Neotherius and Eutolmiis.
The Governor of the province must provide that you shall not, contrary to law,
be annoyed by someone by whom your father, who you allege has emancipated you,
has been called to assume a civil office.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and Aquilinus, 286.
3. The Same, and the Csssars, to Theogenes.
Where a son has been appointed a decurion without the consent of his father, it
has been very clearly provided by law that his father cannot be annoyed on his
account.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of the Caesars,
294.
4. The Same, and the Ciesars, to Achiva.
It is settled that a son cannot be sued in a personal action on account of the
indebtedness of his father, or be liable for his municipal charges if his
father is still living.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof March, under the Consulate of the
Caesars, 300.
5. The Same, and the Ciesars, to Lampetim.
Neither freedmen nor slaves can be sued on account of contracts made by their
patrons and masters.
Given on the Idesof April, during the Consulate of the Caesars, 300.
A New Constitution of Frederick.
After a careful investigation and examination made by the bishops, abbots,
dukes, and other officials of Our Sacred Palace, We grant the following
privilege to all those who journey for the purpose of study, and especially to
the professors of Divine and Imperial laws, namely: that they, as well as their
messengers, shall remain secure in the places in which they reside. For as they
all do good, We think that they are worthy of Our praise and protection at all
times, as the entire world is illuminated by their learning, and Our subjects
are instructed by them to be obedient to God and Our ministers; and therefore,
by means of this special favor, We desire to guard them against all injury. For
who is there who would not pity those who, having become exiles through the
love of learning, and from being wealthy have become poor, and exhaust their
strength, and expose their lives to many dangers, and frequently suffer bodily
injury from the vilest of mankind without a cause, which is hard to bear?
Therefore We decree by this general law, which shall be valid for all time,
that no one shall dare to presume to inflict injury upon students, or cause
them any loss on account of the crime or indebtedness of another, in any
province whatsoever (which We have ascertained is sometimes done in accordance
with an improper custom).
Those who violate this Sacred Constitution, as well as the Governors of the
places in which they live, and who neglect to punish them, are hereby notified
that they shall be compelled to pay fourfold damages, be branded by the law
with infamy, and be forever dismissed from their employments. If, however,
anyone should desire to institute legal proceedings against such persons,
because of any transaction, this shall be done at the option of the students,
either before their master or professor or the bishop of the city, upon whom We
have conferred this jurisdiction. Anyone who attempts to bring them before
another judge, even if his claim should be perfectly just, shall lose his case.
We order that this law shall be inserted among the Imperial Constitutions under
this Title: "A son shall not be sued on account of his father, etc."
Given during the month of November, 1158.


TITLE XIV.
WHETHER A SLAVE is LIABLE FOR His OWN ACT AFTER His MANUMISSION.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Juventian.
Although you have made a contract with a slave who is to be free under a
condition, you should know that after the condition upon which his liberty
depends has been complied with, you will have no right of action against him
for what he may have previously done.
Given on the fourth of the Idesof December, during the Consulate of Dexter,
Consul for the second time, and Priscus, 197.
2. The Emperor Antoninus to Bexicus.
No action will lie against you in favor of your creditors who lent you money
while in slavery, especially as you state that no peculiumwas bequeathed to
you.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of Laetus
and Cerealis, 216.
3. The Emperor Alexander to Herod.
Where money has been promised to you by your slave, in consideration of your
manumitting him, and after you have done so you do not make any stipulation
with him, you will be entitled to an action in factumagainst him.
Given on the Idesof September, during the Consulate of Alexander, 227.
4. The Emperor Gordian to Hiero.
A slave who is said to have stolen a sum of money from your mother cannot be
sued for an offence of this kind, although this may have been done at the time
that she was in slavery, but having once obtained her freedom, she will be
liable to an action of theft; for the injury follows the person.
Given on the Idesof September, during the Consulate of Pius and Pontianus, 239.
5. The Same to Chrestus.
If, as you allege, you cultivated your master's land before you were manumitted
by him, and you were afterwards presented with your freedom, but were deprived
of your peculium,any property which you may have previously contractd for, or
have acquired by your own labor after your manumission, can by no means be
taken from you.
Given on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of Arian
and Pappus, 344.
6. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Felicianus.
If those whom you mention in your petition are slaves, dispose of their cases
at home, because no action at law can exist between masters and slaves. If,
however, they were manumitted after committing
the offence, there is no legal rule which permits suit to be brought by their
former masters for anything which had been done by them before they were
enfranchised. But where they have committed any illegal act after their
manumission, you must prove this before the Governor of the province, and you
will obtain a decision in accordance with law.
Given on the second of the Idesof April, at Byzantium, during the Consulate of
the above-mentioned Emperors, 287.


TITLE XV.
WHEN THE TREASURY, OR A PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL, CAN OR SHOULD SUE DEBTORS OR THEIR
DEBTORS.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Valerian.
The property of a guardian, who holds nothing belonging to his ward, cannot be
seized on account of the debts of the latter.
Given on the eleventh of the Kalendsof June, under the Consulate of Lateranus
and Rufinus, 198.
2. The Emperor Antoninus to Marcus.
If, in the case of a judgment against Valens, which you state that you have
obtained, nothing can be sold without having recourse to execution; his
debtors, having been sued, will be compelled to make payment by the authority
of the Governor of the province.
3. The Emperor Gordian to Primanius.
If those persons whom you allege are indebted to the debtors of the Treasury do
not deny their liability, what you ask does not seem to be unjust, that is to
say, that they be compelled to make payment by the Attorney of the Treasury.
When, however, any question arises with reference to this, you yourself will
perceive that it should not be permitted.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of Sabinus
and Venustus, 241.
4. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Zosimus.
It is a positive rule of law that suit cannot be brought by the Treasury
against persons who are indebted to the debtors of the Treasury, unless it is
clearly established that the latter are not solvent.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors, 293.
5. The Same, and the Csesars, to Nanida.
When a claim has been given in satisfaction of a debt, the creditor cannot
proceed against the debtors of the person who has made payment in this way,
unless he assigns his rights of action; but he can legally avail himself of an
equitable action in his own name.
Given on the Kalendsof January, under the Consulate of the Caesars, 294.


TITLE XVI. CONCERNING HEREDITARY ACTIONS.
1. The Emperor Gordian to Hermerotiis.
You should demand the money which you say was owing to you from your mother in
proportion to the share to which you are entitled from her heirs, who are your
co-heirs; but you will not be prevented from attempting to collect what is due
to you out of the property encumbered for the debt.
Given on the eleventh of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Gordian,
Consul for the second time, and Pompeianus, 242.
2. The Emperor Decius to Telemacha.
It has been decided that heirs are liable for hereditary charges in proportion
to their shares of the estate, even where the said charges are those of the
Treasury, unless property has been pledged or hypothecated, for then the
possessor of the encumbered property should be sued.
Given on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of
.ZEmilianus and Aquilinus, 250.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Maxima.
Sue the heir of your former husband for the restoration of your dowry, as you
will in vain ask that a personal action be granted you against the debtors of
the estate.
Given on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof May, during the abovementioned
Consulate, 293.
4. The Same, and the Csesars, to Crispus.
It is perfectly clear that payment of the debt cannot be deferred under the
pretext that the debtor of the estate is under age, and therefore, as you state
that you are his guardian, you should endeavor to have him satisfy his
creditors.
Given on'the tenth of the Kalendsof December, under the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors, 293.
5. The Same, and the Csesars, to Julius.
As you ask in your petition that a debt shall be paid before the estate is
entered upon, We order inquiry to be made whether it belongs to you, or not;
for if it should be established that you have a right to the estate of your
father-in-law, there is no doubt that the claim for the debt is extinguished by
merger.
Given on the day before the Nonesof March, during the Consulate of the Csesars,
294.
6. The Same, and the Csssars, to Domnus.
Ifthe adult girl (whose guardianship you state that you have administered), and
whose curator you now are, is the heir to a third
of her paternal uncle's estate, and has not been forbidden to acquire anything
from it, she will be permitted to collect a debt from her coheirs in proportion
to two-thirds of the estate, as the claim is not merged except with reference
to the share to which she is entitled; for it is against the interest of your
ward that you ask that the will be set aside, since the co-heirs bind
themselves for payment when they accept the estate. And if, after a division of
the property has been made, it should be proved that they are not solvent, the
Governor of the province will see that she sustains no loss.
Given on the Kalendsof December, during the above-mentioned Consulate, 299.
7. The Same, and the Ctesars, to Apolaustus.
It is settled that the creditors of the estate are not entitled to a personal
action against the legatee, as the Law of the Twelve Tables undoubtedly renders
the heirs liable to such an action.
Given at Nicomedia, on the sixth of the Idesof December, during the Consulate
of the Csesars, 300.
TITLE XVII.
FOR WHAT AN AMOUNT HEIRS CAN BE SUED ON ACCOUNT OF THE CRIMES OF DECEASED
PERSONS.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Macedonus.
It is an absolute rule of law that where anyone has been guilty of violence,
extortion, or any other crime, and then dies after issue has been joined in the
case, his heirs will be liable in full; otherwise they can only be sued for
what has come into their hands, lest they may profit by the illegal act of
another.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of the Csesars,
294.
TITLE XVIII. CONCERNING THE SUM OF MONEY AGREED UPON.
1. The Emperor Gordian to Felix.
If you have consented to discharge someone else's debt, the action to recover
the money which you have promised to pay can not only be brought against you,
but also against your heirs, without limitation of time.
Given on the seventh of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
Extract from Novel 115, Chapter VI. Latin Text.
Where anyone agrees to pay a sum of money for himself or for some other person,
or promises to do so, saying, "I will pay you,"
he will be liable for the amount which he agreed to pay. If, however, he should
say, "You shall be paid by me, and by So-and-So and So-and-So," without the
consent of the persons whom he mentioned, he will only be liable pro ratafor
the amount for which he obligated himself. But when making use of the
impersonal verb, he says, "It shall be paid," he will not be responsible. If,
however, he should say, "You shall be paid either by me, or by So-and-So," and
he whom he mentioned does not consent, he alone will be liable in full.
2. The Emperor Justinian to John, Pretoria/n Prefect.
The Actio receptitia,which is founded on formal statements, having fallen into
disuse, it seems to Us necessary to extend the application of the Actio
pecuniss constitutive.Therefore, as this action for recovery was formerly only
available where the property in question could be weighed, counted, or
measured, and was not applicable to all cases, but, in certain instances, could
only be brought during the term of a year; and as it was doubtful whether it
was possible for it to be brought to collect a debt dependent upon a condition,
or whose payment was fixed at a certain time, or whether it could be employed
merely with reference to a sum unconditionally agreed upon; We direct, by this
perfectly clear law, that all persons shall be permitted to contract, not only
for property which can be weighed, counted, or measured, but also for every
other kind, whether it is movable or immovable, or can move itself, or is
established by documents; and, in short, for everything which men can make the
subject of a stipulation.
We also direct that the action, in every instance, shall not be limited to a
year, but whether the person contracts for himself or someone else, it can be
brought for the same period which is permitted in all personal actions, that is
to say, during the term of thirty years; and that it shall be lawful to .agree
to pay the debt absolutely; or at a certain time; or under some condition; and
that it shall have all the force of a stipulation, and still not be deprived in
any respect of its natural privileges, but can be brought both by and against
heirs, so that the State, in cases of this kind, may not need the aid of the
Actio receptitia;but that this action for the recovery of money promised will,
by Our Constitution, be sufficient in all respects, and be an inherent part of
the same, and that the agreement may take the place of the obligation; while,
on the other hand, by means of the ancient Actio receptitia,the debt could be
collected, even if it was not due.
It is perfectly absurd and contrary to the practice of Our age, as well as
opposed to just laws, to permit property which is not due to be recovered by
the Actio receptitia,and to re-establish many suits which will authorize the
collection of money which is not owing, and promises for payment to be
alternately abrogated and renewed. In order that such a conflict of laws may
not be productive of reproach, agreements can only be made for the payment of
what is due, and everything relating to the Actio receptitiawhich has been
inserted in the different books of legislators is hereby abolished; and the
Actio
pecuniss constituteshall include all cases which can become the subject of a
stipulation.
(1) Let no one be surprised that every species of property which We have placed
under the head of money can be exacted; for although in the books of the
ancient jurists this action was only mentioned with reference to coin, still,
not only could money be collected by means of it, but also all property which
was susceptible of being weighed, counted, or measured, was included. It is
possible for every kind of property to be converted into money; since if a
certain house, or a certain field, or a certain slave, or anything else was
mentioned in the agreement for payment, what difference is there between these
possessions and money itself?
In order, however, to satisfy the subtle distinctions of persons who do not
desire the sense but the empty sounds of names to be considered, everything
shall be embraced in an action of this description, just as if the contract has
been made for the payment of money itself; for the old jurisconsults included
all kinds of property under the name of money, and this term is not only
frequently met with in the treatises of legal authors, but also in other
ancient jurisprudence.
(2) So far as the customs which money-brokers and other business men have
constantly observed are concerned, they are hereby sanctioned, and shall remain
in full force as observed up to this time.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof March, after the fifth Consulate of
Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
3. The Same to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
It is necessary that the Epistle of the Divine Hadrian, which treats of the
division of liability between mandators and trustees, should also apply to
those who have conjointly agreed to pay money for others; as the rule of equity
ought, by no means, to exclude different forms of the same action.
Given on the Kalendsof November, after the fifth Consulate of Lampadius and
Orestes, 531.
TITLE XIX. CONCERNING PROOFS.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Faustinus.
As a creditor who demands money, which he says he has loaned, is compelled to
prove his claim, so, also, a debtor who alleges that he has discharged his
obligations must furnish evidence of the fact.
Given on the day before the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Dexter,
Consul for the second time, and Priscus, 197.
2. The Emperor Antoninus to Aulizanus.
Institute proceedings in accordance with law to recover the land which you say
is yours, for the-party in possession is not required to
prove that it belongs to him; and if you do not prove your claim, the ownership
of the same will remain with him.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of
Laetus and Cerealis, 216.
3. The Emperor Alexander to Lsena and Lupus.
You should not be sued for a debt of the colleague of your grandfather, if you
can prove that the said colleague was solvent at the time when he withdrew from
office.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of Pompeianus
and Pelignus, 232.
4. The Same to Vitus.
The ownership of property must not only be established by the bill of sale, but
also by all other lawful evidence.
Given on the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of Alexander, Consul for
the third time, and Dio, 230.
5. The Emperor Philip, and the Csesar Philip, to Sertorius.
Private papers, that is to say, instruments executed in the presence of
witnesses, or notes, if they are not supported by other testimony, are not
alone sufficient as evidence.
Given on the seventh of the Idesof April, during the Consulate of Philip and
Titian, 246.
6. The Same, and the C&sars, to Romulus.
It has been frequently stated in rescripts that accounts of a deceased person
found among his effects will not alone be sufficient to prove that a sum of
money was due to him.
The rule of law is the same where the deceased stated in his last will that he
was entitled to a sum of money, or certain other property.
Given on the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Philip and Titian, 246.
Extract from Novel 48, Chapter I. Latin Text.
This rule is especially applicable where the testator was not sworn; otherwise
the heirs will be required to comply with his will, or be prevented from
enjoying the legacies bequeathed to them, but no loss shall result to the
creditors on this account.
7. The Emperor Gallienus to Sabinus.
A pernicious example is offered where faith is given to a private memorandum;
for anyone can, by a note of his own, constitute another his debtor. Therefore,
neither the Treasury, nor any other person whosoever should introduce private
memoranda as evidence of a debt.
Given on the third of the Nonesof March, during the Consulate of Gallienus,
Consul for the seventh time, and Sabinillus, 267.
8. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Publicius and
Optatus.
You apprehend in vain that proof will be required from the defendant in the
case.
Given the thirteenth of the Kalendsof ... during the Consulate of Bassus and
Quintian, 289.
9. The Same, and the Cassars, to Marciana.
As you allege that you are less than twenty-five years old, you should appear
before the Governor of the province and prove your age.
Given on the Idesof April, during the Consulate of the abovementioned Emperors,
293.
10. The Same, and the C&sars, to Isidor.
Neither the circumstances attending your birth (even though you can prove that
you are freeborn), nor the offices which you allege you have held, are
sufficient evidence that your daughter was born free; for there is nothing
which prevents you from being freeborn, and her from being a slave.
Given on the eighteenth of the Kalendsof May, during the abovementioned
Consulate, 293.
11. The Same, and the Csssars, to Antonia.
If you are confident that you can show that the heir appointed by your paternal
aunt is not entitled to the estate, on account of some defect in the will, or
for any other reason, you can institute proceedings with reference to the
estate before the Governor of the province.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof May, at Heraclea, during the Consulate of
the Caesars, 294.
12. The Same, and the Csesars, to Chronia.
Nothing is accomplished by means of written instruments, as they are merely
evidence of what has been done, and you must establish, by such evidence as you
can produce, that the purchase was made by your father, and that he was placed
in possession of the property, and paid the price of the same.
Given on the fifth of the Nonesof October, during the Consulate of the Caesars,
299.
13. The Same, and the Csesars, to Justin.
Blood relationship is not established by letters, but by the evidence of birth,
or the ceremony of adoption; and where for the purpose of dividing an estate an
arbiter is demanded by a female slave, against an absent person, whom she
alleges is her brother, this does not affect the truth of the matter.
Therefore, if you are confident that you can prove that you have sent a letter
to the said female slave, as your sister, or if it is shown that an arbiter was
demanded for her, as for a co-heir, in a case in partition, the question of
brotherhood cannot be disposed of in this way.
Given on the Kalendsof December, during the above-mentioned Consulate, 299.
14. The Same, and the Csesars, to Munitiamts.
It is not by mere assertions, nor by a false statement (even though both
parties may agree to it), but by conception during lawful marriage, or by the
formalities of adoption, that persons can legally be shown to be the sons of
their alleged father. Hence, if you are confident that you can establish that
the party against whom you have filed your petition is the son of someone else,
prove either by yourself or by an attorney that his statement is false.
Given on the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the above-mentioned
Emperors, 299.
15. The Same, and the Csesars, to Antony.
The violence of him who contends that he is the master will in no way avail in
placing the burden of proof of his freedom upon the slave. Therefore, when you
acknowledge that you have fled from the house of Sever us, and assert that you
were in the first place detained by him unjustly and by force, inquiry should
be made whether you are in possession of your freedom without having been
guilty of fraud; for in this way it will be determined which of you should
sustain the burden of proof.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof January, during the abovementioned
Consulate, 299.
16. The Same Emperors and Cassars to Philippa and Sebastiana.
If you are in possession of lands which your emancipated brothers have brought
suit to recover, alleging that they were given to them by your common father,
the necessity of proving this rests upon them. If they had possession of the
said lands on the ground that they had been given to them by your father, and
you, having been appointed the co-heirs of your father, demand that they prove
that your claim is without foundation, in a controversy of this kind the
parties will be compelled to show upon what their title to ownership is based.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof February, during the abovementioned
Consulate, 299.
17. The Same, and the Csssars, to Paulina.
In order to prove that you are freeborn, it is necessary for you to show that
your mother had obtained her freedom, and that you were born afterwards; for
the fact that no question was raised as to the condition of your brothers will
not, In any way, contribute to your defence.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof February, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors, 299.
18. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Violantilla.You asserted in your petition
that the person whom you mentioned caused to be inserted, without your
knowledge, that you had given
him the land in question; and if what you have stated is true, the said land
cannot belong to him by the title of a donation. Wherefore, having gone before
a competent judge, you must prove that your adversary, against your consent,
contrived to have inserted in the will that you had transferred this land to
him, so that, in accordance with the terms of Our Rescript, you can obtain a
decision in your favor.
19. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Menander.
A dilatory exception shall be pleaded in the beginning of an action, and the
plaintiff must afterwards establish the proof of his allegations.
Given at Nicomedia, on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof April, during the
Consulate of the Csesars, 300.
Extract from Novel 90, Chapter IV. Latin Text.
A litigant who has produced witnesses once, twice, or three times, and has
discussed their evidence, or has heard it discussed by his adversary, and, by
this means, learned what has been testified to, shall not have permission to
call new witnesses, even under Our order. If, however, he has not done this, he
should be allowed to produce witnesses a fourth time, after having been sworn
that he did not suppress or dictate any of the evidence, and that none of his
advocates, or anyone acting in his behalf, has done so; and that he has not,
either through fraud, evil intent, or artifice, demanded that a fourth
production of witnesses be made.
20. The Same, and the Csesars, to Phromina.
If Eutychia, after having suppressed a document evidencing her purchase,
demands her freedom from the condition of slavery in which she is, as the
burden of proof rests upon the claimant, if her suppression of the document is
detected, it will be of no advantage to her; for if she is claimed as a slave,
it will not be necessary to furnish evidence of her purchase, but it will be
sufficient to prove the theft of the bill of sale.
Given at Nicomedia, on the fourth of the Nonesof December, during the Consulate
of the Caesars, 300.
21. The Same, and the Csesars, to Crispins.
Those who steal documents belonging to others, upon which the proof of
ownership depends, can under no circumstances make use of them; as they would
be of no advantage to one who is not mentioned in them, but only to him who is
designated therein. Therefore, as it is not forbidden to offer other evidence,
establish by legal means that the ownership of the lands in dispute belongs to
you; for he wha claims property from a purchaser, alleging that it was bought
with his money, is not allowed to prove it. If a fact of this kind should be
established, it will, nevertheless, contribute nothing to the validity of his
claim.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof December, during the Consulate of the Caesars,
303.
22. The Same, and the Csesars, to Agatkoclea.
It is not sufficient proof of the servitude of Glyco to show that his mother
and his brother have been slaves, for the connivance of freeborn persons cannot
prejudice their relatives; nor is one of several slaves born of the same mother
prohibited from obtaining his freedom.
Given on the ninth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
23. The Same, and the Csesars, to Menelaus.
A plaintiff who alleges that he cannot establish his claim does not compel the
defendant to prove the contrary; for, in accordance with the nature of things,
the denial of a fact is no evidence.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
Csesars, 304.
24. The Emperors Valens, Gratian, and Valentinian to Antony, Praetorian
Prefect.
We order all those who allege that papers produced in court are not genuine
shall be detained as forgers, and prosecuted for that crime, unless they prove
that their assertions are true.
Given on the day before the Idesof January, during the Consulate of Valens,
Consul for the fifth time, and Valentinian, 606.
25. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Florus, Prsstorian
Prefect.
All accusers are hereby notified that they cannot bring a criminal charge for
anything which has been established by reliable witnesses; or clearly proved by
documentary evidence; or shown to be true by undoubted testimony clearer than
light.
TITLE XX.
CONCERNING WITNESSES.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Carpus.
If a controversy arises with reference to your being freeborn, defend your case
by documentary evidence and arguments if you can do so; for witnesses alone are
not sufficient to establish proof of free birth.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and ^lianus, 224.
2. The Emperors Valerius and Gallienus to Rosa.
The testimony of members of a household is also rejected by the Civil Law.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof September, under the Consulate of Valerian,
Consul for the third time, and Gallienus, Consul for the second time, 256.
3. The Emperors Carus, Carinus, and Numerian to Valerius.
It is certain that a case which is only proved by witnesses, and is not
supported by any other lawful evidence, is of no force or effect.
Given on the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of Carua and Carinus,
283.
4. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Candidus.
In order to ascertain the truth, witnesses must be produced who hold in greater
esteem the faith due to justice than the favor and power of those entitled to
the same.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and Aquilinus, 280.
5. The Same, and the Csesars, to Tertullus.
Fathers and children cannot be permitted to give evidence against one another,
even if they are willing to do so.
Given at Nicomedia, on the fourth of the Nonesof December, during the Consulate
of the Caesars, 294.
6. The Same, and the Csesars, to Diogenes and Ingenua.
The demand which you make, namely, that the adverse party shall be compelled to
produce the persons by whom the business was transacted, is entirely too
strong. Therefore, understand that you yourself should introduce your own
evidence in the case, and that your adversaries cannot be obliged to furnish
testimony against themselves.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of the Csesars,
294.
7. The Same, and the Csesars, to Derulonus.
There is no doubt that a slave cannot be subjected to torture for or against
his master, but he can be put to the question for some act of his own.
Given at Nicomedia, on the Kalendsof November, under the Consulate of the
Csesars, 294.
8. The Emperor Constantine to Julian, Governor.
We have already directed that witnesses should testify after having been sworn,
and that the preference should be given to those of honorable reputation.
(1) In like manner, We have ordered that no judge shall in any case readily
accept the testimony of only one witness; and now We plainly order that the
evidence of only one witness shall not be taken, even though he should be
distinguished by senatorial rank.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of Optatus
and Paulinus, 334.
9. The Emperors Valens, Gratian, and Valentinian to Gracchus, Urban Prefect.
The laws deprive everyone of the power to testify in his own case.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of Valens,
Consul for the fifth time, and Valentinian Junior, 376.
10. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Csecilianus, Urban Prefect.
Witnesses called to give evidence in the cases of others must be free, if they
are not said to be implicated in the crime, and confidence in their knowledge
shall be required of them; and the judge, in the production of the necessary
persons, that is to say, of good witnesses, must not fail to direct that their
proper expenses be paid by the accuser, or by the others by whom they were
summoned, when they come to court.
The same rule applies when witnesses are produced by either side in a pecuniary
case.
Given at Ravenna, on the twelfth of the Kalendsof February, during the
Consulate of Honorius, Consul for the eighth time, and Theodosius, Consul for
the fourth time, 409.
Extract from Novel 90, Chapter VI. Latin Text.
If a witness, when introduced, is said to be a slave, and he desires to
testify, but alleges that he is free, the question of his status must first be
determined, and if it should appear after investigation that he is a slave, his
evidence shall be rejected. Where, however, he says that he is a freedman, he
must produce the document of his manumission before he testifies, unless he is
willing to make oath that the evidence is elsewhere; and, if this is done, his
testimony should be taken down, and if he does not produce the instrument
showing his manumission, it shall be rejected. But if the witness is declared
to be unacceptable on account of a criminal action pending between the parties,
he shall not be heard before the said action has been decided. But when he is
considered as prejudiced on account of some pecuniary litigation in which he is
involved, or for some other reason, his evidence shall be taken, and the
questions of this kind which arise shall be reserved for argument.
11. The Same to Georgia.
We forbid freedmen, under a penalty, from giving unlawful and dishonorable
testimony against their patrons, and as they must not voluntarily dare to give
such testimony, so, if summoned as witnesses, they cannot be compelled to
appear in court for that purpose.
Given at Ravenna, on the fourth of the Idesof August, during the Consulate of
Marinianus and Asclepiodotus, 243.
12. The Emperor Zeno to Arcadius, Prsstorian Prefect.
We order that no one who has appeared before any judge (even though he may not
be under his jurisdiction) for the purpose of giving testimony, can claim
exemption on the ground of being in the army, or plead any other exception for
the purpose of evading the action of the judge, which is demanded either by
dishonorable evidence, or the nature of the case; but that all those who
testify in civil actions shall, as it were, be deprived of their privileges of
offering an exception in court, and having been stripped of its protection,
shall
be brought privately before the judge, in order that they may not apprehend
that what they may say may offend his ears.
All magistrates (as has frequently been stated) without being prevented by any
exception, are authorized to punish witnesses whose testimony seems to be
either tainted with falsehood or fraud, in accordance with the nature of the
offence.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of Decius and
Longinus, 486.
13. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Prsetorian Prefect.
If anyone should have made use of witnesses, and- the same ones are introduced
against him in another action, he shall not be permitted to exclude them,
unless he can show that enmity has subsequently arisen between him and them, on
account of which the laws direct that witnesses shall be rejected; and under
such circumstances he should not be deprived of the power to contradict their
testimony by means of their own statements. If, however, he should show by
undoubted evidence that they have been corrupted either by the gift or the
promise of money, We order that he shall have the right to prosecute them.
Given on the seventh of the Kalendsof June, during the second Consulate of Our
Lord Justinian, 528.
14. The Same, to Menna, Prsetorian Prefect.
With a view to curtailing as much as possible the ease with which witnesses are
obtained, by means of whom many violations of the truth are perpetrated, We
order all those who state that they have contracted debts in writing shall not
be heard, if they say that they have paid all, or a portion of the
indebtedness, without having obtained a written discharge of the same; and if
they attempt to produce witnesses of low character, or who perhaps have been
bought, to prove a payment of this kind, no attention shall be paid to them,
unless five respectable witnesses, who are citizens of the highest reputation,
and were present at the payment of the money, state under oath that the debt
was paid in their presence; so that everyone may know that it has been decided
that persons cannot make payment of a debt either wholly or in part, unless
they have the fact committed to writing, or can prove it by the above-mentioned
oral testimony. It is, however, but reasonable to except from the provisions of
the present law those who have already paid a debt, or a portion of the same.
But when payment has been evidenced by a written instrument, and it has been
destroyed by accident, as that of fire, shipwreck, or some other mis- -fortune,
then those who have sustained the loss shall be permitted to show the cause,
and prove the payment by witnesses, and in this way avoid the consequences of
the loss by establishing the destruction of the instrument.
Given on the Kalendsof June, during the Second Consulate of Our Lord Justinian,
528.
Extract from Novel 90, Chapter II. Latin Text.
Witnesses shall be summoned as in the case of wills, and not appear by accident
as mere passersby. The same rule will apply if, being called after payment was
made, they heard the acknowledgment of the creditor that the money due to him
had been received.
15. The Same to Julian, Prsetorian Prefect.
If anyone, in accordance with Our laws, in a pecuniary case desires to call
witnesses who are unwilling, and they voluntarily consent to give security that
they will be present, this can be done. If, however, they refuse to do so, We
order that they shall not be imprisoned, but they shall be bound by oath to
appear; for if those who have produced them think that their testimony should
be believed, when they are sworn in the case, they should have still more faith
that the presence of the witnesses will be secured by their oath.
But, as witnesses should not, under such circumstances, be compelled to leave
their homes and submit to inconvenience for the benefit of others, We order
that judges shall not compel them to be present for more than fifteen days
after they have been summoned, and that they shall provide that the case in
which the witnesses appear to be necessary shall be heard within that time, and
when one of the parties to the suit is absent, and, after having been notified
by the bailiffs, has refused to appear, absolute permission is granted to
judges to take the evidence of his witnesses as well as that of those of the
other party who is present.
Moreover, the said term of fifteen days having expired, the witnesses shall be
permitted by the judge to leave, and he shall have no authority to recall them
after they have once departed. We also order that if the judge was to blame for
not having the testimony given, he shall be forced to indemnify the injured
party out of his own property for any damage which he may have sustained.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Lampadius
and Orestes, 530.
Extract from Novel 90, Chapter II. Latin Text.
When anyone has been wrongfully injured by another, or has sustained damage in
some other way, or suffered a loss at his hands, and wishes to produce
witnesses in court and publish their testimony, his adversary shall be notified
by the judge, and the latter shall hear the evidence in his presence. If,
however, he should refuse to appear, the judge can hear the witnesses even in
his absence, and their testimony will have as much weight as if it had been
taken in his presence; nor can he oppose this on the ground that evidence was
introduced by only one of the parties to the suit.
16. The Same to Julian, Prsstorian Prefect.
Where witnesses were produced before judges appointed for the purpose of
compromise, it was doubted whether the party who called them could make use of
their testimony in court, or whether he should
not be heard. In consequence of this, We order that where anything has been
decided with reference to a compromise in cases of this kind, it shall stand;
but if nothing has been agreed upon, and the witnesses are living, he against
whom they have testified, and who refuses to accept their evidence, shall be
permitted to have them called a second time, and this shall not be opposed on
the ground that they have already given their testimony. If, however, he should
refuse to accept it, it shall be received as already given, but he can
contradict it by all the legal means which he is entitled to use. But when all
the witnesses are dead, he will then be required to accept any of their
evidence which has been committed to writing. If, however, some of them should
be dead, and some living, the said litigant will, so far as the testimony of
those who are living is concerned, have a right to accept their statements, or
have the witnesses recalled. With reference to such as are dead, their evidence
should not be rejected; but he can, as We have previously stated, avail himself
of every legal resource to contradict the witnesses and their testimony.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Lampadius
and Orestes, 531.
TITLE XXI.
CONCERNING THE CONFIDENCE TO BE REPOSED IN WRITTEN INSTRUMENTS, AND THEIR Loss,
AND WHEN RECEIPTS AND COUNTER-RECEIPTS SHOULD BE GIVEN, AND CONCERNING WHAT
THINGS CAN BE DONE WITHOUT THEIR BEING COMMITTED TO WRITING.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Marchia.
If you prove that your debtors owe you money for some reason or other, after
you have applied to the Governor of the province, he will compel them to make
payment, nor will a loss of the written evidence of the debt prejudice your
rights, if it should clearly appear by competent evidence that the parties in
question are indebted to you.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof September, during the Consulate of Antoninus,
Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
2. The Emperor Alexander to Mabilianus.
If you should make use of a written document on account of which another person
has already been accused and convicted of forgery, and it should appear that he
from whom you demand money is ready to accuse you of the same offence, and take
the risk of the penalty imposed by the Cornelian Law, even though the person
who was convicted has not appealed from the sentence, you, who have not yet
been accused of crime, cannot take an appeal.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate' of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and ^Elianus, 224.
3. The Same to JElianus.
If your adversary has stated to the Governor of the province that he will not
make use of the document which he produced, as he doubts whether it is genuine
or not, you should not be apprehensive that the matter will again be brought up
on account of the document, which it appears from his own statement was not
genuine.
Given on the third of the Nonesof December, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and ^lianus, 224.
4. The Emperor Gordian to Martian.
If, on account of the loss of your papers, you are unable to prove that the
money was paid to the public collector, an examination of the accounts of the
Treasury will establish the truth of the allegation.
Given on the second of the Idesof February, during the Consulate of Gordian and
Aviola, 240.
5. The Same to the Soldiers Priscus and Marcus.
Where the evidences of a debt have been consumed by fire, while it is unjust
for debtors to refuse payment of the sums which they owe, still, too ready
belief should not always be accorded to persons who complain of such an
accident. Therefore, you should understand that where the instruments are
missing, you ought to prove the truth of the statement in your petition by
other evidence.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of Sabinus,
Consul for the second time, and Venustus, 241.
6. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Lucidus.
It is a well-established rule of law that where the certificate of your birth
is lost, your civil condition is not affected thereby.
Given at Nicomedia, on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof February, during the
Consulate of Maximus, Consul for the second time, and Aquilinus, 286.
7. The Same, and the Csesars, to Zinima.
If you have been honorably discharged from the army, even though, as you
allege, the papers showing this fact have been lost, still, if the truth can be
established by other clear evidence, there is no doubt that you will be
entitled to enjoy the privileges of veterans.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and Aquilinus, 286.
8. The Same, and the Csesars, to Alexander.
If it should be proved that the land in question belongs to you, the judge will
provide that no prejudice shall result to your ownership through any act of the
usufructuary growing out of the loss of your muniments of title.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of
Diocletian, Consul for the second time, and Maximian, 287.
9. The Same, and the Csesars, to Aristenetus.
Partition of property, when legally made, shall not be considered void for the
reason that no instruments have been drawn up with reference to it.
Given on the seventh of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors.
10. The Same, and the Csesars, to Victorinus.
As a sale when lawfully concluded remains valid even if no documents evidencing
it have been executed, so it has been decided that where any have been executed
and subsequently lost, the validity of the sale will not be affected.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof November, during the abovementioned
Consulate.
11. The Same, and the Csesars, to Theagena.
Emancipation having taken place although the documents are no longer in
existence, still, if it can be proved either by reliable witnesses or by
unquestionable documentary evidence that the emancipation actually occurred,
the truth cannot be affected by the loss of the
papers.
Given on the third of the Idesof November, during the abovementioned Consulate.
12. The Same, and the Csesars, to Dionysia.
Where you have been placed in possession of a tract of land by means of a
donation, you are none the less entitled to it because no written instrument is
said to have been executed for the purpose of conveying the title.
Given at Nicomedia, on the Idesof December, under the abovementioned Consulate.
13. The Same, and the Csesars, to Leontius.
The statement that documents have been lost, made in the presence of persons
who are ignorant of the fact, is of no benefit for the establishment of the
truth.
Given at Nicomedia, on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the
above-mentioned Consulate.
14. The Same, and the Csesars, to Severus, Count of the Spains.
Different documents which conflict with one another, and are produced by one
and the same person, can have no effect whatever.
Given on the fourth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of the Caesars.
15. The Emperor Constantine to the People.
In the administration of justice, documentary evidence has the same force as
the depositions of witnesses.
Given at Rome, during the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Gallicanus
and Bassus, 317.
16. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Prsstorian Prefect.
We order that contracts of sale, exchange, or donation, registry of which is
not necessary, gifts of earnest money, or those made for any other reason which
are required to be in writing, and also such as relate to compromise, shall not
have any force unless evidenced by written documents and confirmed by the
signature of those who execute them; and if they have been drawn up by a
notary, they must be completed by him, and finally acknowledged by the parties
interested, so that, where these formalities have not been complied with, no
one will be permitted to claim any right for himself growing out of a contract
or compromise based upon a written memorandum (even though it be signed by one
or both the parties), whether it has not yet been carried out, or is complete;
in order that in transactions of this kind it cannot be said that the vendor
was required to sell the property at a certain price; or that the contract of
sale was perfected; or that the purchaser should be compelled to make payment.
We decree that this rule shall apply to instruments of this description, not
only where they have already been reduced to writing, but also where they have
not yet been completed; unless where a compromise has been made, or a judgment
rendered, under which circumstances they cannot be revoked.
Only those documents are excepted from this rule which have already been drawn
up and published, for We do not include these in the present law, but permit
them to be subject to those formerly enacted. We also add that, hereafter,
where earnest money has been given for the purpose of making a sale of any kind
of property whatsoever, whether the contract is in writing or not, even though
it may not have been expressly stated what disposition must be made of the
earnest money in case the contract was not carried out, he who promised to sell
the property, and then refuses to do so, shall be compelled to pay double the
amount of the deposit; and he who agreed to purchase it, and refuses to do so,
shall lose the sum which was given, and shall be denied the right to recover
it.
17. The Same to Menna, Praetorian Prefect.
We order that judges, either in this Renowned City or in the provinces, in
accordance with what We have already decreed, where witnesses reside in other
places, may (if they think proper to do so) send the litigants or their
attorneys there, in order that the deposi tions of the witnesses may be taken
in the presence of one or the othei of the parties to the suit, and returned to
them.
We also wish these rules to be observed in the case of those who, where
documents have been introduced, demand that they be proved; so that if they ask
for it, they may be permitted to have testimony taken elsewhere. If the judge
should find this request to be just, he can issue a decree to that effect, so
that afterwards, whether the document is proved or not, the matter may be sent
back to the former judge.
Given on the eighth of the Idesof April, during the Consulate of Decius, 529.
Extract from Novel 90, Chaper V. Latin Text.
This proceeding may be demanded either before a judge or the defender of a
city, and can take place from one province to another, or from one city to
another, or from a city to a province; but the rule is only applicable to civil
actions, for in criminal cases witnesses must be produced in court and
subjected to torture, if the case requires it.
18. The Same to Demosthenes, Praetorian Prefect.
Where several persons have received receipts for rent or interest, and when any
doubt arises with reference to them, the rights of their creditors become
uncertain when the parties deny that they have these receipts; as where serfs
dispute the ownership of their master, and unjustly claim their own freedom, or
debtors, desiring to plead temporary prescription against their creditors, make
similar denials. With a view to disposing of this difficulty, We order that if,
in the above-mentioned cases or in any other private ones resembling them,
anyone who gives a receipt should desire to have a copy with the signature of
the person who received it, he will be entitled to do so, or to receive a
counter-receipt; so that, if permission is granted him, he who obtained the
receipt will be obliged to give a counter-receipt in return; and if the
creditor neglects to do this, the rights of the iperson who did not receive the
counter-receipt will not be prejudiced; for it is contrary to the rules of
equity that what has been introduced for the benefit of anyone should redound
to his injury.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof October, during the fifth Consulate of
Decius.
19. The Same to Julian, Prsetorian Prefect.
It is clear that the comparison of notes and other instruments, which are not
publicly executed, very frequently gives occasion to accusations of forgery,
both in lawsuits and in contracts. Therefore, We order that no comparison of
private papers shall be made, unless they bear the signature of three
witnesses, and that, before they are accepted, either all three of them, or at
least two, must acknowledge the genuineness of their signatures before a
comparison of the instruments takes place, as only under such circumstances is
a comparison of handwriting allowed; for, otherwise, We forbid such a
comparison to be made, even though someone may produce a written instrument
against himself; except where a comparison is necessary in the case of
instruments originating in court, or in public documents, or in papers of the
kind which We have mentioned.
We do not allow any comparison to be made, unless it has previously been stated
under oath by the persons who are to make it that they do so without being
induced by the hope of gain, or by enmity,
or by favor.
We order that this rule shall be observed in all the Imperial bureaus as well
as in the tribunal of the eminent prefecture; in thai
of the commander of the army; and in those of all other judges who have been
appointed in Our dominions. These provisions shall be complied with hereafter,
for to annul any comparisons which have already been made would not be without
danger.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of
Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
Extract from Novel 49, Chapter II. Latin Text.
You very properly ask that an examination of the instruments which your
adversary produces and makes use of be permitted; and any document which is
produced in the Public Archives is also subject to public evidence of this
kind.
Extract from Novel 73, Chapters Vill, and IX. Latin Text.
If, however, the contract was made in a city, and was for more than one pound
of gold, it must, by all means, be proved by comparison of handwriting, for it
alone is not sufficient evidence.
20. The Same to Julian, Prsetorian Prefect.
When anyone introduces a written instrument or some other paper, and proves its
genuineness, and afterwards the person against whom the said paper or
instrument was produced attempts to show that it was forged, in order that
doubt may no longer exist as to whether he who introduced the paper can be
compelled to again establish its genuineness, or whether the former evidence
was sufficient, We order that when such a case occurs, he who asks that the
paper be produced a second time must first make oath that he thinks he can
prove that it is forged, to enable a petition of this kind to be considered.
But what course must be pursued if he should make a demand of this kind, being
well aware that the document was lost or burned, or had been destroyed in some
other way, and he pretended to require its production, knowing the difficulty
of doing this? After the plaintiff or the claimant has been sworn, and the
accusation brought before a competent judge, the necessity will then be imposed
upon the person who introduced the document.in question to introduce it again
in court, in order that the accusation of forgery may be investigated. If,
however, he should say that it is not possible for him to produce the paper,
because he has been deprived of it by accident, he must then swear that he has
not the said paper in his possession; that he has not given it to anyone; that
it is not held by another with his consent; and that he has not been guilty of
fraud to prevent its appearance, but, as the said document has actually been
lost without his fault, its production by him is impossible.
If he takes an oath of this kind he shall be excused from the necessity of
producing the paper, but if he refuses to take it, then the instrument shall be
considered forged, and of no effect, so far as the party against whom it was
produced is concerned, but shall be absolutely void. We do not, however, desire
to subject to further
punishment persons who, under such circumstances, refuse to be sworn, as there
are many who, influenced by too great reverence, are not even willing to swear
to something which is true.
We grant the same opportunity to the other party until the action has been
decided in court, for if it has already been terminated, and has not been
suspended by appeal, it cannot be expected to be revived by means of the usual
procedure; as it is sufficiently hard to authorize a complaint of this kind,
lest cases may be protracted indefinitely, and matters which have already been
settled by this means, may again be opened, and the opposite of what We have
intended occur.1
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Lampadius
and Orestes, 530.
1 No law of evidence, as we understand it, was known to the Roman jurists. The
greatest latitude of statement was allowed; hearsay was admissible; proof was
only regarded as conclusive where a fact was established by the testimony of
two credible witnesses, or where a public document of indisputable authority
was introduced. Presumptions were, under certain circumstances, considered to
have much more effect than in our practice, especially when not confuted by the
adverse party. Of legal presumptions the court took judicial notice.
Presumptions, which were often accepted in lieu of testimony, were of several
kinds. The most important were the priesumptiones juris et de jure,which, being
arbitrary legal rules, were absolute, and could not be disputed. Next came the
prsesumptiones juris,by which something was held to be established as long as
no contradictory evidence was adduced. The last, and those having least weight,
were the priesumptiones facti,or inferences of fact, which arose from time to
time during the proceedings, and whose application or rejection was entirely
dependent upon the will of the court.
Competency to testify was, in some respects, governed by the same rule that
prevails at the present time; in addition to this, however, minors under the
age of fourteen years, anyone accused of perjury, or who had been adjudged a
spendthrift, a convict, a person publicly denounced as infamous, and an
adulteress, were declared to be absolutely incompetent. A particeps criminis,as
being quasiinfamous, was included in this category. All who had an interest in
the matter to be decided were excluded, in accordance with the maxim: "Nullus
idoneus testis in re sua intelligitur;"hence neither party to an action could
give evidence, for fear his prospective benefit might prevail over his sense of
integrity, unless the oath was tendered by his opponent, who was then held to
have waived his privilege; and the general legal principle was considered no
longer applicable to that particular case. This oath, to have any effect, must
be demanded either by the adversary or the judge.
Consanguinity was also a bar, as well as the close intimacy of friends ("Amicos
appellare debemus non levi notitia, conjunctos"); a client could not testify
against his patron, nor a slave against his master, nor an attorney against his
constituent or principal, and deadly enemies were reciprocally excluded. The
above-mentioned persons were denied the right because of the influence, or, in
some cases, the duress, which was presumed to exist. The pecuniary
circumstances of a proposed witness were carefully investigated, and if he were
found to be very poor, his testimony, if not rejected, was considered to be
practically worthless, on" account of his supposed liability to corruption.
This inequitable rule was subsequently incorporated with all its rigor into the
legal compilations of mediaeval Europe. Torture could only be employed against
slaves in civil actions having reference to the descent and distribution of
estates.
The onus probandirested on the plaintiff, who was obliged to establish his
claim by affirmative evidence, as prescribed by the rule, "Ei incumbit probatio
qui dicit, non qui negat,"a doctrine which has been adopted by all modern
systems of

EXPRESSED
IN WORDS.

stated in writing.
jurisprudence. The defendant was likewise required to prove any allegations set
out by him in his exceptio,or other pleadings.
The number of witnesses testifying to the same fact was held to be entitled to
greater consideration than their character as individual members of the
community. More attention was paid to the testimony of a man than to that of a
woman; and the power of rank and wealth over comparative obscurity and
indigence was, with manifest injustice, recognized by the Roman tribunals.
There was, before the reign of Justinian, no legal process by means of which
witnesses could be compelled to appear, except in criminal cases, hence their
attendance was purely voluntary.
Greater weight attached to all public records and properly authenticated
documents duly executed by, or in the presence of the officials charged with
that duty, than to others of any description; and of these which included
instruments attested by notaries, courts were required to take judicial notice.
A last will was considered a public document by the Roman jurisconsults.
A private instrument, to be legal, was required to be sworn to and signed by
three witnesses. If they, or any of them, were dead, their signatures could be
proved by their comparison with others of whose authenticity there could be no
doubt. A personal document of such great age that the witnesses thereto, in the
course of nature, must be presumed to be no longer living, might be accepted,
if its genuineness could not otherwise be proved. Where a paper was lost or
destroyed, no evidence of its contents could be given, unless its absence, or
non-existence, was satisfactorily established under oath. If a large number of
witnesses testified to the same fact, it was in the discretion of the judge to
exclude as many of them as he desired. When the plaintiff swore to the damages
to which he alleged he was entitled, the court could either accept his
statement, or reduce the amount demanded. If he failed to prove his claim a non
liquet,equivalent to a non-suit, was entered.
Among the Romans, documentary evidence was, under all circumstances, considered
much preferable to oral evidence, on account of the relative uncertainty of the
latter, and, as a rule, could not be contradicted by it. "Testes cum de fide
tabularum nihil dicitur, adversus scripturam interrogari non possunt."
Hypothecary and pignorative contracts, promissory notes, and papers known to be
the handwriting of parties to an action at law, occupied an inferior place, and
were not entitled to the credit or importance enjoyed by those confirmed by
public authority; and, where they conflicted with the latter, were required to
be substantiated by indisputable and conclusive verbal testimony.
Copies of documents were admissible if their accuracy could be satisfactorily
established, provided proof 'was adduced that the originals were not available.
Three sworn witnesses were required for the attestation of conveyances of land,
agreements, and similar instruments. A person was estopped by his own written
deed, no matter what its character, provided its execution had been accompanied
with the usual formalities, whether they involved merely an appearance and
verbal acknowledgment before a public official, or the drawing up, sealing, and
attestation of some document in the manner prescribed by law; and no testimony
could be introduced to question its validity, unless it was shown that the
instrument had been procured through fraudulent representations, or extorted by
violence. Comparison of handwriting was permitted when well-founded suspicion
arose as to the

Fictitious instruments, as, for instance, those which state that not the
husband, but the wife, made the purchase, cannot alter the truth; hence the
question of fact should be examined by the judge or the Governor of the
province.

genuineness of the signature of a person who was dead, and witnesses of good
reputation were prepared to establish its authenticity under oath. It was
obligatory upon the plaintiff to furnish the defendant with a complete list of
all the documentary evidence which he expected to introduce to prove his case.
The introduction of depositions was only allowed under circumstances of urgent
necessity, as they were not made under oath and afforded no opportunity for
cross-examination; and no list of interrogatories was submitted by the adverse
party as at the present day. When the testimony of both sides was
unsatisfactory and inconclusive, it was a well-recognized rule that the
defendant was entitled to the benefit of the doubt. No one who had not attained
his majority was qualified to testify in a criminal case. The unsupported
evidence of a single witness was inadmissible to prove any fact.
A marked peculiarity of Roman judicial procedure was that certain oaths might
be taken while the case was being tried, some of which were accepted as
conclusive, so far as the question at issue was concerned. Either party to an
action could tender the juramentum voluntariv/mto the other, who had the right
to tender it back, and" if he did not do so, he was considered to have accepted
it as true. Recourse was had to the juramentum in litem,when it was necessary
to estimate the amount of damages sustained by the loss or destruction of
property which, on this account, could not be produced in court, and the
plaintiff was sworn as to its value. The juramentum necessarium sive
suppletoriumwas administered by a magistrate to a litigant to supply the want
of defective or incomplete evidence, when the request was made to do so, and
the court was satisfied of its expediency.
Evidence of character, whether good or bad, was considered of extreme
importance by the Roman jurisconsults. Contrary to the English rule, proof of
previous misconduct, or the commission of crime could be introduced by the
prosecution, without the question having been brought up by the accused. On the
other hand, former good behavior and repute were always dwelt upon by counsel
as almost conclusive confutation of the guilt of their clients. In making these
statements, great reliance was placed upon the personal knowledge of the life
of the defendant possessed by the court and jury, as was the case in early
trials under the Common Law when the terms juror and testiswere synonymous.
The great antiquity of the rules regulating the competency of witnesses which
were incorporated into Roman jurisprudence is disclosed by an examination of
the old Hindu laws:
"A Minor until Fifteen Years of Age, One single Person, a Woman, a Man of bad
Principles, a Father, or an Enemy, may not be Witnesses."
"He who hath killed a Man, or who is guilty of Theft, of Adultery, or of false
Abuse, or who, enticing a Man to himself, by Treachery or Deceit, deprives him
of Life, and destroys his Effects, or whoever is a Juggler, and is constantly
employed in Games of Dice and Chances, or whoever is a perpetual Wrangler, such
Persons shall not be Witnesses." (Gentoo Code III, Vill.)
"Those must not be admitted who have a pecuniary interest; nor familiar
friends; nor menial servants; nor enemies; nor men formerly perjured; nor
persons grievously diseased; nor those, who have committed heinous offences.
"The king cannot be made a witness; nor cooks, and the like mean artificers;
nor publick dancers and singers; nor a priest of deep learning in scripture;
nor a student in theology; nor an anchoret secluded from all worldly
connexions;

"Nor one wholly dependent; nor one of bad fame; nor one, who follows a cruel
occupation; nor one, who acts openly against the law; nor a decrepit old man;
nor a child; nor one man only, unless he be distinguished for virtue; nor a

"Nor one extremely grieved; nor one intoxicated; nor a madman; nor one
tormented with hunger and thirst; nor one oppressed by fatigue; nor one excited
by lust; nor one inflamed by wrath; nor one who has been convicted of theft."
(Sir Wm. Jones, The Laws of Menu, Page 284.)
In Greece, as at Rome, slaves, either in the capacity of parties litigant or
witnesses, were excluded from court.
"Servum hominem causam orare leges non sinunt. Neque testamonii dictio est:"
(Terence, Phormio II, I.)
"No slaves shall appear as evidence." (Potter, Antiquities of Greece I, XXVI,
Page 193.)
Interested parties were not allowed to testify; hearsay based on the statements
of deceased or absent persons was admitted; and witnesses, after having been
sworn, could not refuse to give their testimony, which was reduced to writing,
"No one« shall be evidence for himself, either in judicial actions, or in
rendering up accounts."
"There shall be no constraint for friends and acquaintances, if contrary to
their wills, to bear witness one against another."
"Eye witnesses shall write down what they know, and read it." (Ibid.,loc. cit.)
The rule fixing the number of witnesses required to establish a fact at Common
Law is as old as Bracton. "Testium numerus si non adjicitur, duo sufficient."
(De Legibus et Consuetudinibus AngliaeV, 359.)
Many of the principles of the Civil Law relating to the nature and introduction
of evidence were adopted by the old English jurists. Anyone who had been
recreant, and in consequence branded with cowardice, was incompetent. "He that
loseth liberum legem,becometh infamous, and can be no witnesse. Or if the
witnesse be an infidell, or of non-sane memory, or not of discretion, or a
partie interested or the like." (Coke, Institutes, I, I, I, 6. b.) As among the
Romans, a defendant accused of a capital crime in England was formerly
considered as practically outside the pale of the law, and hence not entitled
to the aid of an attorney, or to the testimony of witnesses in his behalf.
Unlike the provision of Roman legislation, a single witness may be called in a
legal proceeding in the English or American courts. Infamy is no longer a bar
to a person's capacity to testify, but the credibility of his evidence is left
to the jury. Many of the other ancient rules have been abrogated, among them
those relating to age, sex, parties to the suit, and consanguinity.
The classification of presumptions bears a striking resemblance to that of the
Civil Law. "Many times juries, together with other matter, are much induced by
presumptions; wherefore there be three sorts, viz.: violent, probable, and
light or temerary. Violenta priesumptiois manie times plena probatio;as if one
be runne thorow the bodie with a sword in a house, whereof he instantly dieth,
and a man is seene to come out of that house with a bloody sword, and no other
5. The Same, and the Csesars, to Victor.
If you should sign a false contract of sale, under the impression that it was a
lease you had directed to be drawn up for you, and which the other party did
not sign, but you did in good faith, there is no doubt that neither contract is
valid, as in both instances consent was lacking.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
man was at that time in the house, prsesumptio probabilismoveth little; but
prie-sumptio lasvis sea temerariamoveth not at all."
The various judicial oaths of the Civil Law, juramentum in litem, juramentum
suppletorium,and juramentum voluntarium,were incorporated into the
jurisprudence of Scotland. "The oath in litemis admissible where the
culpability of the defender is inferred by a presumption of law, without any
express delict."
"The oath in supplement is the evidence of one acquainted with the facts, but
subject to great bias. Being only admissible as in supplement of the other
evidence, it must be corroborative of that evidence, in order to raise the
proof from semiplena to plena."
"Reference to oath is not so much a species of evidence as a mode of supplying
the want of evidence, and preventing unjust consequences, ubi non deficit jus
sed probatio.It is accordingly settled that a party has not an absolute right
to call for his opponent's oath; but that the court, in the exercise of its
discretion, may refuse the reference, if they consider that it would not aid
the justice of the case." (Dickson, A Treatise on the Law of Evidence in
Scotland II, IV, I: V, III; VII, I; III, I, XV.)
The rules establishing the disability of witnesses on the ground of sex,
infamy, dependence, and indigenceunder which all were excluded who were not
worth sixteen shillings and eight pencehave been abolished.
The juramentum, voluntarium, juramentum in litem,and the juramentum
suppletoriumconstitute part of the French legal procedure, in which they are
designated respectively, le serment deeisoire, le serment in litem,and le
serment defere d'office. (Code Civil de France,Arts. 1357-1369.)
The first of these can be administered in any kind of controversy, but is only
applicable to personal facts concerning him to whom it is tendered, which facts
must be of such a conclusive character as to at once dispose of the question at
issue, hence the name. The oath cannot be refused even on the ground that it
will have a tendency to incriminate the person directed to take it.
The serment in litemis only admissible when the value of the property cannot be
otherwise estimated. The serment defere d'office,usually administered to one of
the litigants, is only intended as a source of information, when other
testimony is incomplete.
In the French tribunals, all evidence, whether in the first place documentary
or oral, is reduced to writing and then presented to the judge. The prolixity
of witnesses is rather encouraged than restrained; opinion and hearsay, so
rigorously excluded under the Anglo-Saxon practice, are interposed without
objection or remonstrance; examination and cross-examination by attorneys are
not permitted. Questions, when necessary, are asked by the magistrate who
presides over the original judicial investigation, or enquete,and who is
especially designated for that purpose. (VideBodington, An Outline of the
French Law of Evidence, Pages 2, 73, 77, 79.)
Minors under fourteen years of age, insane persons, the blind and deaf, when
the proof of facts demand eyesight or audition, persons directly interested in
the action, ascendants and descendants, husband and wife, and those whose
profession bind them to secrecy, are not permitted to testify before the
Spanish tribunals. (Codigo Civil de Espana,Arts. 1244-1247.)
At present, the English and American rules of evidence probably coincide more
nearly than those of any other branch of jurisprudence.ED.
TITLE XXIII. CONCERNING LOANS FOR USE.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Sciola.
Those things which are destroyed by the exertions of superior force cannot be
at the risk of the persons to whom the property was lent for use; but as you
state that he to whom you lent an ox proposed to assume the risk of future
damage and loss through a threatened incursion of the enemy, the Governor of
the province shall compel him to carry out his agreement, if you can prove that
he promised to indemnify you.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of the same
Emperors.
2. The Same to Aulizanus.
As good faith requires the restitution of a female slave by the person who
received her for temporary service, the result will be that your father-in-law
must show before the Governor of the province why the female slave was
delivered to him, in order that the party against whom you have filed your
petition may be forced to comply with his contract.
Given on the day before the Nonesof November, during the Consulate of the same
Emperors.
3. The Same to Soteria.
With reference to the restoration of the property, which you gave to your
husband to be encumbered in his behalf, you can, after the debt has been paid,
bring the action of loan even against his heirs.
Given on the third of the Idesof April, during the Consulate of the same
Emperors.
4. The Same, and the Ctesars, to Faustina.
The return of a loan cannot properly be refused under the pretext of a debt.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof December, during the same Consulate.
TITLE XXIV. CONCERNING THE ACTION OP PLEDGE.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Demetrius.
What has been obtained by the labor of the female slave, or from the rent of
the house which you state is held in pledge, will disclose the amount of the
indebtedness.
Given on the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of Antoninus, Consul for
the fourth time, and Alexander, 223.
2. The Same to Victorinus.
A creditor who holds land in pledge is required to diminish the amount of the
debt by the value of the crops which he has collected,
or should have collected; and if he injures the land, he will on this account
be liable to the action of pledge.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof December, during the Consulate of Antoninus,
Consul for the fourth time, and Alexander, 223.
3. The Same to Hermius and Maximilla.
The contract to which you refer, under whose terms, if the money due should not
be paid within a certain time, permission is granted to sell the\ land pledged
or hypothecated, does not deprive the debtor of the right to bring the action
on pledge against his creditor.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and JElianus, 224.
4. The Same to Dioscorida.
If the creditor, without his fault, has lost the silver given him in pledge, he
is not required to make it good. If, however, he should be found guilty of
negligence, even though it may not be clearly proved that he lost the silver,
judgment shall be rendered against him for the amount of the interest of the
debtor.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Julian,
Consul for the second time, and Crispinus, 225.
5. The Same to Trophina.
Whatever happens accidentally and cannot be provided against, as, for instance,
an attack by robbers, does not furnish ground for a guarantee in a bona
fideaction, and therefore a creditor is not compelled to be responsible for
property which has been lost in this way; nor will he be barred from bringing
suit to recover the debt, unless it was agreed upon between the contracting
parties that loss of the pledges would release the debtor.
Given on the Idesof April, during the. Consulate of Fuscus and
Dexter, 226.
6. The Emperor Gordian to Julian.
A creditor, who has received lands and houses in pledge or by way of
hypothecation, is required to deduct from the amount of the indebtedness the
damage he caused by cutting down trees, or demolishing buildings; and if
through fraud or negligence he has rendered the property mentioned less
valuable, he will be liable on this ground in the action on pledge, and will be
required to restore everything to the condition in which it was at the time
when the obligation
was contracted.
A creditor, however, is not forbidden to demand any necessary expenses incurred
by him with reference to the property pledged. .
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of
Gordian, Consul for the second time, and Pompeianus, 242.
7. The Emperor Philip, and the Cassar Philip, to Saturninus.If neither blame
nor negligence can be imputed to a creditor, he' will not be responsible for
the loss of pledges; but if such a loss is
54
simulated, and, as you allege, the pledges are still in the possession of the
adverse party, you can institute proceedings against him.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Praesens
and Albinus, 247.
8. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the C&sars, to Georgius.
There is no doubt that the pledge continues to be part of the property of the
debtor, and hence if it is destroyed he must bear the loss. Therefore, as you
state that the articles pledged were placed in warehouses, the result will be
that, according to the general law that pledges are at the risk of the debtor
(if the said warehouses are such as are ordinarily publicly used by others for
the deposit of property), you will undoubtedly be entitled to a personal action
to recover the entire debt.
Given at Milan, on the sixth of the Nonesof May, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
9. The Same, and the Csesars, to Apollodora.
Neither creditors nor their successors can protect themselves by prescription
based upon long time against debtors who demand property which has been
pledged, after having paid the debt in full, or after having tendered, sealed
up, and deposited the money for the creditors who refused to receive it.
Therefore, understand that if you can show that this is the origin of the
possession of the property by your adversary, you can recover it.
Moreover, in order that the creditor may be able to protect himself from the
demand for the pledge, you will be required to prove the indebtedness; or if
you hold the property pledged and claim it, he will be required to do the same
thing; and the release of the pledge will not be difficult for you to obtain,
either by payment of the money, or by tendering and formally depositing it.
Given on the Nonesof May, during the Consulate of the Csesars.
10. The Same Emperors and Caesars to Ammianus.
The nature of the action on pledge shows that the property which has been
encumbered should be returned as soon as the debt has been paid. In accordance
with this rule, if you have pledged certain slaves, you can avail yourself of
the same action; as the creditor cannot, at his will, appropriate the property
of the debtor without an agreement to that effect, or an order of the Governor
authorizing it to be done.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
11. The Same Emperors and Csssars to Heriscus.
An account having been taken of the profits obtained by the creditor from
property which has been pledged to him, and credited upon the debt, and the
balance having been paid, or (if it was the credi-
tor's fault that this was not done), the amount due having been tendered,
sealed up, and deposited, the pledges given as security shall be restored to
the debtor, against whom prescription based upon long time can not be pleaded.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
TITLE XXV.
CONCERNING THE ACTIO INSTITORIA AND THE ACTIO EXERCITORIA.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Hermes.
Your slave, by receiving a sum of money which had been loaned, renders you
liable to the Actio institoria,when you have appointed him to discharge some
duty, or conduct some business, and it is proved that permission was given by
you for him to do this. The action, however, will not lie if it should be
proved that the money was employed for the benefit of your property; but you
will be compelled to make payment by means of the proceeding available for this
purpose.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of the two
Aspers, 213.
2. The Emperor Alexander to Callistus.
Although masters are only liable to the amount of the peculiumof their slaves,
in contracts made by the latter, still, there is no doubt that a master can be
sued for the entire amount where the money has been employed for the benefit of
his property, or the contract was made by the slave as agent, in an affair
which he was appointed to transact.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Alexander,
Consul for the second time, and Marcellus, 227.
3. The Same to Martia.
The Actio institoriawill lie in your favor against the person by whom, as you
allege, a slave has been appointed to take charge of his counting-house, if you
can prove that the money was deposited with the said slave, and not returned,
in the course of the business with which he was entrusted.
Given on the Nonesof May, under the Consulate of Agricola and Clementinus, 331.
4. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csssars, to Antigona.
If a woman should be appointed to command a ship, she will be liable in an
Actio exercitoriafor the contracts of him who appointed her, just as in the
case of an Actio institoria.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
5. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Gaius.
If you are sure you can prove that Domitian directed Demetri-anus to borrow a
certain sum of money from you, you can bring suit against Domitian before a
competent judge in the same way as in an Actio institoria.
Given on the fourth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
6. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Onesima.
He who conforms to the will of the master when he makes a contract with his
slave can legally hold the former responsible for the entire amount by an
action resembling the Actio institoria.
Given on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.



TITLE XXVI.
WHEN BUSINESS is SAID TO HAVE BEEN TRANSACTED WITH ONE WHO is UNDER THE CONTROL
OF ANOTHER, OR WITH REFERENCE TO PECULIUM; OR WHERE SOMETHING HAS BEEN DONE BY
THE ORDER OF ANOTHER; OR WHERE ANYTHING is EMPLOYED FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE
PROPERTY OF THE PERSON IN CONTROL.

1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Mlius.
When a son under paternal control is appointed a guardian or curator, the
action on guardianship, or of voluntary agency, or De peculia,or for money
employed for the benefit of the property of another, should be brought against
the father. Where a son is created a decurion with the consent of his father,
and is afterwards appointed a guardian by magistrates, his father will be
compelled to pay the entire debt, as this liability is understood to be
incurred in the same way as that of other municipal charges.
Given on the seventh of the Idesof November, during the Consulate of Dexter,
Consul for the second time, and Priscus, 197.

2. The Same to Annius.
It has been declared by the interpretation of the Perpetual Edict that where a
contract having reference to property has been made with a son under paternal
control, either with the consent of the latter, or with that of him to whose
authority he was subject, whether the money was to be employed for the benefit
of his own peculiumor for the benefit of the property of his- father, and he
should reject his father's estate, an action can only be brought against him
for the amount that he is able to pay.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of Dexter,
Consul for the second time, and Priscus, 197.

3. The Emperor Antoninus to Artemon.
If you lend money to the slave of Prisca, without his mistress directing this
to be done, or ordering it, or consenting to it, still, if the amount was
legally expended for the benefit of the property of his mistress, suit can be
brought against her on that ground, and you can obtain what appears to be due
to you in accordance with the forms of law.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Lsetus and
Cerealis, 216.

4. The Same to Lucius.
If you have obtained a loan of money under a contract of your father, and by
his order, and you reject his estate, you will have no reason to apprehend that
you will be sued by his creditors.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of Messala
and Sabinus, 215.

5. The Emperor Alexander to Asclepiades.
Nothing prevents sons under paternal control, who are over twenty-five years of
age, and have become sureties for others, from being liable in a proper action
brought against them. If, however, suit is brought against you only to the
amount of your peculium,avail yourself of all the defences to which you are
entitled.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof December, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and ^lianus, 224.

6. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus, and the Cassar Valerian, to Matronus.
If your slave, having borrowed a sum of money without your permission, grants
his creditor a right of habitation, in lieu of interest, your adversary can, on
no legal ground, claim this privilege for himself, as the act of the slave did
not render you liable; and, having entered upon your property, you will be
protected against his violence by the authority of a competent judge.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of ^milianus
and Bassus, 260.

7. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Cassars, to Crescens.
There is no doubt that anyone who has lent a sum of money to a slave belonging
to another will, during the lifetime of the slave and within a year after his
death, be entitled to bring the action De peculioagainst the master of the said
slave; or if the sum was employed for the benefit of the property of the said
master, to bring a praetorian action against him even a year after the death of
the slave. Therefore, if the money has been employed for the benefit of the
master's property, you can sue his heirs for the amount expended for that
purpose. If, however, you are unable to prove that this is the case, the result
will be that, if the slave is still living, you can sue his master
in the action De peculia;or if he is dead, or has been sold or manumitted, and
the year has not expired, you can bring this action against the person having
him in possession.
(1) Where, however, you made a contract with a freeman who transacted the
business of the person whom you mentioned in your petition, and chose him as
your debtor; understand that you have no right of action against his principal,
unless the money was employed for the benefit of the property of the latter, or
he ratified the contract.
Given at Byzantium, on the Nonesof April, under the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors.

8. The Same Emperors and Czesars to Diogenes.
If you have acted as the mandator of your son, or a contract was made with him
by your order while he was under your control, understand that you are liable
for both principal and interest, and will be compelled to pay them, in order
that the property pledged may be released. If, however, you became surety for
the money lent, it is a well-established rule of law that you will be
responsible under this obligation.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of the Caesars.

9. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Isidor.
If you became a debtor under a contract which had not an unlawful loan for its
object, or if you became surety for your father, you will legally be liable for
the indebtedness, whether you are under the control of your father, or whether,
by his death, you have become independent. If you are the heir of your father,
you will be liable in full; otherwise, for as much as you are able to pay in
accordance with the terms of the Edict. If, however, you have become your own
master by emancipation, you should understand that you are equally liable.
Given at Byzantium, on the sixth of the Idesof April, under the Consulate of
the Csesars.

10. The Same, and the Csesars, to Diogenes and Aphrodisius.
When slaves, having the free administration of their peculium,sell mares with
their colts, which form part of said peculium,their master will not have the
power to rescind the contract. If, however, the said slaves, not having the
free administration of their peculium,should sell property belonging to their
master, without his knowledge, they cannot transfer to another the ownership
which they do not possess, nor can they deliver lawful possession to purchasers
who are aware of their servile condition. Hence, it is clearly not unreasonable
that such purchasers cannot be benefited by prescription based upon long time;
and therefore, having purchased movable property from a slave, they will also
be liable in an action for theft.
Given on the fifth of the Nonesof October, during the Consulate of the Csesars.

11. The Same, and the Csesars, to Attains.
Where anyone makes a contract with a female slave (whom it is established by
law cannot legally be bound) against her master for the amount to which her
peculiumhas been increased during the lifetime of the said slave, there is no
doubt that an action should be granted within the available year after her
death.
Given on the day before the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.

12. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Victor.
It has been established by the Perpetual Edict that a master cannot be bound by
his slave, and that an action should be granted the creditors of the latter
only to the extent of his peculium,after having deducted the amount which he
naturally owes to his master; or, if it should be proved that any of the money
was employed for the benefit of the master's property, an action can be granted
them on this ground.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of the
Casars.

13. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
It is clear that masters are liable under the Prsetorian action which is
designated Quod jussu,if they direct their slaves or agents to count out a
certain sum of money. Hence We order, by this law, which shall have the force
of an Edict and be perpetual, that where anyone lends money to a slave, a serf,
a tenant, an agent, or a steward, the masters or cultivators of the land will
not be liable; and it is not proper that friendly letters, by which men
frequently recommend a person who is absent, should cause money which was not
asked for to be expended for the benefit of land, as a master cannot legally be
liable unless money was especially furnished at his request.
We desire that any creditors who, without the order of the master and without
having received sureties for that purpose, advance money to persons of this
kind, shall lose what they have lent. Where, however, an agent, a slave, or the
superintendent of land should be found not to owe any to his master on account
of the property of which he had administered, We grant permission to a creditor
to avail himself of a prsetorian action with reference to the peculium.
Given at Ravenna, on the fifth of the Idesof July, during the Consulate of
Honorius, Consul for the tenth time, and Theodosius, Consul for the sixth time,
415.



TITLE XXVII.
BY MEANS OF WHAT PERSONS PROPERTY CAN BE ACQUIRED BY Us.

1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Marcella.
It is an undoubted rule of law that, with the exception of possession, nothing
can be acquired for us by a free person who is not sub-
ject to the authority of another. Therefore, if an agent should make a
contract, not in his own name, but in that of the person whose business he is
transacting, by which, under certain circumstances, he reserves the right to
demand the return of the property sold, and a stipulation is attached to the
contract, no obligation is acquired by the master. Where, however, property has
been delivered to slaves, it is acquired for their master.
Given on the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of the same Emperors.

2. The Emperor Justinian to Julian, Prsetorian Prefect.
Whenever a sum of money is counted out by one free person in the name of
another, the right to a personal action will be acquired by him in whose name
the money is lent by this act of counting it, but the right of hypothecation or
pledge of property given to an agent will not be acquired by the principal
parties to the contract; and for the purpose of disposing of this difference,
We order that the right to the personal action, as well as that to the
hypothecary action shall, by operation of law and without any assignment, vest
in the principal party to the contract. For if the agent is required by law to
assign his right of action to his principal, why should the assignment of this
action appear to be superfluous in the beginning, and will not the principal
party to the contract in the case of pledge or hypothecation in like manner
acquire for himself the hypothecary action, the pledge, or the right to retain
the same?
Given on the Kalendsof November, during the fifth Consulate of Lampadius and
Orestes, 530.
3. The Same to Julian, Prsetorian Prefect.
When two or more persons own a slave in common, and one of them orders him to
make a stipulation for something in his name, for example for ten aurei,or for
some other property, and the said slave mentions, not the name of the one who
gives the order, but that of another of his masters, and stipulates in the name
of the latter, the question arose among the ancient authorities, who would be
entitled to the action, or the profit growing out of this transaction, he who
gave the order, or the one whom the slave mentioned, or both? As all these
opinions were, after much discussion, adopted by a large number of authorities,
the better opinion seems to Us to be that of those who held that the
stipulation should be considered as made by the person who ordered it to be
done, and who asserts that he alone was entitled to the acquisition, rather
than the views of the others which are stated on this point. For no indulgence
should be shown to the wickedness of slaves, so that they, after treating the
orders of their masters with contempt, may be permitted to enter into
stipulations according to their own wishes, and thereby transfer to another
master, who perhaps had corrupted them, the profit to which someone else was
entitled. Nor ought it to be tolerated that an impious slave may think no
obedience should be paid to his master, who had given
him the order, and that he was at liberty to confer an unexpected benefit upon
another who, perhaps, had no knowledge of the transaction; for it was
repeatedly stated by the ancients that the order of a master did not differ
from an appointment, and ought to be obeyed when a slave was ordered by one of
his masters to make a stipulation, without stating in whose name it should be
done; for in this instance, the one who gave the order would be the only one to
obtain the benefit. Where, however, he mentioned the name of another of his
masters, the acquisition will be solely to his advantage, for it is much more
important than his order.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof December, during the fifth Consulate of
Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
TITLE XXVIII. CONCERNING THE MACEDONIAN DECREE OP THE SENATE.
1. The Emperor Mlius Pertinax to Atilius.
If you can prove that for good reasons you believed the statements of a son
under paternal control, to whom you lent money, and who stated that he was the
head of a household, he shall be refused an exception.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Falco and
Clarus, 194.
2. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Sophia.
Whether Zenodorus, who was generally considered to be his own master,
contracted with the consent of his father, or received a sum of money to be
employed in matters with which the latter was charged, and afterwards, having
become independent by means of a novation, or in some other manner, he assumed
liability for the debt, it is reasonable that the Decree of the Senate should
not be applicable.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Saturninus
and Gallus, 199.
3. The Same to Macrinus.
Where a son, subject to the authority of his father, having purchased
something, promised to pay the price of the same with interest to the vendor,
there is no doubt that the Decree of the Senate by which a son under paternal
control is forbidden to pay any interest will not apply; for the origin of the
obligation rather than the title of the action should be taken into
consideration.
Given on the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Saturninus and Gallus, 199.
4. The Same to Cyrilla.
If you lent money to a son under paternal control with the permission of his
father, the authority of the Decree of the Senate cannot be invoked. Hence the
recovery of the pledge which formed part
of the property of the father will not be refused, especially where the son
becomes his heir, provided no other creditor appears whose rights are
preferable to yours under the terms of a contract, or in point of time.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Fabian and
Mutian, 202.
5. The Emperor Alexander to Musa.
The authority of the Macedonian Decree of the Senate does not prevent a demand
being made for money which was lent to a son under paternal control, for the
purpose of prosecuting his studies, or in order to meet the necessary expenses
of an embassy, which paternal affection would not have refused him. The action
De peculiagrowing out of the contract of the son will lie, even after his
death, against his father, where the time of the available year does not
prevent it from being brought. If, indeed, the money is proved to have been
loaned, by order of the father, it will not be necessary to inquire to what use
it was put, but the action can be brought against the father without limitation
of time, even after the death of the son.
Given on the day before the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Agricola and
Clementinus, 231.
6. The Emperor Philip and the Cassar Philip to Theopompus.
If your son, while under your control, should borrow money in violation to the
Macedonian Decree of the Senate, the action De peculiocan, under no
circumstances, be legally brought against you on this account. Although the
Decree of the Senate only mentions a son under paternal control, its provisions
extend to grandsons and great-grandsons.
Given on the sixth of the Nonesof March, during the Consulate of Philip and
Titian, 246.
7. The Emperor Justinian to Julian, Praetorian Prefect.
If a son under paternal control should borrow money without the order, mandate,
or consent of his father, and the latter should afterwards ratify the contract,
We, with a view of disposing of the doubts entertained by the ancient jurists
on this subject, do hereby order that, just as if the said son under paternal
control had, in the beginning, borrowed the money with the consent or under the
direction of his father, he shall be absolutely liable; so that even if his
father afterwards ratifies his contract, it will still be valid, as it would be
unjust to reject the paternal consent. For the ratification of the father is
not unlike his mandate given in the first place, or his consent; as, in
accordance with Our new law, every ratification has a retroactive effect, and
confirms everything which was done from the beginning.
These rules are applicable to the transactions of private persons.
(1) Where, however, a son under paternal control, who is a soldier, borrows
money without either the mandate, consent, approbation, or ratification of his
father, the contract must stand; and it
makes no difference for what purpose the money was borrowed, or how it was
expended, as, according to several principles of law, soldiers are considered
to resemble men who are their own masters, and a soldier is always presumed not
to have borrowed and expended any money except for some purpose connected with
his military service. Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof August, during the
fifth Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
TITLE XXXXIIXX..CONCERNING THE VELLEIAN DECREE OF THE SENATE.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Lucilla.
Relief is granted by the Decree of the Senate to women who become liable, or
assume the obligations of others, when the contracting parties are not aware of
the fact. If, however, having voluntarily assumed the obligation, they should
pay money in behalf of others when they are not liable, they will have no right
of recovery.
Given on the Nonesof December, during the Consulate of Gentian and Bassus, 212.
2. The Same to Nepotiana.
You have in vain attempted to avail yourself of the exception authorized by the
Decree of the Senate, enacted for the benefit of women who become sureties for
others, as you yourself are the principal debtor; for the exception of the
Decree of the Senate is only granted to a woman where she herself owes nothing
as principal, but has become surety to a creditor for another debtor. If,
however, she should obligate herself to the creditor of another person, or
permit herself to be delegated for his debtor, she will not be entitled to the
benefit of this Decree of the Senate.
Given on the third of the Idesof August, during the Consulate of Antoninus,
Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
3. The Same to Servatus.
If you yourself borrowed a sum of money, and your mother, in violation of the
Decree of the Senate, became your surety, she can defend herself by means of an
exception.
Given on the third of the Idesof August, during the Consulate of Antoninus,
Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
4. The Emperor Alexander to Alexandra.
The Decree of the Senate applies when a woman has assumed an obligation
incurred by another, or when she becomes surety for him; or where someone has
borrowed money, and she herself is the principal debtor in the beginning. This
occurs whenever her own property is encumbered for the obligations of others.
If, however, you, being at the time more than twenty-five years of age, sold
your land
and paid the purchase-money for the benefit of your husband, the aid of the
Decree of the Senate cannot be invoked.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and Julianus, 224.
5. The Same to Popilia.
If your property has been pledged by your husband without your consent, it will
not, legally, be encumbered. Where, however, you have agreed to the obligation,
and the creditor was aware of the fact, you can avail yourself of the aid of
the Decree of the Senate. But if you permitted your husband to encumber your
property, as if it was his own, with the intention of deceiving the creditor,
relief cannot be granted you under the Decree of the Senate, which was enacted
to protect the weakness, and not the duplicity of women.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Julian,
Consul for the second time, and Crispinus, 225.
6. The Same to Torquatus.
When a mother, while transacting the business of her daughters, gives security
to their guardians by furnishing a surety, or delivering pledges, as she is
considered, to a certain extent, as having attended to their affairs, neither
she nor the surety furnished by her can take advantage of the Decree of the
Senate, nor will she derive any benefit from the fact that her own property was
pledged.
(1) When the guardian desires to excuse himself, and the mother interposes to
prevent it, and promises him indemnity, she will by no means be prevented from
availing herself of the aid of the Decree of the Senate.
(2) If, however, she should demand a guardian, and voluntarily assume
responsibility for the guardianship, the authority of the law will prevent her
from becoming liable.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof October, during the Consulate of Modestus and
Probus, 229.
7. The Emperor Gordian to Vivian.
Where a creditor has knowingly received from a husband, as security for his own
debt, land which belonged to his wife, even with her consent, he cannot, by
selling the land, deprive the woman of ownership, on account of the protection
afforded by the Decree of the Senate; and it would not be necessary for you,
when you claim the property, to pay the price to the purchaser, if you have
become your mother's heir.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of Pius and
Pontianus, 239.
8. The Same to Tripho.
If children of both sexes, who have been emancipated, jointly assume a debt of
their father, although the daughters are exempted from the obligations of men
by the exception of the Velleian Decree
of the Senate, the sons will, nevertheless, be liable to the extent to which
they have bound themselves; and there is no doubt that the daughters having
thus been exempted, the father can be sued for the same amount for which he
would have been responsible if his daughters had not become bound for him. The
pledges given by the father will undoubtedly be encumbered if they were
received for the last obligation. If, however, they were obtained on account of
the first obligation, they will only be liable in proportion to the amount
returned to the father by the Actio restitutoria.
Given on the Nonesof October, during the Consulate of Pius and Pontianus, 239.
9. The Same to Proculus.
Although a woman can make payment in behalf of another, still, if she should do
so by virtue of an obligation which is not valid under the Decree of the
Senate, and she is ignorant that she was entitled to the benefit of the Decree,
she will have a right to recover the money.
Given on the Nonesof July, under the Consulate of Gordian and Aviola, 240.
10. The Emperor Philip and the Csesar Philip to Triphona.
If your adversary entered into a business transaction with you but not with
your husband, you can, under the pretext that an obligation of this kind is
void, refuse to pay the balance of the rent which you agreed that you
contracted for. If the owner leased the land, not to you but to your husband,
and accepted you as surety for him, you can also defend yourself by pleading
the benefit of the Decree of the Senate, which was enacted with reference to
women becoming sureties.
Given on the eighteenth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of
Peregrinus and Jiiimlianus, 245.
11. The Same to Ebora.
It is a well-established rule of law that, while marriage exists, the right of
hypothecation or pledge can be granted to the husband.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of
Peregrinus and J^milianus, 245.
12. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus to Sepiduta.
If, desiring to endow your daughter, you have encumbered your property to your
son-in-law, you are mistaken if you think that you can invoke the aid of the
Decree of the Senate, for persons learned in the law have held that a case of
this kind is not entitled to that privilege.
Given on the ninth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Tuscus and
Bassus, 339.
13. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Condiana.
If money has actually been lent to you at interest by your creditor, whether it
is alleged that the entire amount, or only a portion
of the same, has been employed for the benefit of your husband, you cannot
avail yourself of the Decree of the Senate, even though your creditor may not
have been ignorant of the cause of the contract.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of the same
Emperors.
14. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Basilissa.
A woman cannot become surety in violation of the terms of the Velleian Decree
of the Senate, and the law permits her sureties to avail themselves of the same
exception. Therefore if your mother should not become the heir of her husband,
she will be sufficiently protected by the remedy of the exception authorized by
the Decree of the Senate.
Given at Byzantium, on the eighth of the Kalendsof April, under the Consulate
of the Caesars.
15. The Same, and the Csesars, to Agripimis.
If a woman, desiring to become surety for her husband contrary to the
provisions of the Decree of the Senate, asks you to bind yourself for her as
mandator, and suit is brought against you, you can defend yourself by means of
the exception originating from this contract, and you will be released from
liability.
Given on the eighteenth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of the
Cassars.
16. The Same, and the Csesars, to Rufinus.
When a woman assumes the obligation of another, and relief is granted her by
means of the exception of the Velleian Decree of the Senate, the action to
establish him in his rights against his former debtors shall be granted the
creditor.
Given on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
17. The Same, and the Cassars, to Alexander and Others.
If your father borrowed money from Callistratus, and an instrument was drawn up
which makes it appear that his wife had borrowed it, it is not necessary to
have recourse to the exception granted by the Decree of the Senate, as the
actual truth, rather than a fictitious transaction, will protect the woman.
Given on the third of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of the Caesars.
18. The Same, and the Csesars, to Zopicus.
Relief is granted to women who have assumed the obligations of others, whether
they are old or of recent date, unless the creditor has, in some way or other,
been deceived by the woman; for it has been established that the exception of
the Decree of the Senate will not be applicable when a reply on the ground of
fraud is filed.
Given at Antioch, on the fifth of the Idesof November, under the Consulate of
the Cajsars.
19. The Same, and the Cassars, to Faustina,.
It is provided by the Perpetual Edict that the Decree of the Senate enacted
with reference to the suretyship of women applies to such obligations as women
have assumed in the first place, through the fraudulent acts of creditors; and
if a creditor who intended to make a contract with another party should
afterwards choose a woman, you can be defended by an exception against persons
attempting to enforce their claims in accordance to what you allege.
Given at Nicomedia, on the eighteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the
Consulate of the Caesars.
20. The Same, and the Czesars, to Theodotian.There is no doubt that the heirs
of a woman can also make use of the exception granted by the Decree of the
Senate against her
creditors.
Given on the ninth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
21. The Emperor Anastasius to Celer, Master of the Offices.
We order that women shall be permitted to voluntarily renounce the rights of
hypothecation to which they are entitled on account of one or several
contracts, or one of certain persons or things; and whatever is done in this
manner shall, by Our authority, remain firm and irrevocable, so that if a
renunciation of this kind is made for only one contract, as has been stated, or
for several, or where the woman has given her consent with reference to one or
several persons or things, which have been, or are to be made use of, this
renunciation shall be confined to such persons or things as have been, or shall
be agreed to, and not to any other contracts to which women have not given, or
may not give their consent, and that permission shall be granted to oppose
anyone making a contrary claim.
We decree by this carefully considered law that its provisions shall be
applicable to all future contracts, matters, and controversies which have not
been settled by compromise or final judgment, or disposed of in any other
lawful manner.
Given on the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Anatolius and Agapitus.
Extract from Novel 61, Chapter I. Latin Text.
Where a marriage-gift has been given by me or by anyone else for my benefit,
and the property is immovable, I can neither alienate nor encumber it.
Therefore, in a contract of this description, the consent of the woman is of no
avail to prevent the action in rem,by which, after the marriage has been
dissolved, she is entitled to recover property given her at the time of the
betrothal, unless she has given consent a second time, when the term of two
years has elapsed, and her husband has other property out of which her claim
can be satisfied.
Leaving these two cases out of consideration, the rights of the woman cannot be
prejudiced, no matter how often she gives her consent; and if the husband makes
such an alienation, he will be liable with reference to his other property,
since, so far as the woman is concerned, transactions of this kind are
considered not to have been either entered into or written.
(1) There is much more reason for these provisions to apply to dowries, in
order to prevent any movable property which composes them from being alienated
or encumbered; for all the privileges granted in favor of dowries continue to
exist in full force, whether the woman herself institutes proceedings, or
someone else does so in her name.
22. The Emperor Justinian to Julian, Praetorian Prefect.
If a woman who has arrived at her majority subsequently furnishes security, or
a bond, a pledge, or a surety should be given by her, We decree that the
ancient inconsistencies in the law shall be abolished, and that, if within the
term of two years to be computed after the first security has been furnished,
she has given either a bond, a pledge or a surety in the same matter, her
rights shall not be prejudiced, because, as the result of her weakness, she has
for a second time exposed herself to loss.
If, however, she should do this after the lapse of two years, she herself shall
be to blame, if, having been able to meditate frequently, and avoid what she
had done, she did not do so, but voluntarily confirmed it; as, on account of
the length of the time, she should be considered as not having bound herself
for the obligation of another, but to have acted in her own behalf, and to have
rendered herself liable under the second bond for the amount contained therein,
as well as legally to have given the pledge or the surety.
Extract from Novel 134, Chapter Vill. Latin Text.
When a woman has given her consent to a written instrument evidencing a debt of
her own husband, or has signed the same, and encumbered her individual property
for herself, We order that an agreement of this kind shall be absolutely void,
whether she did this only once or several times with reference to the same
transaction, and whether the debt is a private or a public one; and that it
shall be considered to have been neither agreed to, nor written, unless it is
clearly proved that the money was expended for the benefit of the woman
herself.
23. The Same to Julian, Praetorian Prefect.
For the purpose of removing the subtleties and difficulties of ancient
jurisprudence, and desiring to abolish superfluous distinctions, We order that
where a woman has offered herself as surety, and has received anything in the
beginning or afterwards, in consideration of so doing, she shall, under all
circumstances, be liable, and cannot invoke the aid of the Velleian Decree of
the Senate, whether she has
incurred liability with or without an instrument in writing. If, indeed, she
should state in the instrument itself that she had received something, and, on
this account, had furnished security, and it should be ascertained that the
said instrument had been publicly executed and attested by three witnesses, it
must, by all means, be believed that she did receive money or other property,
and she cannot have recourse to the privilege of the Velleian Decree of the
Senate.
When, however, she became surety without any bond, or if the instrument was not
drawn up in this manner, then, if the stipulator can show that she received
either money or property, and in consideration of the same rendered herself
liable, she shall be excluded from the relief of the Decree of the Senate. But
if this should not be proved by him, the woman will then be entitled to relief,
and the ancient right of action will be preserved in favor of the creditor
against the person for whom the woman became surety.
(1) If anyone should give money or other property to a woman who was not
qualified to become a surety, in order that she might obligate herself for him,
she who actually received the said money or property shall not be permitted to
have recourse to the authority of the Decree of the Senate, and the creditor is
hereby authorized to proceed against her to collect whatever he can, and to sue
the old debtor for the remainder, that is, for a part of the debt if he was
able to collect something from the woman; or for the entire amount of it if she
was in absolute want.
(2) In order that women may not wrongfully become sureties for others, We order
that they cannot obligate themselves for any contract of this kind, unless by
an instrument publicly executed and signed by three witnesses; for then they
will only be bound where they comply with all the formalities provided by the
ancient laws, or introduced by Imperial authority, which have reference to
security furnished by women.
If, however, women should agree to become sureties in violation of this law,
any document designed for this purpose, or any unwritten obligation shall be
considered void, and as never drawn up or executed ; so that the aid of the
Decree of the Senate may not be invoked, but the woman shall be absolutely
released from all liability, just as if no transaction of this kind had ever
taken place.
24. The Same to Julian, Prsetorian Prefect.
With a view to disposing of the doubts of the ancients, We decree that, if
anyone should impose as a condition for the manumission of his slave that a
woman should render herself liable for a certain sum of money, if the slave
obtained his freedom, whether she bound herself as principal, or did so in
behalf of the slave, We order that she shall without question legally be bound,
and that the Velleian Decree of the Senate shall not apply to such a case; for
it is sufficiently hard, and contrary to the principles of benevolence, for the
owner of the slave, having placed confidence in the woman who either personally
guaranteed the debt, or promised to pay it if the slave did
not, to give the slave his freedom and lose him, and not to receive what he was
entitled to for his manumission.
25. The Same to the People of the City of Constantinople and of All the
Provinces.
We decree, in general, that where anyone, either male or female, who is over
the age of twenty-five years, has promised a dowry or bound himself or herself
to give one for the benefit of any person whomsoever with whom a marriage can
be legally contracted, they shall, by all means, be compelled to comply with
their contract; for it ought not to be tolerated that, on account of some
accidental circumstances, the women should not be endowed, and for this reason
perhaps be rejected by her husband, and the marriage be dissolved; as We are
well aware that the ancient lawgivers often softened the rigor of the rule in
favor of dowries, and with good reason We promulgate this law. For, if anyone
should voluntarily display liberality in the beginning, either he or she should
fulfill his or her promises, so that what was by consent committed to writing
in the first place, or was merely the subject of a verbal promise, may be
afterwards complied with, even against the will of the parties, all the
authority of the Velleian Decree of the Senate becoming inoperative in a case
of this kind.
TITLE XXX. CONCERNING MONEY WHICH Is NOT COUNTED OUT.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Hilarius.
If the sum of money was not counted out to you, and you allege that for this
reason you have executed a bond for the payment of something which you did not
receive, and you can prove that a pledge was given, you can bring an action in
rem;for proceedings dependent upon the delivery of a pledge, where the money
was not paid over, cannot be instituted, unless the genuineness of the debt is
established. For the same reason, the truth must be shown, if your adversary
should institute proceedings while you are in possession of the pledge.
Given on the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of Later-anus and
Rufinus.
2. The Emperor Antoninus to Maturius.
If it is proved before the judge having cognizance of the case that you have
received a smaller sum of money than you have given security to pay, he shall
order you not to pay any more than you have received, together with the
interest agreed upon in the stipulation.
3. The Same to Demetrius.
When suit is brought against you on your note, although an hypothecation may
have been given, and you plead an exception on the ground of fraud, or because
the money was not counted out to you, the plaintiff will be compelled to prove
that it was paid, and if he does not do so, you will be released from
liability.
4. The Same to Bassanus.
-As you acknowledge the genuineness of your obligation, and have even paid a
part of the debt or the interest, you understand that it is too late for you to
make complaint that the money was not counted out to you.
Extract from Novel 18, Chapter Vill. Latin Text.
When anyone denies his own writing on account of which suit was brought against
him, as well as that the money was counted out to him, and loses his case,
judgment shall be rendered against him for double damages, unless, the oath
having been tendered him, he confesses judgment; for then he will not be
punished, except by being compelled to pay the expenses incurred by the amount
of proof which should be fixed by the oath of the plaintiff. If, however, after
denying that the money was counted, he admits that he received it, the entire
sum should, by all means, be collected, and he should not have credit for what
he alleges he has already paid. But, on the other hand, if the plaintiff should
deny his own handwriting produced by the defendant, the same penalty and oath
should be imposed; and the same penalty should be inflicted upon a curator, if
he raises any question as to an instrument in his own handwriting connected
with the trust of which he has charge.
5. The Emperor Alexander to Haustianus.
If you have any legal defence against the claims of your adversary, you can
make use of them; but you should not be ignorant of the fact that the exception
on the ground of money not having been counted out will apply whenever suit is
brought for a loan. When the amount is stated in the note, which is the
evidence of the obligation, inquiry is not made whether it was counted out at
the time when security was furnished, but whether there was a good
consideration for the debt.
6. The Same to Justin.
You are wrong if you think that you are protected by an exception on the ground
that the money was not counted out, when, as you acknowledge, you substituted
yourself as the debtor of the person who was originally liable.
7. The Same to Julian and Ammianus.
If, when expecting to receive a loan, you gave security to your adversary for
money which was not counted out, you can recover your obligation by means of a
personal action, even if the plaintiff should not bring suit, or, if he does,
you can avail yourself of an exception on the ground that the money was not
counted.
8. The Same to Maternus.
When the person who signed the note dies within the time prescribed by law,
without having filed any complaint, his heir will be
entitled to the remaining time to proceed either against the creditor or his
heir. If, however, he instituted proceedings before his death, an exception on
the ground that money was not counted out will lie, without limitation of time,
either for or against his heir. But when he permitted the prescribed time to
elapse without having filed any complaint, the heir of the debtor, even if he
is a minor, will be compelled to pay the debt.
9. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Zoilus.
As it is settled that no one can be forced to pay a larger sum than that which
he received, if, a stipulation having been entered into, the creditor should
not pay over the amount agreed upon, it is established that an exception in
factumshould be granted, provided the time during which a complaint of this
kind can be made has not yet expired; or if the creditor, within the prescribed
time, should comply with what was legally required of him, the ruler or
Governor of the province, having been applied to, will not permit more to be
collected from you as principal than you received.
10. The Same to Mezantius.
The statement of a person who contends that his debt was paid is not excluded
by lapse of time. Nor can it be alleged against him that the right to make use
of the exception on the ground that the money was not counted out, not having
been taken advantage of within the prescribed time, is extinguished; as a great
difference exists between one who states a fact and undertakes to establish it
by evidence, and one who denies that the money was paid over, of which no proof
is possible according to natural reasons; hence it becomes necessary for the
plaintiff to establish the truth of his allegations.
11. The Same to Eutychianus.
If you have promised to pay to Palladius a certain sum of money by way of
compromise, you cannot defend yourself by an exception on the ground that the
money was not counted out.
12. The Same to Severianus.
The exception on the ground that the money was not paid will lie in favor of a
mandator or a surety, just as in the case of a principal debtor.
13. The Emperor Justin to Theodore, Prsetorian Prefect.
Generally speaking, We decree that where security was given in writing for the
payment of any sums of money whatsoever, on account of some preceding
consideration, and where the promisor has explicitly stated what it was, he
shall not be allowed to exact proof of the same from the stipulator, as he must
acquiesce in his own admission; unless on the other hand he can, by clear
evidence obtained from the instrument itself, show that the transaction was of
a dif-
ferent character than that provided for therein; as We think that it is highly
improper for anyone, in the same transaction, to dispute and resist with his
own testimony what he has already openly acknowledged.
14. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Prsetorian Prefect.
In written contracts by which money or any other property is either counted out
or given to a person or his successor, who stated in writing that he has
received the said money or other property, he cannot within five years plead
the exception on the ground that the money was not counted out to him, as was
formerly the rule; but he can only do so within the term of two continuous
years, and, if this period has elapsed, no complaint based on the assertion
that the money was not counted out can be interposed.
Those persons, however, who for some reasons especially set forth in the law
are entitled to relief even after the said term of five years has elapsed, will
hereafter have a right to enjoy the same privilege, even though the term of two
years has been established instead of the former one of five.
(1) But as litigants may attempt to plead an exception of this kind against
receipts or written instruments relating to the deposit of property or money,
We have considered it to be just to abolish the power to do this in certain
cases, and in others to limit it to a very short time. Therefore, We decree
that an exception on the ground that the money was not counted out cannot,
under any circumstances, be pleaded against an instrument showing that certain
property or a sum of money was deposited; or against receipts given for public
contributions (whether they were made out in acknowledgment of the entire
amount or for only a portion of the same), as well as against other receipts
drawn up after the completion of dotal instruments, in which it is stated that
the dowry has been entirely, or only partly paid.
(2) With respect to other receipts made out by a creditor with reference to
private debts, showing that a part on the principal or interest of the same has
been paid; and that while settlement of the principal has been made, the
contract for the payment of interest still remained in his hands, or promising
the future return of the instrument evidencing the loan; or if a receipt
relating to any other kind of a contract has been given in which the payment of
money or the delivery of certain articles has been stated in writing, and
setting forth that the money has been paid, or the other property has been
delivered either wholly or in part; the exception on the ground of money not
having been counted out can only be pleaded within thirty, days to be computed
after the delivery of the receipt, so that, when they have elapsed, the said
receipt shall be accepted by the judges as valid under all circumstances, nor
shall the person who produced it be permitted (after the lapse of the above-
mentioned thirty days), to state that the money has not been paid, or the other
property delivered.
(3) The rule should be always observed that an oath cannot be tendered in cases
where it is not allowed to plead an exception on the ground that the money was
not counted out, either in the first place, or after the prescribed time has
elapsed.
(4) He in whose favor an exception of this kind will lie shall be permitted,
during the time above-mentioned in which the exception can be interposed, to
state in writing his complaint based on the claim that the money was not
counted out, or the property delivered by him who was alleged in the written
document to have done so.
Or, if the party in question should happen to be absent from the place in which
the contract was made, he can state his case in this Fair City before any
ordinary judge, and in the provinces before the illustrious Governor of the
same, or the defenders of the district; and in this manner obtain for himself
the right to plead an exception without limitation of time.
If, however, he who was said in the instrument to have counted out the money,
or to have delivered the property, conducts any administration either in this
Fair City, or in the provinces, so that it may appear to be difficult to notify
him, We grant permission to the person who desires to avail himself of the
exception above-mentioned to go before any other judges either in this Fair
City or in the provinces, and by means of them notify him against whom he
desires to plead an exception of this kind that a complaint has been filed by
him on the ground that the money was not paid over.
When there is no other civil or military official in the provinces, or for some
reason it is difficult for him who opposes the above-mentioned complaint to
appear and perform the acts provided for, We grant him permission to notify his
creditor of the exception by means of the most reverend bishop and, in this
manner, to interrupt the time prescribed by law. It is certain that these
provisions with reference to an exception also apply to cases where the dowry
has been counted out.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof July, under the second Consulate of
Our Lord Justinian.
Extract from Novel 100, Chapter I. Latin Text.
It is necessary for this complaint to be made in writing, and if anyone appears
to resist it in court, the woman, or by all means the person who has promised
the dowry, must be notified.
15. The Same to Menna^ Prietorian Prefect.
If the party, in whose favor the exception on the ground of money not having
been counted out can be pleaded, fails to avail himself of the privilege, if he
is present or absent, his creditors (whether they themselves are sued as having
possession of his property, for the purpose of collecting the debts of the
person entitled to this exception, either on the ground of dowry, or for any
other reason; or whether they have brought suit against others in possession of
the property) can, during the hearing of the case, interpose the excep-
tion against their adversary for the reason that the money was not counted out;
nor will they be prevented from doing so because the principal debtor never
availed himself of it. Therefore, in order that no prejudice may result to the
principal debtor or to his surety, if the party who opposes the exception
should be defeated, they can, afterwards, if they should be sued, protect
themselves by the same exception within the time prescribed by law.
16. The Same to John, Praetorian Prefect.
It is an undoubted rule of law that the exception on the ground of money not
having been counted out is applicable to all claims, either for the agreement
for the payment of interest, or to other obligations in which mention is made
of an oath. For what difference is there in an exception of this kind, whether
the oath was or was not taken with reference to agreements for the payment of
interest, or other written instruments against which an exception of this kind
can be pleaded?
TITLE XXXXXXII..CONCERNING SET-OFF.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Dianensus.
The Senate decreed, and it has frequently been stated in rescripts, that there
is ground for set-off in fiscal cases, where the same administration both owes
and asserts the claim. This rule should be implicitly observed, in order to
avoid confusion in different offices. Where, however, anything is proved to be
due to you from the administration which you have mentioned, you shall
immediately receive it.
2. The Same to Asclepiada.
As where something remains due on account of a judgment which has been paid, it
cannot be recovered, so for the same reason it cannot be admitted to set-off.
No one, however, doubts that anyone who is sued to enforce a judgment can
demand a set-off of the money due to him from the other party.
3. The Emperor Alexander to Capita.
The judge having jurisdiction of the case shall order that what you allege is
due to you from the government shall be set-off against the amount that you
admit you are indebted to it, provided your indebtedness is not on account, or
because of taxes, or money due for grain or oil belonging to the State, or
tribute, or provisions; or you are not a debtor of the official having charge
of the expenses of the government; or by reason of trusts for the benefit of a
municipality.
4. The Same to Lucian.
If it is established that when two persons owe one another, set-off will take
place by operation of law, instead of payment from the
time at which both parties began to be mutually indebted, so far as the amount
of the two obligations agree; and interest will only be due for the excess of
the indebtedness owing to one of them, where his claim has not been satisfied.
5. The Same to Honorata.
If it should be established that you are entitled to a trust out of the
property of the person to whom you say you are indebted for a smaller sum, the
equity of set-off excludes the computation of interest ; provided you prove
that the claim which is due to you is larger than that which you owe.
6. The Same to Pollidens.
The documents by which it is provided that you have received what you deny has
been delivered to you cannot bind you in opposition to the truth, and you may
properly demand the justice of a set-off; for it is not equitable that you
should be compelled to pay what it is established that you owe, before your
demand for money lent has been answered; and you have still more ground to
recover the property which you allege has been appropriated by your wife on
account of divorce.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of
Alexander, Consul for the third time, and Dio.
7. The Same to Euzosius.
Where the price of property sold is due to the vendor, the law of set-off will
apply, for purchasers are not forbidden to oppose the set-off of the price,
even against the Treasury.
8. The Emperor Gordian to Emeritus.
If your stepfather has become your debtor on account of crops taken from your
land, and he brings suit against you for what has been left to you by your
mother, judgment shall be rendered in favor of him who has the largest claim,
and you will not unreasonably demand a set-off.
9. The Same to Eumenides.
Set-off cannot take place except with reference to what is due from the party
against whom the action was brought.
10. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Nicander.
As you allege that the land which was sold to you as free was, before the
purchase, encumbered by a lien, and you have paid a certain sum to release it,
if you should be sued for a debt before the Governor of the province, you can
set off the amount which you paid, although it was not due.
11. The Same to Julian and Paulus.
If, having been compelled to do so by a magistrate, you appointed guardians for
minors, and paid in their behalf a certain sum of money
due on account of a charge of the Chief Centurion of the Triarii, you are
mistaken if you think that, if you should be sued by them, you cannot claim a
set-off; no matter whether the sum which has been collected from you is as much
as the guardians were liable for to their wards, or whether it is proved that
you paid a larger sum on their account.
12. The Same to Cornelmnus.
If you have availed yourself of a set-off with reference to a debt, and pay the
remainder, you can bring suit to recover your pledges, if you tender the amount
and your creditors refuse to accept it, and, having sealed it up, you deposit
it.
13. The Same, and the Csesars, to Bassus.
If you agreed with Mutian in writing that he should, by way of set-off, pay
what you owed as public taxes, and that afterwards you would not demand what he
owed you, and you yourself should pay the taxes referred to, you cannot recover
the amount as not having been due, but you will have the right to collect the
debt to which you were previously entitled.
14. The Emperor Justinian to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
We decree that set-offs shall take place by operation of law in all lawsuits,
without making any distinction between real or personal actions.
(1) Hence We order that set-offs can be pleaded where the amount to be set off
is clear, and not involved in doubt, but is susceptible of being easily
determined; for it would be very unjust if, when the matter had been decided
after many and various contests, the other party, who almost lost his case,
could plead a set-off against a certain and unquestionable debt, and the hope
of a judgment be excluded by subterfuges admitting of delay. Therefore judges
must be careful not to admit set-offs too readily, or accept them with too much
indulgence, but to adhere strictly to the rule; and if they find that they
demand minute and protracted examination, they must reserve them for another
decision; so that the present suit, which has almost entirely been disposed of,
may be determined by a final judgment, with the exception of the action of
deposit, in which, in accordance with the rule which We have already
formulated, We have decided that there is no ground for set-off.
(2) The right of set-off is not granted to persons who are wrongfully in the
possession of property belonging to others.1
1 Set-off did not exist at Common Law, but was borrowed from the jurisprudence
of the Romans, to whom it was known as compensatio.In England, until the reign
of George II, when a statute authorizing the employment of this method of
extinguishing one obligation by means of another was enacted, a debt could only
be permanently settled by its payment, or by a voluntary release from liability
by the creditor. The Judicature Acts establish a distinction between a set-off
and a counter-claim. "A counter-claim is different from a set-off for it is
TITLE XXXII. CONCERNING INTEREST.
1. The Emperor Antoninus Pius to Evocatus.
Where, after investigation, the agreement to pay interest is proved to have
been legally made, even though it was not reduced to writing, it will still be
due under the law.
2. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Lucius.
When the purchaser, to whom the possession of property has been delivered, does
not tender the price to the vendor, even if he has placed the money on deposit,
sealed up, he will be required by the rule of equity to pay interest.
3. The Same to Julian.
Although interest on money lent cannot be claimed without a stipulation to that
effect having been made, still if it has been paid in accordance with the terms
of an informal agreement, it cannot be recovered as not due, nor be credited
upon the principal.
4. The Same to Honorius.
It has been established, and it is reasonable that interest can be demanded
where a pledge is retained, even though no stipulation may
in the nature of a cross-action." (Wilson's Practice of the Supreme Court of
Judicature IV, Page 51.)
Compensation, "debiti et crediti inter se contributio,"was only available when
the mutual obligations could be readily estimated at a pecuniary value; when
they were both positively known to be due at the time; and when the objects
through which the indebtedness was incurred were of the same nature. When an
exception on this ground was pleaded, it had a retroactive effect, and became
operative for the time when the right to employ it vested, and not from the
date of the joinder of issue.
The privilege of compensation could not be exercised where suit was brought to
recover property of which another illegally held possession, and thereby
attempted to profit by his own wrong.
Under the English and American law, a party defendant is not permitted to take
advantage of a set-off unless it is specially pleaded, and the facts upon which
the counter-claim is founded enumerated in detail.
In the United States, set-off can only be employed in agreements for the
payment of money, and when the amount of the reciprocal indebtedness is already
known, or may be definitely ascertained. It is not applicable where an attempt
is made by one party to extinguish an obligation incurred in a fiduciary
capacity, by means of one for which another is individually responsible, or
vice versa.As under the Civil Law, when one claim is larger than the other,
judgment may be rendered for the amount in excess. Unliquidated damages are not
susceptible of set-off, and it cannot be pleaded in actions for torts. Not only
original judgments, but also such as have been assigned for valuable
consideration, may be set off. This rule also applies to costs, whether the
indebtedness sought to be cancelled arises from money borrowed, or court
expenses or both. The failure of a defendant to avail himself of a valid set-
off is not considered a waiver of his right, and he will still be entitled to
collect his claim by suit, if he desires to do so; but if no good cause of
action exists, advantage cannot be taken of the privilege. (Vide,Parsons, The
Law of Contracts II, III, X.)ED.
have been entered into, as pledges are liable for interest even under an
informal agreement. This rule, however, does not apply to the case in which you
are interested, for at the time of the contract it was agreed that a smaller
rate of interest should be demanded, but afterwards, where the debtor promised
to pay a higher one, the retention of the pledge could not be considered legal,
as, at the time when the instruments were drawn up, it was not agreed that the
pledge should be subject to this increase.
5. The Same, and the Csesars, to Sabinus and Others.
The exception based on an agreement is available against the creditor who
demands a higher rate of interest under the terms of a stipulation, if it is
proved that for some years he received interest at a lower rate; and, in
accordance with this rule, your case can be defended against the municipal
officials who bring suit on the note, if you can prove that the maternal aunt
of your wards has always paid interest at five per cent, although she may have
agreed to a higher rate.
6. The Emperor Antoninus to Antieneus.
If you have, in the presence of witnesses, tendered to your creditor the money
due to her with the interest on the same, to secure the payment of which you
gave her pledges, and, she having declined to accept it, you deposited the
money sealed up, you will not be compelled to pay interest from the time when
you made the tender. If, however, your creditor should be absent, you must
tender the money in the presence of the Governor of the province.
7. The Same to Aristeus.
A creditor should prove his claim by the instruments evidencing the debt, and
also show that he has stipulated for interest, if he can do so; for even if the
interest has been voluntarily paid, this does not establish an obligation.
8. The Same to Theophorus.
Although when Bassa borrowed a sum of money she promised to pay interest at a
certain rate to Menophanes, and if she failed to pay it within a certain time,
she agreed to pay a higher rate (but one that was legal) ; still, if the
creditor, after the time prescribed by the note, receives the same interest as
formerly, and does not demand that interest at a higher rate be paid to him,
and it can be proved by this that he did not refuse interest at the lower rate,
it must be computed at the rate at which the creditor continued to collect it.
9. The Same to Probus.
It was not your fault that you did not pay interest at the lower rate within
the prescribed time, because the sons of the creditor were unwilling to receive
it through their guardians; and if you can prove in court that this was done,
interest at a higher rate will not be
required of you for the time during which it appears that you were not to
blame. If, however, you have deposited the principal, you will not be compelled
to pay interest from the time when it appears that this was done.
10. The Same to Donatus.
Where the interest paid at different times amounts to double the principal,
this will be of no advantage to the debtor; for it is only when the interest at
the time of payment amounts to more than the principal that it cannot be
collected.
11. The Same to PopUius.
When a creditor, who declines to receive money in payment of a debt to which he
is legally entitled, collects the crops of lands which have been hypothecated
to him, he diminishes the principal to the extent of the value of the said
crops.
12. The Emperor Alexander to Tyrannus.
The excess value of wheat or barley, above what has been lent, must be
surrendered even under an agreement without consideration.
13. The Same to Eustachia.
It is certain that an account must be taken of the interest in bona,
fideactions as well as in those based on voluntary agency. If, however, the
case has been terminated by a decision which awarded a smaller sum than that
which was due, and interest was not added, and no appeal was taken, what has
been decided cannot be revoked; nor can interest for the time which has elapsed
after the case was decided be demanded under any law, unless this was provided
for by the judgment.
14. The Same to Aurelius.
If your wife lent a sum of money with the understanding that she should live in
the house of her debtor instead of paying interest, and she did so, as was
agreed upon, and having leased the house, she did not collect the rent, the
question cannot be raised that she could have collected more rent than the
legal rate of interest amounted to. For although the house could have been
leased for more than the principal, the contract for interest was not, for that
reason, unlawful, but the house seemed to have been rented for less than it was
worth.
15. The Emperor Gordian to Claudius.
You state that your wife borrowed the sum of a thousand aureiunder the
condition that if she did not pay it within a certain time she would pay
fourfold the amount which she had borrowed; but the rule of law does not permit
the condition of a contract of this kind to provide for the payment of a
penalty in excess of the amount of legal interest.
16. The Same to Sulpitius.
As you say that you have received not grain, but money to be repaid with
interest, under the condition that a certain amount of wheat should be
delivered, instead of money, and that in case the grain was not delivered on
the day agreed upon, you contend that you will be compelled to deliver an
additional number of measures of grain, in fraud of the lawful amount of
interest, you can avail yourself of any proper defence against this dishonest
demand.
Extract from Novel 34, Chapter I. Latin Text.
Moreover, anyone who lends a farmer grain or money under the condition that he
will receive for every measure the eighth part of a measure, or for every
solidusone siliqua,as interest, must, by all means, return the land or anything
else which he has received by way of pledge. If he should collect anything more
than what is above stated he shall absolutely lose his claim.
17. The Emperor Philip to Euxena.
If your mother encumbered her land to her creditor under the condition that he
could gather the crops instead of receiving interest; this agreement cannot be
rescinded under the pretext that the value of the crops obtained amounted to
more than the interest, because of the uncertainty what the value of the crops
would be.
18. The Same to Castor.
In order to dispose of the differences of the ancient law, it has been decided
after careful deliberation that interest which was not due can be recovered,
even if it was not paid before the principal, and on this account could not be
credited upon it, but was paid after the creditor had received the principal.
19. The Same to Hyrenia.
After issue has been joined, tender the principal of the debt with the legal
interest to your creditors, and if they refuse to accept the money, deposit it
sealed up in some public place, in order to avoid the payment of legal
interest. In this instance, a public place must be understood to be either a
sacred temple, or one in which a competent judge, after having been applied to,
may decide that the money shall be deposited. When this has been accomplished,
the debtor shall be released from liability, and the right of the creditor to
the pledges abolished; as the Servian Action plainly states that pledges cannot
be held if the money has been paid, or the creditor is to blame for this  not
having been done.
This rule should also be observed in the transportation of money, for a
praetorian action will lie in favor of the creditor for its collection, not
against the debtor (unless he has received it), but against the depositary.
20. The Same to JElius.
Relief is granted to mandators and trustees by the Sacred Constitutions, which
forbid interest to be collected on money lent beyond a certain rate, and you
can avail yourself of them if you are sued either as mandators or trustees.
21. The Same to Chresimus.
If you agreed to pay interest and gave a pledge as security, and the money was
counted out to you, and either afterwards, or before making payment, you did
not indicate on what part of the debt you wished credit to be given, your
creditor will have the right to credit the payment which you made upon the
interest.
22. The Same to Carinus.
When pledges have been delivered, interest which could not have been collected
without stipulations can be retained under the agreement; but as you state that
there was no contract of this kind made, but that only a certain sum was agreed
to be paid as a penalty, you perceive that, by the rule of law, nothing more
can be collected, and that you will be compelled to surrender the pledges.
23. The Same to Jason.
Where oil, or any other products of the soil are lent, the uncertainty of their
value allows an increase of interest to be added to the quantity.
24. The Same to Glaucia.
If your mother is of legal age, and has transacted your business, as she was
obliged to use all proper diligence, she can be compelled to pay interest on
your money which she is proved to have had charge of.
25. The Emperor Constantine to the People,
We order that legal interest can be paid or promised for gold, silver, and
clothing, where the loan is evidenced by a note.
26. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Prsetorian Prefect.
We order that those who have been barred in a principal, a personal, or an
hypothecary action, by the prescription of thirty or forty years, cannot raise
any question with reference to interest, crops, or any time which has expired,
under the pretext that they desire interest to be paid to them only for the
time not included in the thirty or forty years which have elapsed, on the
ground that their rights of action arise each year. For the principal action no
longer existing, it is entirely unnecessary for the judge to take cognizance of
any question relating either to the interest or the crops.
(1) We considered it necessary to promulgate a new and general law regulating
the amount of interest, as We think the ancient law on this subject to be
severe and extremely burdensome. Therefore,
We order that illustrious persons, as well as those of higher rank, shall not
be permitted to stipulate for interest exceeding the rate of four per cent,
whether the contract be for a large or a small amount. Bankers, and those who
conduct any lawful business, shall be limited in their stipulations to eight
per cent. With reference to contracts for the transportation of coin, or for
loans at interest of other articles than money, We order that it shall not be
lawful to stipulate for, or to exceed the rate of twelve per cent, although
this was permitted by the ancient laws. Other persons, however, can only
stipulate for interest at six per cent, and this rate of interest can, under no
circumstances, be exceeded in any of those cases in which interest is
ordinarily collected without a stipulation; and no judge shall be permitted to
increase the prescribed rate on account of any custom which may be observed in
that part of the country.
If anyone should violate the provisions of this constitution, he shall not be
entitled to any action to collect interest over and above the legal rate, and
if he should receive it, he shall be compelled to credit it on the principal;
and creditors are forbidden to deduct or retain any of the money lent at
interest under the pretext of siliquteor sportulse,or for any other reason
whatsoever. If anything -of this kind should be done, the amount of the
original debt shall be diminished by the sum that the creditor has received, so
that he shall be prohibited from collecting this portion of the debt, as well
as the interest. With a view to preventing dishonest schemes of creditors who,
being forbidden by this law to stipulate for higher interest, make use of other
persons for this purpose, who are not prohibited from doing so, We order that
if anything of this kind should be attempted, the interest shall be computed as
would have been done if the person who made use of the other himself had
concluded the stipulation, and in this instance We decree that the oath shall
be tendered.
27. The Same to Menna, Prsetorian Prefect.
For the purpose of disposing of the improper interpretation which certain
persons have applied to the law by which We have established the rate of
interest, We order that those who have stipulated for a higher rate before the
promulgation of that law shall reduce their claims in accordance with the one
prescribed by it, from the time when the law was published; but that up to that
date they shall have the right to collect interest in accordance with the tenor
of the stipulation.
(1) We by no means permit more than double interest to be collected, not even
where pledges have been given to the creditor to secure the debt, under which
circumstances certain ancient laws authorized . more than double the interest
to be collected.
We decree that this rule shall be observed in all bona fidecontracts, and in
all other cases in which interest can be collected.
28. The Same to Demosthenes, Prsetorian Prefect.It was provided by the ancient
laws, but not explicitly enough, that interest on interest could not be
collected from debtors; for if it was
permitted to add it to the principal and stipulate for interest on the entire
amount, what difference would it make for the debtors from whom interest on
interest was actually collected? Certainly, this difference does not exist in
the things themselves, but only in the phraseology, and therefore We clearly
provide by this law that no one shall be permitted to add interest to the
principal, either for past or future time, or to stipulate for interest to be
paid upon it. When, however, this law is obeyed, interest will always remain
interest, and there will be no augmentation of other interest, and the only
accrual will be what is derived from the original principal.
TITLE XXXIII. CONCERNING MARITIME LOANS.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Honoratus.
It is clear that money transported by sea, which is at the risk of the
creditor, should be exempt from the law relating to interest only until the
ship has arrived at her destination.
2. The Same to Chosimania.
As you state that you have lent money under the condition that it shall be
repaid in the Imperial City of Rome, and allege that the uncertainty of the
risk due to the perils of navigation has not been assumed by you, there is no
doubt that you are not entitled to collect interest above the legal rate on the
money loaned.
3. The Same to Junia.
As you state that you have negotiated a maritime loan under the condition that
after the voyage, which your debtor stated that he was about to make to Africa,
the ship having anchored in the harbor of the Salonitanians, he agreed to pay
you the money, so that you would only bear the risk of the voyage to Africa,
and that through the fault of your debtor the course of the vessel was not
directed towards the place agreed upon, and, he having purchased unlawful
merchandise, the cargo of the ship was confiscated by the Treasury, the rule of
public law does not permit that you should bear the loss of the merchandise
which is stated was not caused by a tempest, but was due to the inveterate
avarice and unlawful boldness of your debtor.
4. The Same to Eucharistus.
The loss of money during its transport by sea, when it was not lent at the risk
of the creditor, does not render the debtor liable before the ship arrives at
her destination, but the debtor will not be released from the responsibility
for loss by shipwreck, where no agreement of this kind was made.
TITLE XXXIV.
CONCERNING THE ACTION ON DEPOSIT, AND THE COUNTER
ACTION.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Mestenus.
Where, through an attack by robbers or some other accident, certain ornaments
deposited with a person who was killed are lost, the heir of him who received
the deposit will not be responsible, as he is only liable for fraud or gross
negligence; unless it was otherwise agreed upon. If, however, under the pretext
of robbery having been committed, or of some other accident, the property held
by the heir, or of which he has fraudulently relinquished possession, is not
returned, the action of deposit, as well as that for the production of
property, and one for the recovery of the same, will lie.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Celsus.
In the action of deposit, as in other bona fideactions, interest is usually
calculated from the day when the party is in default.
3. The Same to Austerus.
If you bring the action of deposit against him, you will not unreasonably
demand that he pay you interest, for he should congratulate himself that you do
not bring the action of theft, as anyone who knowingly and designedly, and
without the consent of the owner, converts to his own use property which has
been deposited with him, becomes guilty of the crime of theft.
4. The Same to Timocrates.
When anyone who has received money on deposit makes use of it, there is no
doubt that he should pay interest. Where, however, he is sued in the action of
deposit, judgment is only rendered for the amount of the principal, and you
cannot bring another suit for the interest, as there are not two actions, one
for the principal and the other for the interest, but only one; and where
judgment has been rendered in it, a renewal of the action will be barred by the
exception on the ground of res judicata.
5. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus to Claudian.
As you allege that you have deposited certain documents with your adversary in
order that you may receive payment of the remaining money due for rent, if you
have complied with what was agreed upon, you can bring suit to recover the
property sequestered. Even though the said documents should not be returned to
you, if you have paid all that was due under the contract to the person from
whom you rented the premises, you will be protected by the said payment.
6. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Alexander.
He with whom you allege that the two parties to the compromise have deposited
the evidence of the same, or other documents, must observe the condition under
which he received them.
7. The Same to Atticus.
Your claim does not conform to the rules of law, for if you have charge of a
sum of money, and lent it to others, the instrument by which you acknowledge
that it is to be repaid to you is evidence against you, and you are guilty of
dishonesty in refusing to make restitution to the person entitled to it.
8. The Same to Alexander.
If anyone who has received a deposit of money from you lends it either in your
own name or that of someone else, it is perfectly clear that he must not only
comply with his contract, but that his heirs will be liable to you. No action,
however, will lie in your favor against the person who received the money,
unless the actual sum is in existence, for then you can avail yourself of the
action for recovery against the possessor.
9. The Same to Menophyllus and Others.
As an estate represents the person of the former owner, you can sue the heirs
of the depositary before the Governor of the province for property which was
deposited with him in good faith by a slave belonging to the estate, before you
succeeded your father.
10. The Same, and the Caesars, to Septima.
Where anyone does not return a deposit, and is sued, and has judgment rendered
against him in his own name, he will be compelled to make restitution, and runs
the risk of being branded with infamy.
11. The Emperor Justinian to Demosthenes.
When anyone receives money or other property as a deposit, and refuses to
surrender it to him who deposited it, he can be compelled by all legal means to
return it immediately, and cannot plead any set-off, deduction, or exception of
fraud, to avoid doing so, on the ground that he himself has certain personal,
real or hypothecary causes of action against him who deposited the property, as
he did not receive the deposit under the condition that he could retain it for
what had not been paid, so that a contract entered into in good faith would end
in perfidy.
Where, however, property was deposited by both parties with one another, the
impediment of set-off does not arise in this case either, but the property or
money deposited by each of them must be returned as soon as possible without
the interposition of any obstacle, beginning with the one who first demands it,
and afterwards his legal rights of action shall be restored to him unimpaired.
This should take place (as has already been stated) when the deposit has been
made by one of the parties, and a set-off is claimed by the other; so that all
legal rights remaining unimpaired, the property or the money deposited may be
returned in its original condition.
(1) When, however, notice in writing, which was not inspired by deceit or
fraud, is sent by a third party to the depositary directing him
not to return the deposit, and the latter states this under oath, he who made
the deposit, after having furnished good security that he will defend the case,
shall be entitled to recover the property deposited without delay.
Extract from Novel 88, Chapter I. Latin Text.
It has, however, already been provided that no outside person can forbad a
depositary to return the property, and if this is done, he who made the
deposit, though technically in possession, can be sued by him who was
responsible for the prohibition. But if the law should be violated, and any
loss be sustained by the person who suffered violence, he who prohibited the
return of the deposit shall be required to make it good, and shall also be
liable for interest at four per cent from the time when issue was joined. He,
also, who prevents a tenant from paying rent, or a public official from
furnishing bread, shall be liable to the same penalty.
12. The Same to John, Praetorian Prefect.
For the purpose of abolishing a superfluous distinction adopted by the
ancients, We decree that if anyone should deposit a certain weight of gold or
silver, either manufactured or in bulk, and appoint several heirs, and one of
them should receive from the depositary the share to which he was entitled, and
another should fail to do so, whether he was prevented by some accidental
circumstance and the depositary afterwards met with misfortune, or the latter
lost the deposit without being guilty of fraud, the co-heir will not be
permitted to proceed against his co-heir and indemnify himself out of his share
for what he himself was unable to obtain; just as if what the said co-heir had
received was owned in common; for there is no doubt that if a certain sum of
money was deposited, and one of the co-heirs should receive his share, he has a
right to it, and the other ought not to claim it.
It does not seem to Us that the one who has received his share of the property
either in bulk, in ingots, or in money, should be liable, and his diligence pay
the penalty for another's negligence; for if the other heir had taken advantage
of the opportune time as his co-heir did, and both had received their shares,
no ground would be left for subsequent alterations.



TITLE XXXV.
CONCERNING THE ACTION OF MANDATE, AND THE COUNTER ACTION.

1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Leonidas.
You can avail yourself of the action on mandate for the collection of both
principal and interest against the person whose business you transacted, when
you have expended your own money in doing so, or have borrowed money from
others for that purpose. You can also apply to the Governor of the province
with reference to the salary promised you by your employer.

2. The Same to Marcellus.
As you state that your father paid a certain sum of money as surety, you are
entitled to an action on mandate by which you cannot only recover the money,
but also the pledges given as security for the obligation.

3. The Same to Germanus.
If your father directed you, being your own master, t6sue his debtors, he
himself could, if present, bring an action against them, just as if he had not
employed you to do so. Therefore, if any proceedings should be instituted by
him for this purpose in court, there is no reason to require them to be set
aside.

4. The Emperor Alexander to Vulneratus.
Even if those who have appointed you their attorney to conduct their cases on
appeal should be defeated, if you were not to blame for this, you can bring a
counter action on mandate against them to recover the reasonable expenses which
you incurred in the matter.

5. The Same to Gallianus.
If your sister's husband, whom you have appointed your attorney, is unwilling
to demand for you the possession of the property, you should proceed against
him; and you will probably gain your case if you can prove that you directed
him to bring suit for the possession of the property, and he neglected to do
so.

6. The Emperor Gordian to Socibius.
When anyone becomes surety for a debtor with his consent, the latter can be
sued in an action on mandate after the money has been paid by the surety, or
judgment rendered against him.

7. The Same to Aurelian.
Where, in order to carry out the written directions of the money-broker, you
lent money to the person who delivered you his letter, you will not only have a
right to bring a personal action for recovery against him who received the
borrowed money from you, but also the action on mandate against him whose order
you obeyed.

8. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus, and the Csesar Valerian, to Lucius.
If the father of certain minors directed you to lend money to his slaves, to be
employed for the benefit of his property, and if, in addition to this, you,
under his direction, gave pledges as security, you can sue the minors in the
action on mandate after the death of their father, and enforce the right
attaching to the pledges, if payment should not be made.

9. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Marcellus.
As you allege that your case has been endangered by the act of your attorney,
an action on mandate will lie in your favor against him.

10. The Same to Papius.
If you have appeared either as surety or mandator for the party against whom
you filed your petition, and judgment has not been rendered against you on this
account, you cannot prove that he afterwards began to waste his property to
such an extent as to give you just cause for apprehension, and that, in the
beginning, you assumed the obligation in order to be able to sue him before
payment was made; as it is certain that, by no rule of law, you can compel him
to make payment before you yourself have satisfied the creditor.
Moreover, it is evident that where a trustee or a mandator, being entitled to
an exception, lost his case through an unjust decision of the judge, and,
contrary to good faith, neglected to take an appeal, he cannot bring the action
on mandate.

11. The Same to Gaius.
An attorney will be liable not only for fraud but for negligence, both in cases
where he has transacted business, and where he has undertaken to do so, and to
be responsible not only for money which has been collected under the mandate,
but also for any that had not been collected; and account should be taken of
the expenses which he has incurred in good faith.

12. The Same to Firmus.
As you assert that you stated what should be done with reference to certain
business which you wished to be transacted, it is proper that your attorney
should comply with your directions in good faith. Therefore, if, contrary to
the terms of the mandate, he sold the tract of land belonging to you, and you
did not subsequently ratify the sale, you cannot be deprived of the ownership
of the property.

13. The Same to Zosimus.
It is plainly stated by the law that an attorney is liable for fraud and every
kind of negligence, but not for unforeseen accidents.

14. The Same to Hermianus.
If, in accordance with the mandate of Tripho and Felix, you purchased horses
with your own money, or if, they having been delivered to you in payment by
your own debtor, you voluntarily transferred them to one of the above-mentioned
parties with the consent of both, good faith requires that they, having been
sued in an action on mandate, should comply with their contracts.


15. The Same to Precatius.
A mandate is absolutely terminated by the death of the mandator.


16. The Same to Uranius.
Where money has been given to buy merchandise, and he who received it for that
purpose abuses the confidence of his employer, he will be liable for any damage
sustained by the latter.


17. The Same to Gorgonius.
A salary based upon an uncertain promise cannot be recovered by law.


18. The Same to Tuscianus.
Where payment has been made to the agent by someone who directed money to be
lent, he can properly demand to be reimbursed what he paid by him in whose
behalf he intervened, or his heirs, together with interest, after the party or
parties have been in default..


19. The Same to Eugenius.
You cannot be compelled to pay interest above the legal rate of the price of
property which you received for sale by virtue of a previous mandate; whether
the interest was based on a stipulation or on default, even though pledges are
proved to have been given.


20. The Same to Epagathus.
If you have purchased a right of action contrary to law, you will in vain
demand compliance with such a prohibited agreement; but if you have
gratuitously accepted a mandate, you can legally ask that the bona fideexpenses
incurred be refunded to you.


21. The Emperor Constantine to Volusian, Praetorian Prefect.
In cases of mandate, not only the money which is the especial object of the
action on mandate, but also the risk of loss of reputation is at stake; for
anyone who is the owner, and has control of his own property, does not transact
all his business, but the greater portion of it, according to his own will. The
affairs of others must, however, be attended to with the greatest care, and
nothing connected with their administration which is neglected or improperly
done is free from blame.


22. The Emperor Anastasius to Eustaehius, Prsetorian Prefect.
By two different reports which have been made to Us, We have ascertained that
certain individuals, being desirous of obtaining the property and fortunes of
others, have exerted themselves to have rights of action assigned to them by
third parties, and in this way litigants are subjected to many annoyances; and
as it is certain that, so far as undoubted obligations are concerned, men are
more desirous of claiming their own rights than of transferring them to others,
We order by this law that hereafter attempts of this kind shall be prohibited.
There is no doubt that those should be considered the purchasers of the rights
of action of others who desire assignments of this kind to be made to them, so
that if anyone, after having paid money, should obtain such an assignment, he
shall only be permitted to bring the actions which he has purchased to the
extent of the amount of money which he has paid, even though the term "sale"
has been inserted in the instrument evidencing the assignment; with the
exception, however, of such assignments of rights of action referring to an
estate
which are usually made between heirs, and those which either a creditor or a
party in possession of the property of another has received, either in the
discharge of a debt, or on account of the protection and care of property which
has been entrusted to him, as well as those made between legatees or
beneficiaries of a trust, to whom either debts, rights of action, or other
property has been left, for these things are often necessary.
The purchaser of a lawsuit does not come under this rule (as has been
previously stated), but is one who acquires the rights of action of another by
the payment of money. Where, however, an assignment is made as a donation, all
persons are hereby informed that in such a case there is no ground for the
application of this rule, but that the ancient laws must be observed; so that
not only the assignments for the causes excepted and enumerated above, but also
such as have been made, or are to be made, may acquire all the force of rights
of action assigned without any restriction.


23. The Emperor Justinian to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
A constitution which abounded in humanity and benevolence was promulgated by
the most just Emperor Anastasius, of Divine memory, to the effect that no one
should become liable for the debt of another by an assignment made to him, and
that nothing more could be recovered from a debtor than what he had paid to the
party making the assignment, except in certain cases which are distinctly
specified in this same law. As, however, those engaged in acquiring lawsuits
are not inclined to observe this beneficent regulation, but devise means to
evade it by transferring a certain part of the debt which was sold to another
creditor afterwards, and assigning the remaining portion as a donation, We, for
the purpose of generally confirming the Constitution of Anastasius, do hereby
decree that it shall not be lawful for any person to dispose of any portion of
a debt by a sale, and then transfer the remainder as a donation; but if the
party in question desires to absolutely donate the entire debt, and to transfer
the rights of action as a donation, he shall not receive money secretly and
with clandestine artifice, in order to publicly effect the pretended donation,
but he shall make it at all times absolutely and without any pretense, for We
do not prohibit assignments of this kind.
(1) When, however, anyone attempts to perform some act secretly and receives
money, and sells a part of the rights of action, and pretends to donate the
remainder either to the person who has purchased the other part of the same, or
to someone else who has been introduced for that purpose (as We have learned is
frequently done), We absolutely annul all corrupt schemes of this kind, so that
the purchaser, cannot receive more than he himself has actually paid under the
contract; but that all over and above this amount which was transferred by a
fictitious donation cannot be collected by either party, so that neither he who
assigned the rights of action nor he to whom they were transferred shall obtain
any profit or reward, or will be entitled to bring any action either against
the debtor or his property.
(2) If, however, any person should pretend to have made a donation of the
entire debt, and should receive something secretly as a consideration, in this
instance he can only collect what he is proved to have lent, and when this has
been paid by the debtor, neither the latter nor his property can be molested by
virtue of this pretended donation.
(3) This salutary remedy was provided by Anastasius during his reign, for the
benefit of debtors, but, notwithstanding this justice, there were men who were
shrewd enough to think it could be evaded. But lest We may appear to
countenance an enactment too severe for the benevolence of our times, We decree
that the present law shall only be applicable to future cases, and that
everything which has been devised against the Constitution of Anastasius shall
hereafter be annulled by this Our Law.



TITLE XXXVI.
CONCERNING A SLAVE WHO HAS DIRECTED A STRANGER TO PURCHASE HIM.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Dionyna.
If a slave should request a stranger to purchase him, even though it may not be
believed that a right of action on mandate will arise on account of the act of
the slave (because a freeman cannot give such a mandate), nor on account of the
master, as the act of anyone who orders another to purchase something from
himself is void; still, for the excellent reason that this is not done in order
that a right of action on mandate may arise, but that such an action will lie
on account of the mandate contained in another contract, it has been decided
that an obligation of this kind is acquired by the master. Therefore, if,
without the knowledge of your master, you'direct someone to purchase you, and
you furnish money out of your peculiumfor this purpose, and it is paid by the
purchaser, you can, by no means, acquire freedom by an act of this kind. For if
you, being a female slave, have not been either delivered or manumitted, it is
settled that your master will have the right to avail himself of the counter
actions of mandate and purchase, to recover the price. It is, in fact, left to
his choice either to recover you his slave, or the price for which you were
sold, for as the money was paid out of the peculium,which belonged to him, it
could not release the purchaser from liability for the obligation.
TITLE XXXXXXVVIIII..CONCERNING THE ACTION OF PARTNERSHIP.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Aurelius.
It has been decided that a partnership can be contracted where one of the
parties furnished money and the other labor.
2. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Pantonius.
-As you allege that you and your patron have purchased a field together, if
both you and he have been placed in possession, the rule of law requires that
the ownership of said land shall belong to you conjointly. However, as you say
that the price as well as all the expenses have been paid by you, and that your
partner has not contributed his. share, you can, by an action of partnership,
recover whatever he should have paid on this account.
3. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Victorinus.
As good faith should prevail in partnership contracts, it is demanded by the
rules of equity that the profits should be equally divided between the
partners; and if the Governor of the province should find that your father
belonged to a partnership organized for the working of salt-pits, and died
before having received his share of the common profits, he will order that
portion of them to which you are actually entitled to be paid to you.
4. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Celer.
If it was agreed between you and Favia that a division of all the property to
which you are entitled under the law of partnership, or under a stipulation for
compromise, should be made equally between you, the division will be valid; and
it makes no difference whether the person obligated executed a will, or died
intestate.
5. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Theodore.
We decree that a partnership shall last as long as the consent of the parties
to its continuance exists. Hence, if you have acquired a right of action on
partnership, you will not be prevented from bringing it before a judge having
jurisdiction.
6. The Emperor Justinian to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
It was doubted among the ancients whether a partnership could be formed under a
condition, for instance, that the partnership should be formed if Such-and-Such
a person should become consul. In order that hereafter no doubt may arise on
this point, as was the case in former times, We decree that a partnership
cannot only be formed absolutely, but also conditionally, for the wishes of
persons who make legal contracts should by all means be considered.
7. The Same to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
For the purpose of removing the doubts of the ancient authorities, We decree
that the curator of an insane person shall have power to dissolve a partnership
of which the insane person is a member, and renounce all connections with his
partners, if he should see fit to do so. And We grant him lawful authority,
just as in all other contracts, and permit him in a case of this kind to
provide in a proper manner for the benefit of the said insane person.
TITLE XXXVIII.
«
CONCERNING THE CONTRACT OF PURCHASE AND SALE.
1. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus to Paulus.Sales which are made in some
other place than that in which the property is situated are not, for this
reason, considered void.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Avitus.
It is evident that consent is required for purchase and sale, and that an
insane person is not capable of consent. There is no doubt, however, that
insane persons, who are more than twenty-five years of age, can make sales and
any other contracts during their lucid intervals.
3. The Same to Valeria.
When a fictitious contract of sale is made in order to effect a donation, it
will be of no force or effect. If you have placed anyone in possession of
property under the pretext of a sale, but really as a donation, in
consideration that he will support you, such a donation, when perfected, cannot
readily be rescinded, and it is proper for you to comply with the condition
which you stated was imposed when you donated your property.
4. The Same to Lucian.
You say that you purchased from the heir of the donor the property which she
gave you, but you should be aware that your title to the same cannot be
doubled; hence you have made your purchase in vain, as you had already become
the owner by gift and delivery, and could obtain no additional advantage,
unless it is proved that the title did not vest in you by virtue of the
donation. And if, as you allege, all the property of the donor was given and
delivered to you, a sale made by the son of his mother's property can be
maintained, even if the donation was perfected, as the son could set this aside
by filing a complaint that the will was inofficious.
5. The Same to Gratia.
As a guardian himself is forbidden to purchase openly and in good faith any of
the property of his ward which can be sold, there is much more reason why his
wife should not be permitted to do so.
6. The Same to Lucretius.
If Gaudentius transferred the ownership of a slave to your mother by a sale,
and without fraud, her rights are in no way prejudiced for the reason that
marriage and divorce are alleged to have afterwards taken place between them.
Therefore you will not be prevented from bringing an action to recover the
slave, if you prove that you have succeeded your mother.
7. The Same to Piso.
If your mother falsely asserts that she received as a donation a female slave
whom she herself had previously bought from her second
husband, the pretense of this simulated donation can neither confirm her
ownership nor deprive her of it.
8. The Same to Diogenes.
If you have actually sold your vineyard, and not given it away, and the
purchase-money has not been counted out to you, you will be entitled to an
action to recover the price of the same, but not one to recover any articles
which you may have donated.
9. The Same to Severus.
A purchase or a sale made without a price is void. If, however, the price has
not been paid, but possession has been delivered to the purchaser, a contract
of this kind is not considered invalid; and therefore the person who made the
purchase is none the less entitled to possession because he refuses to pay the
price which he had agreed to give. When, however, delivery follows the sale of
a tract of land made by way of donation, as no action will lie for the recovery
of the price, the donation is perfected.
10. The Same to Georgius.
If your mother bought her own land, believing that it was a part of the estate
of your father, as the purchase of one's own property will not stand, and you
allege that this one is fictitious, an agreement of this kind cannot change the
truth, or prejudice your mother's rights.
11. The Same to Paterius.
The prayer of the petitioner to be permitted to purchase or sell property
against the consent of the party in possession of the same is not founded on
just grounds.
12. The Same to Paternus.
A purchase is none the less complete for the reason that the purchaser did not
receive a surety, or that an instrument showing that the property was
unoccupied, was not drawn up; for anyone who takes possession with the consent
of the vendor is legally the possessor. Where, however, it is proved that the
price has not been paid, it can be demanded; for the desire of one of the
parties to withdraw from the contract, although manifested immediately after it
has been entered into, will not rescind it if it was executed with the consent
of all concerned.
13. The Same to Julian.
The obligation of a contract for purchase or sale, which is drawn up under the
condition that it will be dependent upon the will of the vendor or purchaser,
is void, because it does not necessarily bind the contracting parties.
Therefore neither the owner nor anyone else can be compelled to sell his own
property under an agreement of this kind.
14. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Fabian, Prefect of
Illyria and Italy.
Near relatives were formerly permitted to exclude strangers from a purchase, so
that persons could not voluntarily dispose of property which they desired to
sell; but, for the reason that this seemed to cause serious injury (which was
veiled by a vain pretext of honesty) by compelling men to alienate their
property against their wishes, the former law being abolished, everyone can
now, according to his own inclination, either seek or accept a purchaser,
unless the law especially prohibits certain persons from doing so.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of Tatian and
Symmachus, 391.
15. The Emperor Justinian to Julian, Prtetorian Prefect.
A serious doubt arose among the ancient authorities with reference to contracts
of sale, where anyone made a purchase under the condition that the property
should be sold for the price at which another would say that it was worth. We,
intending to dispose of this doubt, do hereby decree that when an agreement of
this kind, namely, that the sale shall be for the price that a third party may
put upon the property is entered into, the sale shall be void, if made under
such a condition; and when he who was mentioned states the price, and it is
paid in accordance with his estimate, the sale shall take effect, whether the
contract was reduced to writing or not; for where an agreement of this kind is
reduced to writing, it will, in accordance with the provisions of Our Laws, be
in all respects complete and absolute.
If, however, the person referred to should be unwilling or unable to fix the
price, then the sale will be void, no price having been determined upon; and
that neither oneiromancy nor divination shall, under any circumstances,
hereafter be resorted to, to ascertain whether the contracting parties who made
such an agreement selected any certain person, or relied upon the judgment of a
reputable citizen; for the reason that it is impossible to place any confidence
in such expedients, and We abolish them by the present law.
We decree that this rule shall also apply to leases of the same character.
TITLE XXXIX.
CONCERNING THE INHERITANCE OR SALE OF RIGHTS OP
ACTION.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Geminius.
It is absolutely certain that where an estate is sold in the name of the
Treasury, the purchaser is liable for the debts, and the Treasury is not liable
to the creditors of the estate.
2. The Emperor Antoninus to Florian.
The rule of law requires that you answer the creditors of the estate, as well
as the legatees or beneficiaries of trusts who may bring
actions against you; and that, on the other hand, you, in your turn, can
proceed against the person to whom you sold the estate. It will, however, be
too late to ask him to furnish you security, as this was not included in the
contract at the time when the estate was sold. For even though someone made the
purchase under the condition that he would satisfy the creditors of the estate,
still, if he is unwilling, he cannot be compelled to accept actions brought on
account of the estate.
3. The Emperor Alexander to Timotheus.
The sale of a claim can be made, even without the knowledge or consent of the
party against whom suit is brought.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof February, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and .ZElianus.
4. The Same to Diogenes.
He who is not yet certain of the value of the estate, but, having been
persuaded by the purchaser, sold it for a small sum of money, cannot be sued in
a bona fideproceeding, and compelled to deliver the property, or assign his
rights of action, for he can also legally bring suit to recover the property. ,
5. The Same to Onesimus.
The purchaser of an estate, after the rights of action have been transferred to
him, must make use of the same ones which the person whose place he occupies
was entitled to; even though it was agreed that the praetorian rights of action
against the debtors of the estate should be assigned to the purchaser.
6. The Same to Pomponius.
Anyone who has sold you an estate still remains the owner of the same until he
delivers you the property, and hence by selling it to others he can transfer
the ownership. But as he has broken the faith of the contract, if he should be
sued in an action on purchase, he can be compelled to indemnify you for any
loss which you may have sustained.
7. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Manassa.
After it was settled that the contracts of debtors could be given in pledge, it
seemed to be the rule that equitable actions could be granted to the creditor
himself who made the demand (as has already been decided) after the sale of the
claim.
8. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Julian.
By the sale of the claim the ownership of the property encumbered does not pass
to the purchaser, but he either is appointed an attorney in his own behalf, or
an equitable action, as in the case of a' creditor, is granted in accordance
with what has already been established.
9. The Emperor Justinian to John, Praetorian Prefect.
It is a certain and unquestionable rule of law that anyone who has purchased a
real action can avail himself of his right, just as he who
has purchased a personal action can do, and that he will be permitted to
proceed legally in his own name. For as the designation is a general one, and
is applicable to both real and personal actions, and among the ancient
authorities was used to indicate both, there is no reason why any distinction
should be made between praetorian actions of this kind.
TITLE XL.
WHAT PROPERTY CANNOT BE SOLD, AND WHAT PERSONS ARE FORBIDDEN TO SELL OR
PURCHASE IT.
1. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Faustus, Count of the
Sacred Largesses.
No private person shall have the right to dye either silk or wool with the
colors called blatta, oxyblatta,or hyacinthina,or sell it after it has been
dyed. If anyone should sell wool dyed with the colors aforesaid, he is hereby
notified that he will incur the risk of losing his property and his life.
2. The Same to Toriobandus, Duke of Mesopotamia.
We order, as has already been decreed, that all barbarians, excepting the Count
of Commerce, shall be deprived of the right to purchase silk.
3. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to the Senate and the People.
For the reason that grain destined for the public is said to be sometimes sold
on various coasts, the vendors and purchasers of such merchandise are hereby
informed that they are liable to capital punishment, and that commercial
contracts of this kind made with a view to defrauding the public are
prohibited.
4. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Faustus, Praetorian Prefect.
In order to prevent the grain intended for Our most devoted army from being
appropriated for the benefit of others, We order by this law that anyone who
shall engage in this kind of traffic, if he is of high rank, shall be
proscribed, and incur the loss of all his property, and that persons of
inferior station shall suffer capital punishment.
TITLE XLI. WHAT PROPERTY SHOULD NOT BE EXPORTED.
1. The Emperors Valens and Gratian to Theodore, General of the Army.
No one shall have authority to transport to the country of the barbarians
either wine, oil, or other liquids, either for the purpose of consumption or
for commercial purposes.
2. The Emperor Martian to Aulus, Prsetorian Prefect.
Let no one presume to sell to barbarians of any race whatsoever, who have come
to this City with an embassy, or on any other errand, or in any other city or
place, cuirasses, shields, bows, arrows, double-edged swords, or ordinary
swords; nor shall any darts or any other weapons made of iron, or the
unfinished material for the same be sold to them by any person; for it is
injurious to the Roman Empire, and resembles treason for barbarians, who should
be deprived of them, to be furnished with weapons in order that they may become
more formidable. Therefore, if anyone should in any place sell to foreign
barbarians any kind of arms which have been forbidden by Our laws, We decree
that his entire property shall immediately be confiscated, and that he shall
suffer the penalty of death.
TITLE XLII. CONCERNING EUNUCHS.
1. The Emperor Constantine to Aurelius, Duke of Mesopotamia.
If anyone, after the promulgation of this law, should make any eunuchs in the
Roman Empire, he shall be punished with death; and the slave, as well as the
place where the crime was committed with the knowledge of his master, even
though the latter may feign ignorance, shall be confiscated.
2. The Emperor Leo to Vivian, Prsetorian Prefect.
We order that the ownership of men of the Roman race, who have been made
eunuchs either in a barbarous country or on Roman soil, can, under no
circumstances, be transferred to anyone; and that the severest penalty shall be
inflicted upon those who have dared to commit such an offence, including the
notary who drew up the instrument of sale or of any other kind of alienation;
and he who received the octava,or anything else by way of tax, shall be
subjected to the same penalty. We, however, grant authority to all traders to
buy or sell, wherever they please, eunuchs of barbarous nations who have been
made such outside the boundaries of Our Empire.
TITLE XLIII. CONCERNING FATHERS WHO HAVE SOLD THEIR CHILDREN.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Papiniana.
It is a plain rule of law that children cannot be alienated by their parents,
either through sale, donation, pledge, or in any other way, even under the
pretext of the ignorance of the person who receives them.
2. The Emperor Constantine to the People of the Provinces.If any heartless
person, induced by extreme poverty and want, should sell either his son or
daughter for the purpose of obtaining
means wherewith to live, in a case of this kind the sale shall only be valid
where the purchaser had a right to the service of the person sold, and he who
made the sale, or the one to whom the child was alienated, shall have the right
to restore it to its freeborn condition, provided he tenders its value to the
owner, or furnishes him another slave in its stead.



TITLE XLIV. CONCERNING THE RESCISSION OF A SALE.


1. The Emperor Alexander to Maro.
If your father, having been compelled by force, should sell his house, the sale
will not be valid, because it was not made in good faith, and a purchase made
in bad faith is void. Therefore, having applied in your own name to the
Governor of the province, he will interpose his authority, above all if you
state that you are prepared to refund to the purchaser the price which was
paid.

2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Lupus.
If either you or your father should sell property for less than it is worth,
and you refund the price to the purchasers, it is only just that you should
recover the land which was sold by judicial authority; or, if the purchaser
should prefer to do so, you should receive what is lacking of a fair price. A
lower price is understood to be one which does not amount to half of the true
value of the property.

3. The Same to Martiana.
Good faith does not permit a person, at any time, to repudiate a contract of
sale or purchase made in accordance with law against the consent of either
party, even by virtue of an Imperial rescript. It has frequently been decided
that Our Treasury can make use of this right.
4. The Same to Eudoxius.
For the purpose of rescinding a sale, and proving bad faith, it is not
sufficient for you to state that the land in question has been sold for less
than half the amount for which it was purchased.
5. The Same to Rufus.
If, after application has been made to the Governor of the province, he should
decide that you made the sale of your land because you were deceived by the
fraudulent representations of your adversary, and being aware that fraud is
contrary to the good faith especially required in contracts of this kind, he
must order the sale to be rescinded. If, however, it was perfected by a person
more than twenty-five years of age, you understand that when this was done by
common consent, the sale cannot be set aside.
6. The Same to Gratian.
The reason for which you desire a sale made by common consent to be rescinded
is not a proper one; for although you offer double the
price to the purchaser, still, if he is unwilling, he cannot be compelled to
rescind the sale.
7. The Same to Mucarolus and Other Soldiers.
It is to your interest that the sales legally made should always remain valid.
For if it is readily permitted to rescind a sale, whenever an offer to refund
the purchase-money is made, the result will be that if you should buy anything
either from Our Treasury, or from a private person, with the fruit of your
labors, you can be sued under the same law which you now ask to have a right to
avail yourself of.
8. The Same to Evodia.
If your son should, with your consent, sell a tract of land belonging to you,
and fraud resulting from cunning and treachery should be proved, or the fear of
death, or if some threat of bodily injury should be disclosed, the sale shall
not be considered valid. The sole reason which you give for rescinding the
sale, namely, that the property was disposed of for a little less than its true
value, is not sufficient. If, indeed, you bear in mind the nature of the
contract of sale, and that the purchaser desiring to buy for a lower price, and
the vendor desiring to sell for a higher one, have come to terms after much
contention, the vendor, receding little by little from what he at first
demanded, and the purchaser adding little by little to what he at first
offered, until they finally agree upon the price, you will at once perceive
that neither the good faith which protects contracts of purchase and sale nor
any other reason will suffer an agreement concluded with mutual consent to be
rescinded, because either immediately, or after the amount paid has been
discussed in court, if less than half of the just price was not paid at the
time of the sale, the purchaser had reserved the right to return the property
on condition that the money was refunded.
Given on the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the Caesars.
9. The Same to Domitius.
A contract is not considered to be void where the price of the property was not
counted out in money, but payment was made in cattle, with the consent of the
vendor.
10. The Same to Severus.
The fraud of the purchaser is established by the nature of the act, and not by
the amount of the sum which was paid. - If fraud is proved to have taken place,
the vendor will not have a right to bring an action to recover the property
against the person to whom the purchaser transferred the ownership, but he will
be entitled to one for complete restitution from him with whom he made the
contract.
11. The Same to Magna.
The vendor can make a complaint for fraud committed by the purchaser, which was
concealed from him at the time of the execution
of the contract, and which he afterwards ascertained, but not when he was aware
of what was being done at the time, and gave his consent to it. Therefore, as
you allege that your father agreed to what was mentioned in the bill of sale,
namely, that a higher price should be paid than it was originally agreed that
the property should be sold for, he will, in vain, complain of having been
swindled on this ground. (1) Where, indeed, it is proved that the price agreed
upon was not paid, or if it was provided, through an error of fact, that
another debt should be set off against it, a demand can legally be made for
its. payment.
12. The Same to Antiochus.
The sale of the land in question is none the less valid because you allege that
you disposed of it because you had a pressing need for the money in order to
satisfy a public claim, and did not sell it for less than it was worth.
Therefore, while abstaining from any unlawful demands, you had better demand
the price, if it has not been paid in full.
13. The Same Emperors and Cs&sars to Nica.
If you, when you were more than twenty-five years of age, sold a tract of land,
good faith does not permit the sale to be rescinded by you for the sole reason
that your father-in-law notified the purchaser not to buy it.
14. The Same Emperors and Caesars to Basilica.
Estates having been sold upon condition that the person who brought them should
pay what the vendor owed to the State, and payment having been made by the
latter, he can bring suit for the amount to which he is entitled, but the
contract shall not be declared void for the reason that the purchaser did not
comply with his agreement.
15. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Hypa-tius, Prsetorian
Prefect.
If anyone who has attained his majority should sell some lands situated in a
distant country, he  cannot recover the property sold under the pretext that
it was disposed of for a little less than its real value, and he will not be
permitted to cause delay by objections which are without foundation, as, for
instance, to allege that the value of the property was not known to him, as he
should have previously made himself familiar with the value, the advantages,
and the profits of the same.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulship of Merobaudus,
Consul for the second time, and Saturninus.
16. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Ma-gillus, Vicegerent
of Africa.
If the necessity imposed by public liabilities compels anyone oppressed by the
weight of his debts to relinquish his property, the
nature of the same and the amount of the income derived from it shall be
estimated in order that there may be no ground for fraud under the pretext of a
public sale, so that, it having been sold at too low a price, the collector of
taxes will obtain more from the favor which he grants than the debtor will from
the money which he receives. Those shall afterwards hold the property by a
perpetual title, legally obtained by the sale, who paid to the Treasury as much
as would have been given by a private person; for it is extremely unjust that
where the property of another is sold as a favor, the Treasury should obtain
but little, and the debtor lose everything.
17. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Messala.
Those who, in order to avoid public charges to which they are liable, take to
flight, or secretly make fraudulent contracts, are hereby notified that such
schemes will not benefit them to any extent, and that if the purchaser is aware
of their flight he shall be fined a sum equal to the price which he paid.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof September, during the fifth Consulate of
Theodore, 399.
18. The Emperors Arcadius, Honorius, and Theodosius to Nes-torius, Count of
Private Affairs.
The Palatines are hereby informed that authority is refused them to purchase
clothing, gold, silver, or slaves, whenever they are sold by Our subjects,
under penalty of losing the price which they paid.
TITLE XLV.
WHEN IT is PERMITTED TO REFUSE TO COMPLY WITH A CONTRACT OF SALE.
1. The Emperor Gordian to Rufinus.
When a contract of purchase and sale has not yet begun to be carried into
effect, it can be rescinded with the acquiescence of both parties, for what has
been agreed to by common consent can be dissolved in the same way. However,
after delivery has been made, mere consent will not rescind a sale, unless a
contract similar to the first one is drawn up, which retroactively puts an end
to the transaction.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Felix.
It is established that a purchase and sale which has not begun to be executed
can be rescinded by an agreement, and the consent of the-parties. Therefore, if
gold has been given by way of earnest money, you can recover it in accordance
with the terms of the agreement. Where, however, you have paid part of the
price, you will rather be entitled to an action to recover whatever the vendor
is required to furnish you under the contract of sale than the amount of the
price which he paid.
TITLE XLVI.
WHERE A SALE is MADE ON ACCOUNT OF PUBLIC CONTRIBUTIONS.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Maternus.
A sale should not be revoked on account of the non-payment of taxes, whether
the former owner tenders the purchase-money, or a creditor interposes his right
of hypothecation or pledge, as the claim, for the taxes is preferred, and all
the property of the party in default is liable to it on the ground of priority.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Plotius.
If you have purchased lands taken from their owners on account of the non-
payment of any taxes or of some balance due which were sold with the observance
of the legal formalities, in good faith, and for a fair price with the
permission of the Governor, by persons responsible for the collection of taxes,
a sale made on account of public claims of this kind cannot be set aside.
Where, however, the sale did not take place by the authority of the Governor
previously obtained, the laws do not consider it to be valid, and therefore
what was illegally done should be revoked in such a way that the payment of the
taxes may, under all circumstances, be secured. All these things should be done
in the presence of the person who you allege is the purchaser.
3. The Emperor Constantine to the Governor Faustus.
If anyone should buy at public sale a tract of land, a slave, or any other
property, on account of default of the payment of taxes, or because of the
seizure of clothing, gold, or silver which was due and payable annually and the
debtor has been summoned and interrogated in court with reference to his
failure to pay, We order that the sale shall be perpetually confirmed. If,
however, the party interested is a minor, it is necessary that some person who
can make a lawful defence should be present at the sale, and it makes no
difference whether what was due was to be collected by Our attorney, or the
Governor of the province.
Given on the day before the Idesof December, during the Consulate of Felicianus
and Titian, 337.
TITLE XLVII.
LAND CANNOT BE PURCHASED WITHOUT THE PAYMENT OF TAXES OR BALANCES WHICH ARE
DUE.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Capito.
An action will not lie in your favor against your stepmother and your father
under an agreement which you allege was entered into between them by which she
gave a tract of land as dowry, and agreed to pay the taxes to which it was
liable, and this is the case even if the
agreement is proved to have contained a stipulation. If, however, the land has
been appraised, in order, as was stated in the instrument, that it might be
given by way of dowry, the action on sale will not lie, although the agreement
may be enforced.
Given on the Nonesof December, during the third Consulate of the same Emperor,
Consul for the third time, and Dio, 230.
2. The Emperor Constantine to Marcellus.
While examining the question of public contributions with reference to
provisions, We have ascertained that the principal reason why the tax due is
not paid is because certain persons, taking advantage of the temporary
necessities of others, purchase lands under the condition of not paying any
taxes which might be due on them to the Treasury, and possessed them free from
all encumbrance; therefore it has been decided that if it should be proved that
anyone had made a contract of this kind, and had obtained possession under this
condition, he shall not only be liable for the ordinary taxes on the land which
was purchased, but also for all these remaining unpaid, and as the person who
bought it is required to pay the taxes thereon, no one shall be permitted to
purchase or sell any property free from tax.
Given at Agrippina, on the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Constantine,
Consul for the fifth time, and Licinius, 319.
Extract from Novel 17, Chapter Vill, Section 1.
The vendor can, however, assume the payment of any taxes, if, after examination
made before delivery, the purchaser should be found to be insolvent, for then
the vendor will be compelled to acknowledge that the transfer was made at his
risk, so far as the payment of taxes to the Treasury is concerned.
3. The Emperor Julian to Secundus, Prsetorian Prefect.
All persons shall be liable for the public taxes imposed upon the land in their
possession, and they can obtain no advantage from agreements to the contrary,
where either the vendor or the donor himself desires to assume the payment of
the taxes under the terms of an unlawful contract, even if the name of the new
owner has not yet been placed upon the tax register, but that of the former
proprietor of the land still remains, the parties themselves having been guilty
of dissimulation in order that those not in possession might be compelled to
pay instead of the actual possessors.
Given at Antioch on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate
of Julian, Consul for the fourth time, and Sallust, 363.
TITLE XLVIII.
CONCERNING THE RISKS AND ADVANTAGES ATTACHING TO PROPERTY SOLD.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Apollonius.
After a sale has been perfected, every advantage and disadvantage which can
affect the property disposed of will concern the purchaser,
for the vendor, on his part, is only liable for what may cause eviction, and
originated during the time preceding the sale; hence if he is notified to
appear at a proceeding of this kind, judgment will be rendered against him in
the presence of the purchaser.
2. The Same to Julian.
As it is proper that wine-jars should be sold at a fixed price, before they
have been delivered, and while the sale was as yet imperfect, the risk of
having the wine changed will not be assumed by the purchaser, provided he was
not in default in causing it to be measured. As, however, you allege that all
the wine deposited in the warehouses was sold without having been measured, and
the keys delivered to the purchaser, any loss which ensued from its having been
changed after the sale was concluded must be assumed by the latter.
These rules not only apply to wine, but also oil, grain, and other articles of
this kind which have been sold and have become deteriorated or entirely
destroyed.
3. The Same to Diaphania.
It is an established rule of law that the fraud of the vendor cannot injure a
bona fidepurchaser.
4. The Emperor Gordian to Silurus.
When an agreement as to the price was made in a verbal contract between
purchaser and vendor, and the vendor did not delay in delivering the property
sold, there is no doubt that it will be at the risk of the purchaser.
5. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Leontius.
As you state that the property sold was consumed by fire, and there was no
condition which suspended the sale, you were not liable for the articles
destroyed.
6. The Same to Cerulus.
The loss by death of the female slave who was sold must be borne by the
purchaser, and not by the vendor, even if it occurred before the slave was
delivered, provided the vendor was not in default; and as the slave did not die
on account of some already existing defect the purchaser cannot legally refuse
to pay the price.
TITLE XLIX.
CONCERNING THE ACTIONS OF PURCHASE AND SALE. 1. The Emperor Antoninus to
Deliana.
Bring an action of sale against the person to whom you sold the land, for you
are not entitled to one in remagainst the purchaser, who is personally liable
to you.
2. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus, and the Csssar Valerian to Domitian.
You can bring the action of sale against your adversary for the purpose of
recovering the balance of the price. You cannot be opposed by having a set-off
pleaded against you, as if you were indebted to one another; and if you should
prove that, in a bona fidecontract (on account of which persons over the age of
twenty-five obtain relief through a judge on the ground that fraud has been
committed), you have been led into a plausible error, or have been defrauded by
your adversary, and have acknowledged a debt which, in fact, was not due.
You can also recover by the same action any crops which were gathered before
the sale was contracted, and which were not included in it, but which you
allege were appropriated by the purchaser.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Serpodorus.
A personal action in favor of the contracting parties is the only one which can
be brought under an agreement where earnest money has been given.
4. The Same to Mutian.
If the delivery of the property sold did not, through the obstinacy of the
vendor, take place in accordance with the terms of the contract, the Governor
of the province must see that judgment is rendered against him to the extent of
the interest which the purchaser had in having the sale concluded.
5. The Same to Decima.
The Governor of a province shall compel the purchaser to restore to you a part
of the price with the interest if, after having obtained possession of the
property, he has gathered the crops, and this rule is established because he
has gathered them in favor of minority, even though the purchaser may not have
been in default.
6. The Same to Neractus.
The action of sale (unless it was otherwise agreed in the beginning) will not
readily lie to rescind a sale which has been perfected, but it can be brought
for the purpose of collecting the purchase-money.
7. The Same to Diodorus.
If you sold certain slaves and received the price out of their peculium,which,
in fact, belonged to you without knowing from whence it was derived, the result
will be that you can bring suit to recover the price, as the payment of money
belonging to the vendor does not release-the purchaser from liability.
8. The Same to Eusebius.
If your father should sell a portion of his land, but does not place the
purchaser in possession, it is certain that he will retain all his rights to
said land; and even if the purchaser has paid the tax, as
where delivery has been made, he will still do so, for when a simulated act
takes place it cannot alter the truth. Wherefore, if after application has been
made to the Governor of the province, he should find that neither your father
nor his successors had placed either the purchaser or his heirs in possession
of any part of the property, he will have no hesitation in deciding that no
transfer was made. But if he should learn that you have been sued in an action
on purchase to compel you to place the purchaser in possession, he must then
ascertain whether the price has been paid, and if this has not been done, he
will see that the property is restored to you.
9. The Same to Antipatra.
If it should be stated by the vendor (either knowingly or ignorant-ly) that the
tax on the land sold was less than it was afterwards found to be, suit can be
brought against him for the amount which the purchaser would have been
compelled to add to the price, if he had been aware of this in the first place.
Where, however, he was aware of the actual amount of the tax which was due, he
will have no right of action against the vendor.
10. The Same to Attains.
As you state that the vendor did not deliver you the meat at the time agreed
upon, contrary to the terms of the contract, you can sue him before the
Governor of the province in the action of purchase for the amount of the
interest that you had in having the meat furnished you.
11. The Same to Bucarpia.
Where a vendor has manumitted a female slave delivered to you under a contract
of sale, he cannot bestow freedom upon a slave which belonged to another. If,
however, he manumitted the slave after the sale and before delivery, being
still her owner in accordance with law, he will not be prevented from making
her a Roman citizen, and you will be entitled to a personal action against him
for breach of contract.
12. The Same to Crispinus.
As any loss caused by having wine changed after it has been actually purchased
is at the risk of the purchaser, so he will also be entitled to any advantage
derived from an increase in price. For this reason the terms of a contract must
be observed when wine of a certain kind and quantity is sold, and if it should
not be delivered, an action will lie, not for the price, but for the amount of
the interest which the purchaser had in having it delivered.
13. The Same to Alexander.
After a contract has been legally concluded, it is settled that the profits of
the property will belong to the purchaser, just as he must be responsible for
any encumbrance upon it. The vendor can also, by authority of the judge,
collect not only the price, but also the interest on the same, if it shall be
established that the purchaser is in default.
14. The Same to Rufinus.
The purchaser of slaves can properly demand that a guarantee be furnished for
their delivery, and against their flight, as well as for their health and that
they are not wanderers, or liable to be surrendered by way of reparation for
damages.
15. The Same to Antonius.
A purchaser cannot collect any more than the amount of wheat sold to him, as
stated in the contract, where the vendor is not in default in the delivery.
16. The Same to Cyrillus.
It is well known that after a sale has been perfected, the young of cattle
should be delivered by the purchaser, and the vendor should be reimbursed his
expenses, if they have been incurred in good faith.
17. The Same to Hermianus and Lupus.
When you allege that you have been violently expelled by Nero from lands to
which you deny he is entitled, you show that you have no right of action
against him, for you have obtained possession of the land by sale; and
therefore you must be aware that you should institute proceedings against him
by means of an interdict, or by the Actio permissa.
TITLE L.
WHERE ANYONE HAS PURCHASED PROPERTY FOR ANOTHER,
OR FOR HIMSELF IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER, OR WITH
MONEY BELONGING TO ANOTHER.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Secundinus.
If lands or slaves have been bought with your father's "money, and you assert
that, nevertheless, the purchases were made in your mother's name, you should
not be ignorant that by delivery your mother will become the owner of the
property. It is evident that if you think you have a right to collect the price
paid for said property, because it has been counted out by your mother, you
must sue her in a civil action.
2. The Emperor Alexander to Septima and Others.
If, after your emancipation, your father should deliver to you certain lands
which he purchased in your name when you were under his control, or if you had
been in possession of said lands with his con-, sent, you will acquire the
ownership of the same.
3. The Same to Patrimus.
If the slaves whom you mention have, as you state, been purchased in your name
and in that of your brothers to whom you have succeeded, and have been
delivered to you, although in the bill of sale it is stated
that your mother paid the money for them, you will not be prevented from
recovering them in the ordinary course of law.
4. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus, and the Csesar Valeria/n, to Cyrillus.
Although you inserted the name of your mother-in-law in the bill of sale,
still, if while in possession, you became the owner of the property, you will
have no need to apprehend any annoyance from her on this account, even though
she may have the written contract.
5. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Verus.
You say that, after having purchased a tract of land with your own money, you
only inserted the name of your wife in the contract of sale, and she, taking
advantage of the said contract which had been entrusted to her, claimed the
ownership of the land contrary to good faith. The Governor of the province, in
the exercise of his authority, must provide that the donation of said property
by your wife, who is not the owner of the same, to her daughter, will not
prejudice your right of ownership, and when you prove the truth of the
statements in your petition, he will see that possession is restored to you,
after having made an estimate of the value of the crops.
6. The Same to Dionysius.
It makes a great deal of difference whether you counted out the money when your
wife made the purchase, and possession was delivered to her, or whether the
contract was made in your name, and you subsequently caused that of your wife
to be inserted in the bill of sale. For if your wife purchased the property in
her own name, and it was delivered to her, you will have no right to it, and
you will only be entitled to an action against her for the amount by which you
have become poorer, and she has become richer.
When, however, you yourself purchased the property, and possession was
delivered to you, and the name of your wife was only inserted in the instrument
of sale, what has actually been done is preferable to what has merely been
stated in writing.
But if in the beginning you, while transacting the business of your wife, made
the purchase in her name, you did not acquire the right of action on purchase
against her, as you did not intend to and could not have done so; and therefore
so far as the question involving ownership is concerned, the position of him to
whom possession has been delivered by the owner of the property is preferable.
7. The Same to Gerontius.
As you state that you have bought oil through persons who are transacting your
business, but, after the price was paid, the vendor violated his agreement, you
have certainly acquired a right of action growing out of the purchase, through
the contract of those legally subject to your authority; and the action can
either be brought by you or by anyone whom you may direct.
If, however, persons who were their own masters made this contract in
accordance with your mandate, they themselves have acquired the right of action
on purchase, and therefore you must appear before a competent judge either by
them or by those to whom they gave the mandate, and he will see that your claim
is satisfied in accordance with the good faith which is ordinarily observed in
contracts of this description.
8. The Same to Valentina.
Anyone who has made a purchase with money belonging to another will acquire the
right of action on purchase for himself, and not for him to whom the money
belongs, together with the ownership of the property, if possession was
delivered to him. Therefore, as you state that your cousin bought property with
money owned in common by you both, you will do well to sue him to recover your
money, but you will not be entitled to an action in remagainst him for the
property purchased.
9. The Same to Rufina.
There is nothing to prevent the ownership of property from being transferred to
another than the person who has counted out the money, with the consent of both
of the contracting parties, or, indeed, with only that of the vendor; and for
this reason it is perfectly clear that an agreement of this kind can be made
between persons who are absent, through the agency of a third party, as for
instance, a messenger, or even by means of a letter.
TITLE LI.
CONCERNING THE PROHIBITED ALIENATION AND HYPOTHECATION OF THE PROPERTY OP
OTHERS.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Cantianus.
If it should be proved before the Governor of the province that Julian, without
any right, sold your slaves to persons who knew that they did not belong to
him, he must order the purchasers to restore your slaves to you. If, however,
they were ignorant that this was the case, and the slaves were delivered to
them, the Governor shall order Julian to pay you the price of said slaves.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Gratia.
If you did not give your consent to the sale of your property by your husband,
although you sealed with your own signet the instrument of sale which was
fraudulent, a swindle of this kind will afford no security to the purchaser,
and he can, by no means, avail himself of the rights of usucaption, or
prescription based upon long time.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Valerian.A vendor who succeeds by
hereditary right is not permitted to rescind a sale which was legally made and
perfected, and recover the
ownership of the property; but if she makes a claim in her own right, you can
protect yourself by means of an exception on the ground of fraud, if you prefer
this method; or, in case of eviction, if you do not wish to make use of the
above-mentioned defence, you can bring suit for the value of your interest in
the matter.
4. The Same to Affabilus.
When your mother gave the slaves of your father, who had leased a tract of land
of Philip, to the latter for the payment of debts, and the slaves were obtained
by you through inheritance, she could not deprive you of anything. Therefore,
if you are more than twenty-five years of age, and did not ratify the
transaction, and the lessor did not sell the slaves as being encumbered to
himself by the right of pledge, you can bring an action to recover them after
tendering the amount of the indebtedness.
5. The Same to JEgrus.
If after your emancipation your father sold a tract of land belonging to you
without your consent, and you did not become his heir, and were not protected
by possession based upon long time, the Governor of the province will cause the
land to be returned to you, if you institute proceedings for that purpose.
6. The Same to Rufus.
No one has been able to injure you by selling property which did not belong to
him, and upon which he had no lien, and which he had no authority to dispose
of.
7. The Emperor Justinian to John, Prietorian Prefect.
We decree that when the law forbids an alienation to be made, or this is done
by a testator, or in compliance with an agreement between contracting parties,
not only the alienation of ownership and the emancipation of slaves, but also
the transfer of the usufruct, or the hypothecation or encumbrance of the
property by way of pledge shall be absolutely prohibited. In like manner, We
decree that servitudes cannot be imposed upon the property, or emphyteutical
contracts executed except in cases where the authority of the constitutions,
the will of the testator, or the tenor of the agreement which forbade the
alienation permits something of this kind to be done.
TITLE LII. CONCERNING THE ALIENATION OF PROPERTY OWNED IN
COMMON.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Apollodorus.
If the purchaser of the land which you allege was sold by the coheirs of your
paternal uncle cannot avail himself of the privilege of usucaption, or of
prescription founded upon long-continued silence,
the right of action in remwill remain unimpaired, so far as your share is
concerned. If, however, the law has given the purchaser security, you have a
perfect right to sue those who consented to an unlawful sale of your portion of
the property.
2. The Same to Terentianus.
It makes a great deal of difference whether your co-heirs have sold property
held in common, or whether the Treasury, which owned a part of the same, sold
the whole of it on account of the peculiar privilege which it enjoyed; for if
the sale was made by the Treasury, the law does not permit the good faith of it
to be impugned. Where, however, the co-heirs sold the entire property, although
the purchaser, having been delegated by them, may have paid a part of the price
to the Treasury, and entered into an agreement to pay the balance, still, the
sale cannot prevent you from obtaining your share.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Eusebius.
You have been incorrectly informed that the undivided share of an estate which
is held in common can only be sold to one of the jomt-owners and not to a
stranger, before judgment has been rendered in a suit for partition.
4. The Same to the Soldier Ulpian.
Your brother had no right to alienate your share of the property, especially
while you were in the army, but it is not in conformity with military dignity
to demand that your share of it should be restored to you upon tendering the
price.
5. The Same and the Csesars to Olympianus.
If you, being more than twenty-five years of age at the time, sold an estate as
yours, not knowing that it was jointly owned by you and your brothers, although
no written instrument was drawn up as evidence of the sale, and no special
agreement was made, you will be obliged to pay to the purchaser the amount of
his interest, if the shares belonging to the others should be evicted.
TITLE LIII.
THOSE WHO HAVE CHARGE OF THE AFFAIRS OF OTHERS ARE NOT FORBIDDEN TO ALIENATE
THEIR OWN PROPERTY.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Publica.
Guardians or curators are not forbidden to alienate their own property, even
though they may have been legally declared indebted on account of their
administration. Therefore, your curator was able to encumber his property with
the lien upon it to Our Treasury, which he could also have done to a private
person.
TITLE LIV.
CONCERNING AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO BETWEEN VENDOR AND PURCHASER.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Diotima.
If you sold your estate under the condition that if the price should should not
be paid within a certain time, the purchaser would forfeit the earnest money,
and the ownership revert to you, the terms of the contract must be observed.
2. The Emperor Alexander to Charisius.
If your parents sold a tract of land under the condition that if they
themselves, or their heirs, should indefinitely, or within a designated time,
tender to the purchaser the price of the property he would restore it; and if
you are ready to comply with the above-mentioned condition, and the heir of the
purchaser refuses to fulfill the contract, the Actio prsescriptis verbis,or the
action on sale, shall be granted you; and an account shall be rendered you of
the amount of the crops taken from the land which have come into the hands of
your adversary, after the price was tendered in compliance with the terms of
the agreement.
3. The Same to the Soldier Felix.
If anyone should sell an estate on condition that if the balance of the
purchase-money was not paid within a certain time the property would revert to
him, as he did not deliver possession under a precarious title, he cannot bring
an action to recover the land, but he can bring one on account of the sale.
4. The Same to Julian.
He cannot avail himself of the condition under which a sale was made who, after
the day fixed for the payment of the purchase-money has arrived, does not
choose to bring an action to recover the property, but prefers to bring one to
collect the interest on the price.
5. The Emperor Gordian to Longinus.
When, at the time of the sale, you agreed that, if the person to whom you sold
the property should pay you interest on the price if it was not paid at the
time appointed, you will be correct in thinking that, after having made
application to the Governor of the province, you can compel its payment by the
purchaser; but if you did not make such an agreement in the beginning, having
begun suit, you will only legally be entitled to interest from the time when
the buyer was in default, and you can proceed not only against the debtor
himself, but also against anyone who has given security for the purchase.
6. The Emperors Cams, Carinus, and Numerian to Rimulus.
You having stated that in consideration of a certain matter agreed upon between
you, you transferred your land to another for a very
low price, you cannot be defrauded by this agreement; as, when the promise is
not fulfilled, it is proper that the ownership of the property should revert to
you. Therefore, having applied to a competent judge, he will take measures to
have the land which you mention returned to you with its crops without delay;
and especially if the other party has been repaid the money which you received
from him, he cannot be considered to have sustained any loss.
7. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Museus.
If the person to whom he alludes purchased anything from you, and it was agreed
that if a certain sum of money was not paid within a specified time the
transaction should be void; you cannot legally demand, under Our Rescript, that
this agreement be set aside. If, however, the purchaser withdraws, in order
that he may retain the ownership of the property by law, you can protect your
rights by the remedy of notice, sealing up of the money, and depositing it,
which has been established to prevent fraud.
8. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Auxanon.
It is certain that the agreement made between the purchaser and the vendor at
the time of the contract must be inviolably observed, provided it was not
annulled by a subsequent agreement.
9. The Emperor Justinian to John, Prsetoricm Prefect.
If someone in a contract of sale or alienation should agree that the new owner
should not, under any circumstances, be permitted to erect a monument in the
place which was sold, or transferred to him in any other way, or be deprived of
any right to which men are ordinarily entitled, We order that an agreement of
this kind shall be observed in accordance with Our law, and remain inviolate;
although a doubt arose on this point among the ancients, for it is a matter of
grave concern that the purchaser should become the neighbor of a person whom he
did not wish to be such, and still more, if the latter had been expressly
forbidden to reside near him. For when neither a vendor, nor anyone else who
alienates property, permits his right to be transferred, except under such a
condition, how can it be tolerated that he should suffer annoyance on account
of a different interpretation of the contract?
TITLE LV.
WHERE A SLAVE is SOLD FOR THE PURPOSE OF BEING SENT OUT OF THE COUNTRY.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Petronia.
Slaves who have been sold under the condition of their being sent out of the
country, or if this is not done, that they should be confiscated, can obtain
their freedom from the purchaser, or anyone who succeeds to his place, before
the terms of the contract are violated.
116
They can, however, be claimed by the Treasury after their manumission, and are
liable under the same condition to be reduced to perpetual servitude if they
should be found in those cities from which they are excluded by the contracting
parties. The power of confiscation is, however, not refused before their
manumission.
2. The Same to Nedienus.
When, however, you have provided that you shall have the right of seizure of a
slave, you can avail yourself of it; but if you omitted to do this, and
stipulated for a penalty, and the slave should be confiscated by the Treasury,
you will be entitled to the action based on the stipulation. In every instance,
however, inquiry should be made whether the slave came into the prohibited
place with the consent of his master.
3. The Emperor Alexander to Nonius.
In a case where a female slave was sold to be sent out of the country, and this
was not done, but while residing in the same city with the purchaser, the
latter manumitted her, she could not become free contrary to the condition of
the sale; and therefore if you apply to My attorney he will perform his duty.
4. The Same to Papias.
Iam annoyed because you allege that you have been sold by slaves whose master
you were, under the condition that you should not remain in the country, and
you state that you have been manumitted by him to whom your first master sold
you. For this reason a competent judge will examine the person who you say is
present, and if the truth of the accusation is established, he must punish the
detestable crime with the penalty of death. Your status, however, will be that
of a slave after manumission, if you establish the truth of the accusation
which you make.
5. The Same to Seraphianus.
A slave who has been sold by his master on condition of his removal from a city
cannot reside in the City of Rome. Where, however, the condition applies to a
certain province, he will be allowed to reside in Italy. Therefore, if you can
prove that the condition agreed upon was violated, you can avail yourself of
the right to which, for this reason, you are entitled.
TITLE LVI.
WHERE A SLAVE HAS BEEN SOLD ON CONDITION THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE PROSTITUTED.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Socrates.
Our friend, the Prefect of the City, will grant the power of arrest to anyone
who is entitled to it, in accordance with the Constitution
of the Divine Hadrian, where a slave has been sold under the condition that he
or she should not be prostituted, and this has been done. If the Prefect should
ascertain that the vendor, in violation of the condition which he himself
prescribed, permitted the woman to obtain dishonorable gain in this manner, as
she is entitled to freedom by the Constitution of the same Emperor, she should
be brought before the Prsetor having jurisdiction of cases involving liberty,
and he shall order proceedings to be instituted for that purpose at once; for
the force of the condition after it has once been made is not lost because the
ownership of the slave may have passed through several purchasers to the first
one who prostituted her, without prescribing a similar condition.
2. The Same to Severus, Przetorian Prefect.
It is necessary for the woman, whom you allege was sold under the condition
that she should not be prostituted, and in case this took place, she was to
become free, to be legally produced before the tribunal; and if any controversy
should arise with reference to the agreement (under which, if it is genuine and
the condition has been fulfilled, the woman will be entitled to her freedom),
the case shall proceed before the magistrate having jurisdiction of the same.
This condition, however, although it may not have been inserted in the bill of
sale, will be valid, if it is proved to have been made in a letter, or even if
it has not been reduced to writing.
3. The Same to Aurelius.
A female slave, who has been sold under the condition that she does not make a
shameful commerce of her body, must not prostitute herself in a tavern under
the pretext of serving therein, in order to avoid a fraudulent evasion of the
condition prescribed.
TITLE LVII.
WHERE A SLAVE HAS BEEN ALIENATED UNDER THE CONDITION THAT HE WILL OR WILL NOT
BE MANUMITTED.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Patricenstis.
If Patroclus, after he donated you to Hermia under the condition that if you
served her as a slave for sixteen continuous years, she would grant you your
freedom, and you would then become a Roman citizen, provided Patroclus did not
afterwards change his mind, or even if he died that you would be free; as it
has been established that this condition not only applies to slaves who are
sold, but also to such as are donated, you should be manumitted. The title to
you having once been transferred to Hermia, Patroclus could not afterwards sell
you to another; and therefore you should not contend that freedom which you
have already obtained by the constitution ought to be granted you, but you
should defend what you already have obtained.
2. The Same to the Freedman Eutychianus.
If Chrestes sold his slave, who is also his natural son, on condition that the
purchaser should manumit him, even though this may not have been done, he will
become free in accordance with the Constitution of the Divine Marcus and
Commodus, addressed to Aufidius.
3. The Same to Fulginius.
If Justa sold Saturninus a slave girl named Firma, who was at that time seven
years of age, under the condition that she should be free when she reached the
age of twenty-five years, although in the agreement relating to her freedom,
executed by the purchaser, this was not inserted, but it was merely stated,
"that she should become free;" still, in this instance, there is ground for the
application of the Constitution of the Divine Marcus and Commodus, included in
the collection of laws entitled Semesters. Therefore, when Firma reaches her
twenty-fifth year, she will become free, and it cannot be pleaded in opposition
to this that she was manumitted in her twenty-seventh year, because she was
already free under the terms of the constitution. Therefore, a child born of
you and her, who was conceived after the twenty-fifth year of its mother, is
freeborn.
4. The Emperor Gordian to Jocunda.
If anyone received a sum of money under the condition that he would grant you
your freedom within a specified time, and he delayed in complying with his
promise to liberate you, it is clear that you will be free from the .moment
when freedom should have been conferred upon you, and it was not done; and
therefore, it is certain that any children born to you ought to be considered
freeborn.
5. The Same to Martian.
Slaves, whose sale was made under the condition that they should not obtain
their freedom, cannot do so even if they are manumitted; for a condition which
attaches to a slave cannot be changed by the act of anyone who purchases him
subject to it; nor can a penalty legally be exacted for non-compliance with the
condition (if one was prescribed). Hence the person who imposed this condition
in making the sale cannot call you beforve the Attorney of the Treasury, as it
should not interfere with a private contract, and the letters which have been
sent to you do not prove that you violated the condition, if you yourself did
not manumit the slave.
6. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Rufinus.
If you sold a young girl under the condition that she should be manumitted, and
that, if this was not done, the purchaser must pay a hundred aurei,and the
contract is not complied with, it is established that the slave shall,
nevertheless, obtain the freedom which should have been granted her, nor can
the money be lawfully collected, as in the case of the violation of a contract,
since it has been decided, for
excellent reasons, that where the vendor did not subsequently change his mind,
compliance with the condition was not necessary for the purpose of manumission.
TITLE LVIII. CONCERNING ^DILIAN ACTIONS.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Decensius.
If someone, not in good faith, but with the intention of committing fraud,
should sell you a slave who is in the habit of running away, or one with some
other defect, without your being aware of it, and the said slave takes to
flight, a competent judge (as has already been established) shall order that
the vendor shall not only be liable for the price of the slave, but shall also
make good any damage which you may have sustained on his account.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Penthilius.
As you state that a slave whom you purchased some time since ran away a year
ago, I cannot permit you on this account to hold the vendor responsible; as it
is a plain rule of law that the Actio redhibitoriacannot be brought after six
months, or the one Quanta minorisafter a year.1
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Mutian.
The purchaser must bear the loss of the slave if he becomes a fugitive after
the sale, and it is not proved that he ran away from his former master. If,
however, the vendor should rashly guarantee that a slave had no vice, and that
he would not have any hereafter, although this appears to be impossible, still
there is no doubt that an action can be brought in accordance with the terms of
the contract, made either before or at the time of the sale; for subsequent
accidents are at the risk of the purchaser, not of the vendor. But as you state
that the slave whom you purchased returned to the person who sold him, a
competent judge, after having taken all the circumstances into consideration,
will render a decision in accordance with the nature of the facts.
4. The Same to Falsus.
When anyone purchases a tract of land under the condition that if he should be
displeased with it, it should be considered as not sold,
1 The Actio quanti minorisdiffered from the Actio redhibitoriain that the
latter was intended to effect an absolute rescission of the contract, involving
a return of the property sold with the profit of the same, as well as the
collection . of damages resulting from any defects known by the vendor to have
been in existence, which, when the sale was negotiated, would have been
sufficiently serious to have interfered with it; while, under the Actio quanti
minorisonly the amount of the decrease in value caused by such defects could be
recovered, by compelling that much of the purchase-money to be refunded. There
was nothing to prevent this suit from being repeatedly brought with reference
to the same transaction, where the defects were not all discernible at the same
time.ED.
it is clear that it having been returned as sold under a condition, the Actio
redhibitoriawill lie against the vendor.
The same rule shall be observed where the land is pestilential, that is to say,
where it contains dangerous or poisonous herbs, and the purchaser was ignorant
of this when it was sold, for it is established that in this case, also, the
above-mentioned action can be brought.
5. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Nephri-dms.
Although a bona fidecontract may have been made for a slave, and the latter may
have been delivered, and the price paid, still, the right of recovery is
granted to the person who purchased him if he can produce the slave, whom he
alleges has taken to flight.
This rule should not only be observed with reference to barbarian slaves, but
also concerning such as are natives of the provinces.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Kalendsof July, during the
Consulate of Honorius, Consul for the ninth time, and Evodius, Consul for the
fifth time.
TITLE LIX.
CONCERNING MONOPOLIES, UNLAWFUL AGREEMENTS OF MERCHANTS, THE ARTIFICERS OR
CONTRACTORS, AND THE ILLEGAL AND PROHIBITED PRACTICES OF BATH PROPRIETORS.
1. The Emperdr Zeno to Constantine, Prsetorian Prefect.
We order that no one shall be so bold as to monopolize the sale of clothing of
any kind, or of fish, combs, copper utensils, or anything else having reference
to the nourishment or the common use of mankind, no matter of what material it
may be composed, whether he does so by his own authority, or under that of a
Rescript already promulgated, or which may hereafter be promulgated, or of a
pragmatic sanction, or of any Imperial Annotation; and let no one conspire, or
agree in any unlawful assembly, that any kind of merchandise which is an object
of commerce shall not be sold for less than is agreed upon by the parties in
question.
Builders of houses or contractors, and artificers of other different trades, as
well as proprietors of baths, are absolutely forbidden from entering into
agreements with one another, providing that where one of them is engaged to
perform some work it cannot be done by another, or that one shall interfere to
prevent another who has been employed to do it. Permission is hereby given to
anyone to complete work which is unfinished and abandoned by another, without
fearing to be subjected to expense by the latter, and to denounce all crimes of
this kind without fear, and without being subjected to expense in court.
Moreover, if anyone should venture to practice monopoly, he shall be deprived
of all his property, and sentenced to perpetual exile. Again, We decree that
those who are at the head of other professions, and
hereafter venture to fix the prices of their merchandise, or bind themselves by
any illegal contracts of this kind, shall be punished by a fine of forty pounds
of gold, and that your tribunal shall be condemned to pay a fine of fifty
pounds of gold if it should happen that, either through venality,
dissimulation, or some other vice, the provisions of Our most salutary
Constitution with reference to prohibited monopolies and forbidden agreements
of corporate bodies should not be executed.1
1 Moslem law considers the hoarding of provisions for the purpose of raising
the price a most heinous offence. Mohammed said, "Whosoever keepeth back grain
forty days, in order to increase its price, is at variance with God, and God is
at variance with him." "It is abominable to monopolize the necessaries of life,
and food for cattle, in a city where such monopoly is likely to prove
detrimental." (The Hedaya IV, XLIV, VI.)
In England, all measures tending to produce a scarcity of merchandise or labor
by means of a monopoly was held to be in violation of the fundamental laws of
the Kingdom. By the Stat. 21, Jac. I, Cap. 3, it was provided that:
"I. All Monopolies, and all Commissions of or for the sole buying, selling,
making, working or using of any thing within the King's Dominions, or any other
Monopolies, or of Power, Liberty, or Faculty to dispense with any others, or to
give Licence or Tolleration to do, use or exercise any thing against the Tenor
of any Law or Statute, or to give or make any Warrant for such Dispensation,
Licence, or Tolleration, or to agree or compound for any Penalty or Forfeiture
limited by any Statute, or for any Grant or Promise of any Benefit or Profit of
any such Penalty, Forfeiture or Sum of Money, before Judgment thereupon had;
and all Proclamations, Inhibitions, Restraints, Warrants of Assistances, and
other matters and things whatsoever any way tending to the erecting,
strengthening or countenancing thereof, are contrary to the Laws of the Realm,
and shall be void and of none effect.
"II. All the matters and things aforesaid shall be examined, heard, tried and
 determined by the Common Laws of the Realm, and not otherwise; And all
Persons are prohibited to use, exercise or put them in use."
The penalty was treble damages and double costs. Coke, in his commentaries on
this Statute, discusses the evil in concise and forcible terms. (Institutes
III, 85, Page 181.)
Agreements for interference with the distribution of commodities of various
kinds, the control of them for speculative purposes, hoarding the necessaries
of life, or diminishing their production, is punished by the laws of the United
States with a fine not exceeding ten thousand dollars, or imprisonment for not
more than two years, or both. (Barnes1 Federal Code, Sec. 10188.)
The Spanish Penal Code prescribes a penalty of from one month and one day to
six months for conspiracy to raise, lower, or regulate the conditions of labor;
and, when false rumors are spread to affect the price of articles of commerce,
in addition to imprisonment, a fine of from five hundred to five thousand
pesetasis imposed. "Los que se coligaren con el fin de encarecer 6 abaratar
abusivamente el precio del trabajo 6 regular sus condiciones, serdn castigados,
siempre que la coligacion hubiere comenzado a ejecutarse, con la, pena de
arresto mayor."
"Esta pena se impondra en su grado 'maxima a los Jefes y promovedores de la
coligacion y a los que para asegurar su exito emplearen violencias 6 amenazas,
a no ser que por ellas merecieren mayor pena." (Codigo Penal de Espana,Arts.
556, 557.)
Monopoly of the necessaries of life is punished in Portugal with a fine, and
imprisonment of from one to six months; conspiracy to> suspend, hinder, or
raise the price of labor accompanied by threats, with imprisonment of from one
to two years. "Os que tiverem promovido a colligagao ou a dirigirem, e bem
assim os que usarem de violencia ou ameaga para assegurar a execucao, serdo
punidos com a prisao de um a dois annos." (Codigo Penal PortuguezII, XI, I.)
TITLE LX. CONCERNING FAIRS AND MARKETS.
1. The Emperors Valens and Valentinian to Probus, Prsetorian Prefect.
Persons who either by Our authority, or through the indulgence of Our
predecessors enjoy the privilege of holding markets or fairs, obtain the
benefit of rescripts to the extent that suit cannot be brought against them
either on account of their business or their slaves, while the fairs or markets
are being held; nor can they be compelled by any individual to pay a certain
price for the places which they temporarily occupy; nor can they, under the
pretext of a private debt, be subjected to any annoyance while they are there.
TITLE LXI.
CONCERNING DUTIES ON MERCHANDISE, AND OFFENCES TO WHICH THEY ARE SUBJECT.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Victorinus.
If you were legally manumitted before any question of the violation of the
customs laws was raised, it is not just that you should be deprived of your
status on this account.
2. The Same to Linuus.
An offence of this kind cannot be punished if it is alleged to have been
committed five years ago, provided suit has not been brought for the property
within that time; nor can the price of it be demanded under such circumstances,
if it does not exist, and has not been fraudulently suppressed.
3. The Same to the Soldier Ingenuus.
We have consulted the welfare of all Our soldiers in not rendering them liable
to the penalty for defrauding the customs by not making
The penalty prescribed by Italian law for the fraudulent diminution of
provisions or their increase in price through fraudulent representations is
imprisonment for from one to five years, and a fine of from five hundred to
five thousand lire($100 to $1000).
"Chiunque, con false notizie o altri mezzi fraudolenti, produce la deficienza,
o il rincaro di sostanze alimentari, e punito con la reclusione da uno a cinque
anni e con la multa da lire cinquecento a cinquemila." (Codice Penale del Regna
d'ltalia,Art. 326.)
An attempt to either raise or lower wages by means of force, fraud, or threats
in Prance subjects the culprit to a fine of from sixteen to three thousand
francs, and imprisonment of from six days to three years. "Sera puni d'un
emprisonne-ment de six jours a trois ans et d'une amende de16 francs a3000
francs, ou de I'une de ces deux peines seulement, quiconque, a I'aide de
violences, voies de fait, menaces ou manoeuvres frauduleuses, aura a/mene ou
maintenu, tente d'amener ou de maintenir une cessation concertee de travail,
dans le but de forcer la hausse ou la baisse des salaires ou de porter atteinte
au libre exercice de I'industrie ou du travail." (Code Penal de France,Art.
414.)ED.
declarations. Therefore, dismissing any fear of this kind, if it is apparent
that you owe any duties, pay them.
4. The Emperor Constantine to Rufus.
In farming out the collection of taxes, he shall have the preference who offers
the highest bid, and the lease shall be made for not less than a term of three
years; nor shall the time prescribed for collection be subject to interruption
in any way. The said term having expired, it will be necessary again to farm
out the right to the highest bidder, in like manner, at auction.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of the Csesar-
Crispus, Consul for the second time, and Constantine, 321.
5. The Same to Menander.
No tax shall be collected by officials appointed for that purpose from
residents in the provinces, on property employed for their own use, or on that
of the Treasury, or on such as is used for cultivating the soil. We, however,
subject all other property, exclusive of that above mentioned, or which is
employed in trade, to the ordinary dues and charges; and the penalty of death
is pronounced against the receivers of taxes, municipal employees, and other
persons whose avarice tempts them to disobey this law.
6. The Emperors Valens and Valentinian to Florentinus, Count of the Sacred
Largesses.
The same rule should be observed with reference to the property of persons in
private life, so far as public duties are concerned. We mention this because
some individuals produce rescripts by which they assert that they are released
from the payment of taxes or duties on merchandise which it is customary to pay
to the Treasury. Hence, if any private person should attempt to avail himself
of a rescript of this kind, it shall be considered void, for the payment of
duties is not unimportant, and should be made equally by all those who have
charge of the sale or the transport of merchandise, with the exception of
shipmasters, when they are proved to be transporting their own property.
7. The Same and Gratian to Arckelaus, Count of the East.
No one shall, under any circumstances, be permitted to pay less than one-eighth
in the settlement of duties on merchandise, which is the usual amount fixed for
all those who desire to engage in commerce, and no exception should be made in
the case of soldiers.
8. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Palla-dius, Count of
the Sacred Largesses.
Collectors of customs shall receive from the ambassadors of nations tributary
to Our Empire, duties on merchandise, which they bring from their own country
into this; but such merchandise as they are permitted by law to remove from
Roman soil to their own country, they have a right to take away immune from
payment, and free.
9. The Same to the Same Count of the Sacred Largesses.
We forbid any privilege to be exercised with reference to duties in Egypt and
Augustanica, and We do not permit anyone to rashly claim the right to the
transport of animals, which is only authorized when the ordinary duties are
paid.
10. The Emperors Arcadius and Honoring to Rufinus, Praetorian Prefect.
We order that, whatever duties on merchandise municipalities may have
established for their own advantage and that of their curisein order to defray
expenses, whether this has been done for the benefit of the curise,or has been
designed for some other use of the said municipalities, shall be confirmed, and
remain in force for all time; and that no annoyance need be apprehended from
persons petitioning against the collection of said duties.
11. The Same to Lampadius, Prtetorian Prefect.
If anyone, without the authority of the public lessees of saltpits, should
purchase salt, or attempt to sell it, whether he acts upon his own
responsibility, or is provided with one of Our Rescripts; this salt, together
with the price paid for the same, shall be adjudged to the said lessees.
12. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Cuso, Count of the Sacred
Largesses.
We decree that where anything granted by pragmatic sanctions or Imperial
Annotations, against the collection of taxes, has been bestowed as a favor, it
shall be of no force or effect.
13. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Flavian, Prse-torian Prefect.
With the exception of those duties on merchandise which have always formed a
part of Our Imperial patrimony, all duties shall be reserved for the cities of
the Empire, after the expenses required for public necessities have been
deducted. As the former rule was that two-thirds of these imposts should be
paid into Our Treasury, We now order that the remaining third shall be at the
disposal of the different cities and municipalities, that they may learn that
these duties have been established more for their advantage than for that of
others; therefore, the enjoyment of the portion designated shall be permitted
to these cities so that they will have full power to farm them out to the
extent of their interest in the same.
TITLE LXII. NEW DUTIES ON MERCHANDISE CANNOT BE ESTABLISHED.
1. The Emperor Severus and Antoninus to Vietorinus.
The collection of new duties should not be rashly permitted, but if your city
is so poor that extraordinary means must be taken to
relieve it, state to the Governor of the province what you have set forth in
your petition. He, after having diligently examined the matter with a view to
the common welfare, shall write to Us what he has ascertained, and We will
decide your case as We think best.
2. The Same to Callistianus.
New duties on merchandise cannot be established by the ordinance of a
municipality.
3. The Emperors Gallienus and Valerian to Tuscits and Others.
New duties are not usually established by Emperors without reflection, and
therefore a competent judge will forbid anything to be collected which is
illegally demanded, and if what has been collected has been extorted contrary
to law, he must order it to be returned.
4. The Emperor Constantine to Felix, Prsetorian Prefect.
If complaint of the greed of farmers of the Revenue should be made by the
subjects of Our provinces, and it is proved that they have violated the ancient
custom, as well as Our regulations, those who are guilty of so serious a crime
shall be punished with perpetual exile.
The supervision of this employment is hereby conferred upon you and your
successors.
TITLE LXIII. CONCERNING COMMERCE AND MERCHANTS.
1. The Emperors Valens and Valentinian to Julian, Count of the East.
Merchants who are attached to Our palace, as well as those forming part of the
households of nobles, are admonished to acknowledge any claims which they owe
(as honesty demands), in order that their example may be followed by all those
who obtain profit from trade.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof May, during the
Consulate of the Divine Jovian, and Varronian, 364.
2. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Tatian, Count of the
Sacred Largesses.
Not only shall no gold be furnished to barbarians, but even if any should be
found in their possession they must be deprived of it by artifice. If, however,
gold should hereafter be given to barbarians by traders, in payment for slaves
or other merchandise, they shall not be fined, but shall suffer death; and when
a judge does not punish such a crime after he has discovered it, or conceals
it, he shall be punished as an accomplice.
3. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Theodore, Prsetorian Prefect.
We forbid persons of noble birth, or those who are conspicuous through the
honors they enjoy, or are wealthy, to carry on any trade
which is injurious to cities, in order that the power to purchase and sell may
be rendered more easy between plebeians and merchants.
4. The Same to Anthemim, Prsetorian Prefect.
Not only merchants who owe allegiance to Our government, but also those who are
subject to the King of the Persians, must not hold markets beyond the places
agreed upon at the time of the treaty concluded with the above-mentioned
nation, in order to prevent the secrets of either kingdom from being disclosed
(which is improper). Therefore, no subject of Our Empire shall hereafter
presume to travel for the purpose of selling merchandise beyond Nisibis,
Callini-cum, and Artaxata, nor think that he can exchange merchandise anywhere
beyond the above-mentioned cities. All persons are hereby notified that if one
makes a contract under such circumstances, any merchandise which has been
either sold or purchased beyond said cities shall be confiscated by Our
Treasury, and, in addition to this, the price which was paid, or any articles
given in exchange shall be surrendered, and the offender sentenced to the
penalty of perpetual exile.
Judges, and their subordinates also, shall be condemned to pay thirty pounds of
gold for every contract entered into beyond the abovementioned limits, whenever
any Romans or Persians have passed the said frontier to the forbidden ground,
for the purpose of trade; with the exception of those envoys of the Persians
who have at some time been despatched to Us and have brought merchandise to be
exchanged, to whom, for the sake of humanity and on account of their character
as ambassadors, We do not refuse the privilege of trading beyond the prescribed
limits; unless, under the pretext of belonging to an embassy, and having
remained for a long time in some province, they do not return to their own
country; for, as they engage in trade, the penalty of this law will not
unreasonably be imposed upon them, as well as upon those with whom they have
contracted or resided.
5. The Same to ZEtius, Praetorian Prefect.
With a view to disposing of any attempt or claim to increase it, the membership
of the association of merchants is hereby fixed at five hundred and sixty-
three, and none shall be added to it, nor the number be altered; nor shall
anyone have authority to substitute another in the place of a member who dies,
but those who have died shall be replaced by others selected by your tribunal
from the same class to which the deceased belonged, in the presence of the
corporate body; and no privilege shall be granted to anyone of the members to
exceed the above-mentioned number.
6. The Same to Maximus, Count of the Sacred Lar'gesses.
If those who have been convicted of having gone beyond the cities named in the
ancient laws, or of having entertained foreign merchants for the purpose of
trade, without the consent of the Count of Commerce; they cannot escape the
confiscation of their property
and the penalty of perpetual exile. Therefore, all persons, whether they are in
private life, hold some civil office, or belong to the army, are informed that
they must absolutely abstain from any rash behavior of this kind, or be
subjected to the punishments above mentioned.
TITLE LXIV.
CONCERNING THE EXCHANGE OF PROPERTY AND THE ACTIO PK^SCRIPTIS VERBIS.
1. The Emperor Gordian to Therasa.
If your paternal uncle had land for sale, and your father gave him another
tract by way of price, although the value was not appraised, and you state that
what you purchased was evicted, not on account of the injustice of the judge,
but through your father's negligence, it is not unreasonable for you to ask to
recover the amount of your interest by the action on purchase, if you have
succeeded to the rights of your father. Where, however, the land was not for
sale, but an exchange was made, and what you received from the other party was
evicted, you can reasonably demand the tract given in exchange, for it should
be returned if you desire this to be done.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Primitiva.It is a well-known rule of
law that an exchange made of property in good faith such as you mention is
equivalent to a sale.
3. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Leontius.
It is established that no one will obtain a right of action by virtue of a
contract for exchange, where nothing was done, unless the stipulation based
upon the obligation created by the words acquires one for the parties.
4. The Sam.e Emperors and Csesars to the Same Leontius.
As you state in your petition that a contract for exchange was made between you
and another person, and the land which, was given by you has been sold, you are
advised that you will not be entitled to any action against the purchaser, as
he has received the title to the property from him to whom you do not deny that
you transferred it by way of exchange.
If, however, a stipulation has been added to the contract, you will not be
prevented from suing the creditors of the person with whom you made it. But
where no stipulation was added, you will be entitled to bring the Actio
prasscriptis verbis,so that either the terms of the contract may be observed in
your behalf, or that what you gave in exchange for the land of the other party
may be restored to you, as the contract was not executed.
5. The Same Emperors and Caesars to Theodolana.
As you allege that your father conveyed a certain tract of land to the person
against whom you filed your petition, on condition that he
would receive a certain house in exchange, he having appeared before the
Governor of the province, the latter will order the other party to comply with
his agreement, for if he should find that the consideration for the conveyance
of the land was not transferred, he shall order that whatever was given
conditionally shall be restored to you.
6. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Protogencs.
The authority of the law shows that where property has been delivered under a
certain condition, the uncertain civil action prse-scriptis verbisshould be
granted, if the condition is not complied with.
7. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Timotheus.
It has long since been decided that a sale cannot take place by giving property
instead of money. Therefore, as you assert that you have delivered a certain
amount of grain to Callimacus and Acamatus, under the condition that they would
furnish you a specified quantity of oil, if no stipulation was made, and they
do not fulfill the contract, you can bring a personal action to recover the
amount of grain which you gave, on the ground that the contract was not carried
out, if you desire to do so.
8. The Same Emperors and Cassars to Paulina.
Property having been given to Candidus in consideration that he would furnish
you every month or every year with what was agreed upon, as an agreement of
this kind cannot be considered to be one without consideration, because the
condition has been fortified by the delivery of the property, you will be
entitled to the Actio prtescriptis verbisto compel the fulfillment of the
contract in accordance with your demand.
TITLE LXV. CONCERNING LEASING AND HIRING.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Agrippina.
The owner of a warehouse is not liable to the lessee for the exertion of
superior force, or the breaking in of robbers. Where, however, neither of these
things take place, if any property which has been deposited in the warehouses
should be destroyed, the owner must indemnify the lessee for the loss of the
same.
2. The Same to Epictetus.
If you bring an action on lease against persons by whom you have been employed
in the construction of a building, you will recover by this action, which is
one of good faith, whatever is due to you, with interest.
3. The Same to Callimorphonia.
If you have paid to the owner the entire amount of the rent of a house, which
you say that you have leased, you cannot be ejected
against your consent, unless the owner can prove that the building is required
for his own use, or he desires to repair it, or you have not acted as you
should have done with reference to the property leased.
4. The Emperor Alexander to Sabinus.
Certain rules are founded on the Rescripts of the Emperor Antoninus Pius,
namely, that the owners of warehouses which have been broken into shall be
compelled to produce before the persons making complaint the guards who were
placed over the said warehouses, and if they do so, they shall not incur any
further responsibility; and you, having applied to the Governor of the
province, can cause this to be done.
Where, however, circumstances demand the infliction of a more severe penalty,
the magistrate must send the culprit to Domitius Ulpian, Prastorian Prefect,
and My relative. If the owners of the warehouses specifically promised that
they themselves would guard them, they themselves should be produced.
5. The Same to Petroma.
It is a certain rule of law that property which tenants, with the consent of
their masters, have brought upon leased land, will be liable by the right of
pledge to the owners of the said land. When, however, a house is leased, it is
not necessary for the owner to know that articles have been brought into it, in
order to subject them to the right of pledge.
6. The Same to Victorinus.
No one is prevented from leasing to another property which he himself has
rented for his own enjoyment, if nothing to the contrary has been agreed upon.
7. The Same to Terentianus.
If Henries leased the collection of taxes for the continuous term of five
years, and you became his surety; and, after the said term has elapsed, he
renews the lease, and is considered solvent, and you have not consented, but
have requested the return of your bond, a competent judge will understand that
you must not be rendered liable for any time subsequent to the term of five
years.
8. The Same to Higinius.
If you have leased a tract of land for a certain quantity of something to be
furnished every year, although this may not have been stated in the lease (as
the custom of the country demanded), so that if, on account of the effect of
bad weather or some other accident, loss should result, you will be
responsible; and if it is proved that any barren years were not compensated by
the abundance of others, you will, in accordance with good faith, be justified
in asking to be released from your promise, and the judge who decides the
appeal must observe this rule.
9. The Same to Fuscus.
It is not necessary for the purchaser of land to permit the tenant to whom the
former owner leased it to remain until his lease has expired, unless he bought
the property under this condition. If, however, it is proved by any agreement
that he did consent that the tenant should remain until the expiration of his
lease, even though this may not have been reduced to writing, he will be
compelled by an action of good faith to comply with the contract which he made.
10. The Emperor Gordian to Pomponius.
You are departing from the truth, if you assume that the heirs of a lessee do
not succeed him in a lease; for, whether the lease is perpetual or temporary,
it descends to the heirs, and where it is temporary, the heir is bound by the
provisions of the contract for the unexpired part of the term.
11. The Emperor Philip to Theodora.
It has frequently been stated in Rescripts that lessees or their heirs, after
the expiration of their terms, cannot be compelled to remain against their
consent.
12. The Same to Nica.
With reference to the damage committed by robbers against the property which
you have leased, you have no reason to demand indemnification by the owner of
said property, whom you do not accuse of being guilty of any offence.
13. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus, and the Csesar Valerian, to Heraclida.
If a lease has been divided so that each party has a share, some of you cannot
be sued by the others. If, however, all the lessees have bound themselves to
the lessor, he should not be deprived of the right of proceeding against any
one of the lessees whom he may select. You, however, will have the power to
tender what is due to the lessor, so that you yourselves can demand that the
obligations, for which you have been sued by the others under the terms of the
said lease, shall be transferred to you.
14. The Same Emperors and Csesars, to Julian and Others.
If those who were employed by you to purchase wheat and barley for public
subsistence, after having received the money, failed to carry out their
contracts, you can bring the action on hiring against them.
15. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Euphrosina.
If you have been ejected from the land by the lessee, as you can bring suit
against him under the lease, you can also exact and retain from the lessor the
penalty which it was agreed upon should be paid if the terms of the lease were
violated.
16. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Timotheus.
The provisions of a lease must be observed, and no more than was agreed upon
can be demanded as rent. If, however, the term for which the land was leased
has expired, and the lessee remains in possession, it is considered that the
lease and the obligation of pledge are both renewed by tacit consent.
17. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Hosalius.
The Governor of the province shall see that what is due as rent is paid without
delay, and he is aware that as an action on leasing and hiring is one of good
faith, it admits of the collection of legal interest when there is any delay.
18. The Same to Amnus.
The Governor of the province shall order any crops collected during the time
following that when the locusts by their ravages caused sterility to be
returned to you, if it is established that you are entitled to them in
accordance with the custom of former times.
19. The Same to Valerius.
The terms of a contract with reference to leasing and hiring shall, by all
means, be observed, where nothing contrary to the custom of the country has
been expressly provided. If, however, certain persons, in opposition to the
provisions of the contract and the custom of the country, have remitted the
payment of rent, this cannot prejudice the rights of the others.
20. The Same to Carpophorus.
Anyone who leases his own property, thinking that it belongs to another, does
not transfer the ownership of the same, but makes a lease which is void.
21. The Same Emperors and C&sars to Antonia.
If, for a certain quantity of oil, you have leased the crops of your land for a
year, you cannot withdraw from the contract, if it was made in good faith, for
the reason that someone else offered you a larger quantity of oil.
22. The Same Emperors and Ctesars to Papinianus.
If those against whom you have filed your petition leased their services to you
for a certain time, a competent judge, after proper cause is shown, shall order
the agreement to be observed, so far as good faith demands.
23. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Priscus.
In order to establish the proof of ownership of property, or to defend the
title to the same, it will not be sufficient to plead that a lease was made to
him who subsequently claimed it, as the ignorance or
mistake of the owner does not confer consent; but if the latter should be
defeated in the end, the contract of the lease is held never to have existed,
for no one can legally transfer his own property to himself.
24. The Same Emperors and Cazsars to Antoninus.
A contract of leasing and hiring is considered valid, even if no instrument
evidencing it has been drawn up; in accordance with which you cannot sue the
wife of the lessor, even though the lease may not have been reduced to writing.
However, with reference to the subsequent time during which you allege that the
woman has been your lessee, after having proved the statements in your
petition, notify her to pay you the rent in full.
25. The Same and the Caesars to Epagathus.
When anyone has received a field, or any other property whatsoever under a
lease, he should first restore possession of it, and then litigate as to the
ownership of the same.
26. The Same Emperors and Cassars to Oplo and Hermogenes.
If you have complied with the provisions of the lease, any instrument drawn up
with reference to the same loses its effect. Where, however, anything of yours
remains upon the land, or has been forcibly removed therefrom, the Governor of
the province shall order it to be returned to you.
27. The Same Emperors and Cassars to Nero.
If the owner of land has promised to pay you, as stipulator, any expenses you
may have incurred under the lease in behalf of the tenants, a competent judge
will order you to be reimbursed. When, however, the agreement was made without
a stipulation, you are informed that a right of action does not arise from a
contract without consideration.
28. The Same Emperors and Ctesars to the Same Nero.
In contracts of leasing and hiring it is established that the lessor can bring
suit on the ground of fraud or want of care, but not for unavoidable accident.
29. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Julian.
As you allege that the lessor destroyed buildings which he received in good
condition, the Governor of the province shall order the said buildings to be
restored by his heirs in accordance with the contract made between you.
30. The Emperors Theodosius and Valerian to Florentius, Prs&-torian Prefect.
A decurion cannot be the attorney, the lessee, the surety, or the mandator of a
lessor, and, moreover, We decree that no obligation arising from a contract of
this kind shall bind either the lessee or lessor.
31. The Emperor Leo to Aspar, Officer of the Army.
We forbid our soldiers to become either the lessees of the property of others,
or the attorneys, sureties, or mandators of lessees, lest, by neglecting the
practice of arms, they may devote themselves to rural labors, and, on account
of their being in military service, may become a menace to their neighbors.
Therefore, let them devote themselves with arms, and not to private matters, so
that, always being with their companies and their standards, they may be able
to protect the government, by which they are supported, from all the calamities
of war.
32. The Emperor Zeno to Adamantius, Prsetorian Prefect.
No one who has rented a house, a shop, or a farm shall, after his lease has
expired, be permitted to bring suit against a person who has leased the same
property on the same terms, with the consent of its owner, on the ground that
the lease is unlawful, or attempt to injure him thereby, but every facility
shall be afforded the owners of property to lease their houses, their lands, or
their shops to anyone they wish, and those who have leased them shall, by all
means, be protected from any annoyance of this kind; unless contracts
especially entered into in writing with the owners, or with those who
afterwards leased the property, and which were drawn up according to law,
should justify them in instituting proceedings.
Where, however, anyone in private life thinks that he has a right to raise a
controversy of this kind forbidden by Our Sacred Constitutions, after having
been severely whipped, he shall suffer the penalty of exile, and if a public
official does so, he shall be fined ten pounds of gold.
33. The Same to Sebastian, Praetorian Prefect.
If lessees of the property of others, or those who have precarious possession
of the same, or their heirs, do not surrender it when the owners desire to
recover it, but wait until final judgment has been rendered against them, they
shall not only be compelled to return the land which was leased, but also to
pay the successful party a sum equal to its value, as in the case of one who
seizes the property of another.
34. The Emperor Justinian to the Senate.
Although it is well known that former Emperors have promulgated many decrees
with regard to soldiers who lease the lands or houses of others; still, because
the subject has been so neglected, and soldiers, not being mindful of the
limits prescribed by Our Sacred Constitutions, venture to employ themselves in
base occupations of this kind, and having abandoned the public welfare and
their victorious standards, are only too eager to rent the property of others,
and not to manifest the power of their arms against the enemy, but to turn them
against their neighbors, and even against the unfortunate tenants whom they
have undertaken to protect, We have considered it necessary to publish this
most Sacred Constitution for the purpose of thoroughly and completely
correcting this abuse.
Hence We order that all who are serving in the army, whether they are of age or
minors (and We designate as soldiers not only those who, enrolled in the
military service, and serving under distinguished commanders, but also such as
are included in the eleven faithful divisions called scholse,as well as those
who have received the name of "confederates," and are commanded by different
subordinate officers), shall hereafter absolutely abstain from leasing the
property of others; and they are hereby notified that, under a contract of this
kind, from the very beginning, they will forfeit their rank and privileges
without the performance of any other act, and without any sentence being passed
upon them; and that they cannot be restored to their former positions either
through the indulgence of the Emperor, or by the consent or permission of any
military magistrate, to whose command they are subject; in order that they may
not think that by leasing the property of others they will not lose their
reputation, and from soldiers become civilians, and from being honored become
infamous; and that they shall be compelled to restore, without delay or
procrastination, whatever they may have received from the public, if they have
made a contract of this kind which We have absolutely forbidden. Those who,
after the promulgation of this law, permit their property to be leased to
persons of this kind, are also notified that, having by their efforts, violated
Our law, they shall not be permitted to collect anything; so that, as in the
case of a person who attempts to seize the property of another, anyone who
selects a soldier as his agent shall be deprived of any profit which may be due
to him.
Moreover, all persons shall have a right to bring an accusation under this law
before a competent judge, and he who, under such circumstances, appears as an
informer shall be understood to be more worthy of praise than blame. The
penalty which We have decreed shall be enforced in future cases against
soldiers who have violated Our law and those persons who have allowed them to
rent their property.
TITLE LXVI. CONCERNING THE LAW OF EMPHYTEUSIS.
1. The Emperor Zeno to Sebastian, Praetorian Prefect.
The right of emphyteusis should not be classed with those conferred by lease or
alienation, but We have decreed that it shall constitute a third species of
contract, separate from and without resemblance to either of those previously
mentioned, and shall have its own nature and definition, and be a just and
valid agreement by which everything that was consented to between the
contracting parties in all cases, even in those which are accidental, shall, if
reduced to writing, remain under all circumstances, firm and inviolable; so
that if no provision has been made for the occurrence of accidents, and if,
through some unforeseen event which may arise, the property which was the
subject of the emphyteusis should be destroyed, the loss will be borne, not by
the emphyteuta, who had nothing left, but by the owner of the
property who, for the reason that it was the result of a fatality, must be
responsible for it, as the contract contained nothing with reference to the
liability of the other party. When, however, the damage is trifling, and only
affected a portion of the property, or the substance of the latter was
uninjured, the emphyteuta should not hesitate to assume the loss himself.
2. The Emperor Justinian to Demosthenes, Prsetoricm Prefect.
With reference to emphyteutical contracts, We decree that if any agreements
should be inserted in them, they shall be observed with all the other
provisions, and even in the case of the ejection for non-compliance of the
person who undertook to carry them out, this shall still apply if he does not
produce receipts to show that the rent or public taxes on the land have been
paid. Where, however, nothing was agreed on this point, and he did not pay to
the owner either the rent or the taxes for the entire term of three years, or
produce receipts for the same, and the latter should desire to do so, he can
eject him from the land, and the former cannot oppose him on the ground of
improvements made by him or of such ameliorations as are designated
emponemata,or by demanding a penalty; but, if the owner prefers, he can be
unconditionally ejected, even though the former may allege that he has never
been annoyed by what is assigned as the reason for his expulsion; for no one
should wait for an agreement or notice, but should appear in person of his own
accord, and spontaneously discharge his indebtedness, in accordance with what
has been provided in general terms by one of Our former laws.
However, in order that the owner of the land may not under this pretext make
use of his power to expel his tenants, and refuse to receive the rent, and
thus, by means of an artifice of this kind, the term of three years having
expired, he who received the emphyteusis be deprived of his right, We grant him
permission to tender the rent in the presence of witnesses, and having sealed
it up, and deposited it, as prescribed by law, to entertain no fear of
ejection.
3. The Same to Julian, Prsetorian Prefect.
As a doubt arose whether the emphyteuta should obtain the consent of the owner
of the land to alienate his improvements which are called by the Greek word
empomenata,and whether he was required also to obtain his consent to transfer
his emphyteutical right to another, We decree that when an emphyteutical
instrument contains any provisions on this point they shall be observed. If,
however, no contract of this kind was made, or the instrument containing the
emphyteutical contract has been lost, the emphyteuta can under no circumstances
be permitted to sell his improvements, or transfer his rights under the
emphyteusis to others, without the consent of the owner of the land. But lest
owners, taking advantage of this opportunity, may not permit their emphyteutas
to receive the cost of the improvements which they made, but deceive them, and
in this manner the advantage to which the emphyteuta is entitled will be lost,
We
decree that notice shall be given to the owner in which the statement is made
of the price which he could obtain from another, and if the owner should prefer
to pay it himself, and give as much as the emphy-teuta could actually obtain
from a third party, the owner himself should by all means be preferred in
making the sale.
When, however, the term of two months has elapsed after he was notified, and
the owner refuses to do this, permission is granted to the emphyteuta to sell
his improvements to anyone whom he wishes, without the consent of the owner,
provided he disposes of them to such persons as are not usually forbidden by
emphyteutical contracts to make such purchases.
Where improvements are sold to others in the manner above stated, the owner
shall be required to accept the new emphyteuta, as, where the former one
prefers to transfer his right to persons who are not prohibited from receiving
it, but to those to whom it is permitted to do so, and are solvent according to
the emphyteutical law, the owners cannot oppose it, but must permit the new
emphyteuta to enter into possession, not by someone to whom they have farmed it
out, or by an attorney, but by themselves, or by their letters, or (if they
cannot, or are unwilling to do so) by their declaration made in this City
before the illustrious Superintendent of Taxes, or by an attestation made in
the province, in the presence of notaries, and before the Governors or
defenders of the same.
And in order to prevent owners tempted by avarice from extorting a large sum of
money on this account (which We have ascertained has been done up to the
present time), they shall not, in consideration of their signature or their
declarations, be permitted to receive more than the fiftieth part of the price,
or of the appraisement of the land which is transferred to the other party.
When the owner of the property absolutely refuses to accept the new emphyteuta
or purchaser of the improvements, and he neglects to do this within two months
after notice has been served upon him, the emphyteuta shall be permitted to
transfer to others, either his right or his improvements, even against the
consent of the owner. If, however, the emphyteuta should conduct himself
otherwise than is prescribed by Our Constitution, he shall forfeit his
emphyteutical right.
THE CODE OF OUR LORD AND MOST HOLY EMPEROR JUSTINIAN.
SECOND EDITION. BBOOOOKK VV..
TITLE I.
CONCERNING BETROTHALS, BETROTHAL PLEDGES, AND MARRIAGE BROKERS.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Annonaria.
She who has already been betrothed to one man is not forbidden to repudiate her
contract, and marry another.
2. The Emperor Constcmtius, and, the Csesar Constans, to Cozlius Probinus,
Prefect of the City.
If a man should, while residing in the same province agree to marry a girl and
fail to do so within the term of two years, and the girl, after the expiration
of the said time, should afterwards form an union with another, she will not be
guilty of fraud who, by contracting marriage, did not any longer suffer her
vows to be treated with contempt.1
3. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Eutro-ffius, Prsetorian
Prefect.
If, after the pledges of betrothal have been given, either of the parties
should die, We order the gifts to be returned, unless the deceased person had
already given cause for not celebrating the marriage.
1 No right of action for damages based on breach of promise of marriage was
recognized by the Civil Law, and it is also unknown to the European nations
whose jurisprudence is derived from it. This remedy, which affords such
favorable opportunities for the exercise of private blackmail and professional
rapacity, is of English origin. Unauthorized by the Common Law, it only
obtained a foothold in the English courts about the middle of the seventeenth
century, and when first brought to judicial notice, eminent jurists asserted
that there was no precedent for such a proceeding. This was probably due to the
fact that, by the Canon Law, a solemn promise to marry is practically
equivalent to actual matrimony.
In Scotland, where the intervention of neither priest nor magistrate is
essential, and the parties may merely declare their consent in the presence of
witnesses, an informal promise of marriage, followed by copulation, renders
them husband and wife without any further ceremony. (VideErskine, Principles of
the Law of Scotland, I, VI, 2.)
The abuse of the laws authorizing suits for breach of promise is far more
flagrant in the United States than elsewhere.ED.
4. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Marianus, Prsetorian Prefect.
When a father makes a contract with reference to the marriage of his daughter,
and is not able to carry it out on account of his death, whatever is proved to
have been agreed to by the betrothed parties shall remain inviolate, and any
compromise shown to have been made for the benefit of a minor by a guardian.or
curator shall be of no force or effect; for it would be extremely unjust for
the decision of a guardian or a curator which was perhaps purchased, to be
adopted in opposition to the wish of a father; especially as the greater number
of women are even found to favor opinions contrary to their own interests.
Given on the third of the Nonesof November, during the Consulate of Honorius,
Consul for the thirteenth time, and Theodosius, Consul for the tenth time, 422.
5. The Emperors Leo and Anthemius to Erythrius, Prsetorian Prefect.
A woman, who is her own mistress, is liable for double the amount of the
betrothal gift, that is to say, for what she received and as much again; but no
more than that, if, at the time she had completed her twenty-fifth year, or had
obtained indulgence on account of her age which was proved in a competent
court. She will be liable for the simple amount, that is to say, for only what
she received, if she was a minor, whether she was a virgin or a widow, and had
received the pledge of betrothal herself, or by her guardian or curator, or
anyone else.
It is, however, established that when either a father or a mother of lawful age
has either jointly or severally received a betrothal gift for their daughter,
or a grandfather or a great-grandfather has received it for a granddaughter or
a great-granddaughter, he shall be liable for double the amount.
We order that these rules shall be observed if the intended marriage has not
been prevented, on account of the person, or his or her condition, or any other
cause prohibited by the laws or general constitutions; for then We order that
the betrothal gift shall be returned as having been given without a cause, just
as if nothing had been done.
(1) We also add to this that, even when the intended marriage is not prohibited
by law, if, after the pledge has been given, the girl refuses to marry her
betrothed on account of his being of low character, or a spendthrift; or
because of his shameless conduct; or for the reason that he belongs to a
different religion or sect; or because he is a man incapable of performing the
sexual act (from which the hope of offspring arises) ; or on account of some
other just excuse; or if, indeed, it should be proved that before the betrothal
gift was made, the woman herself, or her parents knew these facts; they
themselves will be to blame. If, however, not being aware of them, they
accepted the betrothal gift, or if, after it was given, some good reason arose
to
induce them to change their minds, after returning the gift, they shall be free
from any penalty.
We decree that all these rules shall likewise be observed with ref-. erence to
men who are betrothed, whether they have received or bestowed such gifts, and
that the penalty of quadruple damages, which was mentioned in former laws by
which the amount of the betrothal gift was prescribed, shall be abolished;
unless something with reference to the said quadruple damages should be
especially agreed upon by the common consent of the contracting parties.
Where anything providing for a penalty exceeding that prescribed by the terms
of this law has been inserted in the stipulation, it shall be void, so far as
both parties are concerned, as when marriage is contracted absolute freedom
should exist.
Given on the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Martian and Zeno, 469.
TITLE II.
WHERE THE GOVERNOR OF A PROVINCE OR ANY OP His SUBORDINATES GIVE BETROTHAL
PLEDGES.
1. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Eutro-pius, Prsetorian
Prefect.
When anyone placed in a public position, and invested with the administration
of a province, who is able to inspire fear in parents, guardians, curators, or
the parties themselves that are about to contract matrimony, bestows betrothal
gifts, We order that if, hereafter, either the parents or the parties
themselves should change their minds, they shall not only be released from the
restraints of the law, but also be free from the prescribed penalty, and,
moreover, shall profit by the gifts bestowed, if they do not think that they
should be returned.
We desire that this law shall not only include public officials, but also their
children, grandchildren, relatives, and subordinates; that is to say, that it
shall apply to their counsellors and attendants, whom the said public officials
employ in the matter. We do not forbid the marriage to take place after the
functionary has relinquished his office, when the betrothed parties consent
that the obligation for the articles donated during the term of the persons of
whom We have spoken shall continue to exist.
Given at Thessalonica, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof July, under the
Consulate of Gratian, Consul for the fifth time, and Theodosius, 280.
TITLE III.
CONCERNING ANTENUPTIAL DONATIONS, OR THOSE GIVEN ON ACCOUNT OF MARRIAGE AND
BETROTHALS.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Metrodorus.It makes a great deal of
difference whether the property that a prospective husband donates to his
future wife is delivered to her,
and is afterwards received by him as dowry; or whether by giving it he intended
to increase the dowry, so that he might appear to have received a larger sum
than actually came into his hands.
In the first instance, the gift is not prohibited by law, and the property
given by way of donation is included in the dowry, and can be recovered by the
action of dowry. In the latter instance, however, the donation has no legal
effect, and what has been given as part of the dowry cannot be recovered.
2. The Emperor Alexander to Attains.
If you prove before the Governor of the province that you have given presents
to the parents of Eutychia, in order to be able to marry her, he will order
that unless Eutychia marries you what you have given shall be returned to you.
3. The Same to Marcella.
Where a promise has already been made by your brother on account of his
betrothal, even if it is included in the stipulation, it still cannot be
enforced, as the wife deceived her husband with reference to the dowry.
Therefore you can properly interpose an exception on the ground of bad faith
against an action brought under the stipulation.
4. The Emperor Gordian to Marcellus.
Anything which is given to a betrothed woman by her intended husband, under the
condition that she shall acquire the ownership of the property when the
marriage takes place, is without any effect.
5. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus to Theodora.
You cannot legally recover anything which the person who pretended to be
unmarried promised you as his betrothed, and who at the time that he asked you
to marry him had another wife at home, as you are not his betrothed, for the
reason that he already had a wife.
6. The Emperor Aurelian to "Donata.
As you state that a simple donation was made to you on the day of your
marriage, and as it seems to be doubtful whether it was given by your betrothed
or your husband, a distinction must be made; for if the gift was received in
your own house, it will be considered as an ante-nuptial donation. If, however,
your betrothed gave it in his house, it can be revoked, for you then were his
wife.
7. The Emperors Cams, Carinus, and Numerian to Luciana.
If,when ante-nuptial gifts are made, it is agreed, and the agreement is reduced
to writing, that if anything should happen to prevent one of the contracting
parties from carrying out his or her intention, and the marriage from taking
place, then whatever was given shall be returned to whoever gave it, or to his
heir; he who obtains the estate of the person from whom the girl received the
gifts under the abovementioned condition can recover the same by law.
8. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Euphrosina.
Where anyone, over the age of twenty-five years, before marriage, has (even
previous to the betrothal) given to his intended wife a tract of land, and she
has been placed in possession of the same, it is a positive and clear rule of
law that he cannot alienate it afterwards under any title, if he lives; or
leave it by will, if he dies.
9. The Same Emperors and Ctesars to Julian.
As you acknowledge that you have given a present to the betrothed of your son,
such a perfected donation which your consent and the authority of the law have
ratified cannot be rescinded by Our Rescript.
10. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Dionysius.
If the betrothed of your daughter gave her a slave, and you, by way of
liberality, presented her with beasts of burden, and the marriage did not take
place, and he, contrary to the provisions of the law, took away what he gave, a
reciprocal restitution of what was donated on both sides will not take place,
but an action for the recovery of what he unlawfully removed will lie.
11. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Nea.
If your betrothed, as a mark of his generosity, gave you property which
belonged to him, the donation does not become void for the reason that he was
afterwards killed by the enemy.
12. The Same Emperors and Czesars to Timothea and Cleotina.
If your mother has given certain lands to the betrothed or husband of her
daughter without stating any condition as to their recovery, and has placed him
in the possession of the same, and the marriage should be dissolved by divorce,
the donation, being perfect, will not be annulled.
13. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Alexander.
The creditors of a husband cannot sue his betrothed to obtain the property
given to her by way of donation, unless they can prove that it was previously
encumbered to them.
14. The Same, and the Csesars, to Aurelia.
If the betrothed of your daughter gave her some slaves, with the consent of her
mother, they having been received as dowry without any appraisement, and he
should die after marriage, the mother, who was also the heir of the deceased
husband, will not make proper restitution by offering their value in their
stead.
15. The Emperor Constantine to Maximus, Urban Prefect.
As the opinion of the ancients, which declared that donations made to a
betrothed woman were valid, even if the marriage was not cele-
brated, is displeasing to Us, We order that anything legally given by way of
donation to betrothed persons by one another shall be subject to the following
rule, namely, that whether it was given in consideration of marriage or not, or
whether the parties are under the control of their parents or independent, the
gift shall be considered as having been given in consideration of future
marriage, if it is bestowed with the consent of their parents; and if, indeed,
the man or his parents are unwilling to consent to the marriage, whatever has
been donated by him cannot be recovered if it has been delivered, and if any of
the property should be in the hands of the donor, it shall be transferred to
the betrothed woman, and her heirs, without any attempt at evasion. Where,
however, the betrothed woman, or the person under whose control she is, is
responsible for the marriage not being contracted, then the gift shall be
returned to the betrothed man himself, or to his heirs, without any deduction,
by means of a personal action for recovery, or by an equitable action in rem.
This rule must also be observed where the donation is made by the woman to her
betrothed.
Given at Rome, on the sixth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of
Constantine, Consul for the fifth time, and Licinius, 319.
16. The Same to Tiberianus, Vicegerent of the Spains.
If, after a donation has been made by a man to his betrothed, and the kiss has
taken place, one of the parties should happen to die before the marriage, We
order that half of the property which was given shall belong to the survivor,
and the other half to the heirs of the deceased, no matter to what degree they
may belong, or under what right they may succeed; so that the donation may
appear to stand so far as half of it is concerned, and be annulled with
reference to the other half. If the kiss did not take place, and either of the
parties should die, the donation shall be wholly void, and be returned to the
donor and his heirs. Whether the kiss took place or not, if either of the
parties should die before the marriage, and anything was given to the man by
way of donation (which rarely happens) it shall be entirely annulled, and the
ownership of the property bestowed shall be transferred to the woman who
donated it, or to her successors.1
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Nepotian
and Pacatus, 336.
17. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Hierus, Prse-torian Prefect.
The interests of female minors are very properly provided for, when they are
deprived of the assistance of their fathers, by confirming donations made
before marriage, where the acknowledgment of the parties has been omitted.
1 Among the Romans, the kiss given to the prospective bride was, as appears
from the text, an essential part of the ceremony of betrothal; and survives in
that now usually bestowed immediately after the marriage has been
solemnized.ED.
Given at Constantinople, on the tenth of the Kalendsof Marc'h, during the
Consulate of Taurus and Felix, 428.
18. The Emperor Zeno to Sebastian, Prsstorian Prefect.
If a father, after having had children by a former marriage, should marry a
second time, or not, he cannot be compelled to leave any part of an ante-
nuptial donation to the children of his first wife, which either he himself, or
someone else gave to the said wife the mother of their common children; as a
mother cannot be compelled to preserve anything for any children by her first
marriage (after she has contracted a second one) out of the dowry which she
gave to their father, or that any other person gave him in her behalf, and with
all the more reason if she did not take a second husband.
19. The Emperor Justinian to Archelaus, Prsetorian Prefect.
If, during marriage, the wife, or anyone else in her name, should form the
design to increase her dowry, it shall still be permitted the husband, or
anyone else in his behalf, to increase the antenuptial donation to the extent
that the dowry is augmented; and it cannot be objected to generosity of this
kind that it was forbidden at the time of the marriage, for indulgence should
be granted to the common consent of the parties, for fear that if the power of
increasing the donation is refused, the increase of the dowry may be interfered
with.
We order that the same rule shall also apply to those marriages in which it
sometimes happens that no ante-nuptial donation is given, but that the woman
only offers a dowry to her husband; so that when she increases her dowry, the
husband shall likewise be permitted to increase his donation to his wife, to
the same extent that the dowry is known to be increased, if the parties have
consented to the return or retention of the increased dowry or donation;
whether this has been done in compliance with the agreements prescribed by the
ancients, or with those at present established, which, having reference to the
ante-nuptial donation and the constitution of the dowry, were entered into at
the commencement of the marriage.
Again, the rights of hypothecation, which arise from the increase of the dowry
or donation, acquire their force from the date when the said hypothecation was
contracted, and should not be referred to the time of the former dowry, or to
that of the ante-nuptial donation.
If, however, on the other hand, both the husband and wife should agree to
diminish the dowry and the ante-nuptial donation, they shall be permitted to
diminish the latter in the same way that the diminution of the dowry is
effected, and any agreements entered into with reference to the diminution of
both shall be understood to be valid and legal, except, for instance, in those
cases in which either the husband, having children by a former marriage,
marries again, or the wife in like manner, while children by a former marriage
are living, Unites herself to a second husband; for in this second marriage,
whether the husband or the wife, or both of them are concerned (if this should
happen), We decree that any diminution of the dowry or
the ante-nuptial donation shall be prohibited, in order to avoid any advantage
being taken of children by a former marriage.
Extract from Novel 97, Chapter VII. Latin Text.
Now, however, if one party makes an increase the other must also do so, and if
the husband is not prevented by his debts, the increase can be made of any kind
of property whatsoever. But if he is in debt, in order to avoid any suspicion
of fraud against his creditors, all his immovable property will be liable for
the increase of the dowry, for if the woman, while owning real estate, should
give movable property to increase her dowry, she cannot avail herself of her
privilege against other creditors with reference to this portion of it.
20. The Emperor Justinian to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
As many complaints have been made to Us against husbands who, for the purpose
of deceiving their wives, have made them donations which from ancient times
have been designated ante-nuptial, but have neglected to have them recorded in
order that they may remain imperfect, and they themselves enjoy the advantages
of the dowry, while their wives are left without any remedy, so far as the
antenuptial donation is concerned, We order that this abuse shall be corrected
by changing the name of the gift, which shall hereafter be called not an ante-
nuptial donation, but a donation on account of marriage.
Therefore, as a woman is allowed to give a dowry to her husband during
marriage, why should the husband only be permitted to give a donation to his
wife before marriage? Can this difference be considered reasonable, since,
because of the weakness of the sex it is better to come to the relief of wives
than of husbands? For as the dowry can only be given on account of marriage,
and none can be held to exist without it, and marriage can even be celebrated
without a dowry, so, in the case of gifts donated by husbands, or by others in
their behalf, the latter should be absolutely free to make such donations
during marriage, because a present of this kind can be regarded as an advantage
to be enjoyed by the wife, and not as a simple present; and for this reason the
founders of the ancient law included dowries among donations.
Hence if an ante-nuptial donation does not differ either in name or fact from a
dowry, why should it not, in like manner, be given during marriage? Therefore,
We order that all persons, whether they have contracted marriage before or
afterwards, shall be permitted to give donations to their wives on account of
the gift of the dowry, in order that they may not be understood to be simple
gifts, but bestowed in consideration of the dowry and the marriage.
Extract from Novel 61, Chapter I. Latin Text.
An action in rem,founded on a donation of this kind, is granted to the woman
against all possessors.
END OP THE EXTRACT.
THE TEXT OF THE CODE FOLLOWS.
Simple donations are not made on account of marriage, but they are forbidden to
be made for this reason; lest this may be done for other considerations, for
instance, on account of licentiousness, or because of the poverty of one of the
parties, and not be attributable to the affection growing out of the marriage
itself; therefore if the dowry has already been given, and the husband, not
having made an antenuptial donation, prefers to make his wife a present
(provided it does not exceed the amount of the dowry, and he states that the
said present is not made as a simple donation, but on account of the dowry
which has already been given, and which itself amounts to as much as the
donation), he shall be permitted to do so, and the said present shall be
inserted in the dotal contracts. Where, however, a donation of this kind has
taken place, even though the dotal instrument may previously have been drawn
up, and no mention of a post nuptial donation included therein, it shall be
understood to have been agreed upon in accordance with the provisions of the
dotal contract, to enable both the dowry as well as the donation to stand upon
the same footing, in order that the Leonine Constitution (which has reference
to the quality of the agreement, and not to the amount of the property, but to
the shares thereof), may, in cases of this kind, remain intact, and not only be
observed without alteration, but that any ambiguity which it contains may be
removed by the interpretation which We have made. For where unequal contracts
have been entered into, We decree that the greater part of the benefit shall be
reduced, so as to be equal to the less, and both parties enjoy the smaller
amount to the same extent.
Extract from Novel 91, Chapter II. Latin Text.
When a dowry has been given, it should be followed by a donation on account of
marriage. Moreover, if the woman is ready to pay her dowry, and her husband
refuses to accept it, she can call witnesses to establish this fact, and if the
dowry is composed of personal property, she can deposit it, after sealing it
up; or having appeared in court, she can demand that her husband be notified,
and, under such circumstances, the acceptance of the donation cannot be
declined. If, however, there is any delay in giving the husband the dowry, the
donation can also be refused.
END OF THE EXTRACT.
THE TEXT OF THE CODE FOLLOWS.
(1) In like manner, if a gift of this kind should be made (which was formerly
designated an ante-nuptial donation but is now styled one on account of
marriage), and it has not been evidenced by the execution of an instrument, it
will be lawful to do this during marriage; and no objection can be raised on
account of the marriage having taken place. If, however, this is permitted to
be done after marriage, much more reason exists for the instrument to be drawn
up.
Moreover, the Constitution which We have promulgated with ref-
erence to the increase of dowries and ante-nuptial donations shall remain
intact and inviolate; and all other laws either enacted by the ancients or by
Us, with reference to simple donations made between husband and wife during
marriage, shall remain in full force.
Extract from Novel 127, Chapter I. Latin Text.
The result of this is that a gift in consideration of marriage is effected by
means of a special contract, which does not require to be recorded, even if the
donation is bestowed by another, provided it is done in the name of the
husband, and he himself mentions this in the contract. This rule also applies
to the woman. If, however, the husband, or anyone else who made the donation,
did not have it recorded, and the amount is legal, and by the dotal agreement
it is granted to the husband, he will not be entitled to any action with
reference to it. A father is not compelled to preserve for the children by a
former marriage a donation which he made to his wife in consideration of
marriage, even if he should marry again. The case, however, is otherwise when a
part of the dowry remains in the hands of the husband, or a part of the
donation in the hands of the wife; for then it should be preserved for the
children by the former marriage.
Extract from Novel 127, Chapter II. Latin Text.
At present, a diminution is forbidden to avoid fraud being committed against
the children by a former marriage; and as much must be given to each of them as
the husband gave to his second wife, even though one child may have received a
smaller amount.
The same rule also applies to the woman.
TITLE IV. CONCERNING MARRIAGE.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Porcius.
When a question arises with reference to the marriage of a young girl, and the
guardian, the mother, and the relatives cannot agree as to the selection of a
husband, the decision of the Governor of the province must be obtained.
2. The Same to Trophima.
If your father consented to your marriage, it makes no difference, so far as
you are concerned, if he did not sign the marriage contract.
3. The Same to Valeria,.
You can, before a competent judge, accuse a freedman who has dared to marry his
patroness, or the daughter, the wife, the granddaughter, or the great-
granddaughter of his patron, in order that a decision may be rendered in
accordance with the customs of the present times, which very properly regard an
union of this kind as odious.
4. The Emperor Alexander to Perpetuus.
Children cannot marry the concubines of their ascendants, for the reason that
an act of this kind when committed by them is not praiseworthy, and indicates a
lack of filial duty. Those who violate this law are guilty of the crime of
fornication.
5. The Same to Maxima.
If (as you allege) your husband's father, under whose power he was, having
learned of your marriage, did not oppose it, you should not fear that he will
not recognize his grandson.
6. The Emperor Gordian to Valeria.
When, contrary to the command of the Emperor, a marriage with an official has
taken place in a province with the consent of the woman, still, if she remains
of the same mind after the man has relinquished his employment, the marriage
becomes legal, and hence any children who have been conceived and born of it
are legitimate, as is set forth in the opinion of the most learned Paulus.
7. The Same to Aper.
If (as you state) after a complaint has been made to you by your daughter
against her husband, the marriage was dissolved, and the parties again became
united without your consent, the marriage is illegitimate, as it was contracted
without the consent of the father, under whose control the woman was, and
therefore, as your daughter does not claim her dowry, you will not be prevented
from bringing suit to recover it.
'8. The Same to Romanus.
In questions relating to marriage, neither the authority of the curator (which
only extends to the administration of the property of the minor) nor that of
the blood-relatives or connections can be interposed, but the will of the
person whose marriage in question should be considered.
9. The Emperor Probus to Fortunatus.
When, with the knowledge of your neighbors or others, you keep your wife at
home for the purpose of having children, and a daughter is born of this
marriage, although neither the nuptial contract nor the birth certificate of
the daughter may have been published, the fact of the marriage and the
legitimate birth of your daughter are none the less established on that
account.
10. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Paulina.
As you allege that you did not attain to the rank of an illustrious woman
because your father was a senator, but for the reason that you contracted
marriage with a member of the Senate, you will lose the exalted position which
you obtained from your first husband, and be
reduced to your former status, if you should subsequently marry a man of
inferior degree.
11. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Alexander.
If your wife is detained by her parents without her consent, and Our friend the
Governor of the province is notified of the fact, he will grant your request,
and having caused the woman to be produced, you can consult her wishes in the
matter.
12. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Sabinus.
The policy of the law does not permit that even a son under paternal control
shall be compelled to marry against his consent. Therefore if you observe the
ordinary legal precepts, you will not be prevented from marrying the wife whom
you may choose, if you desire to do so, provided, however, that your father
consents to the marriage.
13. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Onesimus.
Instruments drawn up for the proof of marriage are not suitable for that
purpose when the ceremony does not take place and they contain what is not
true; but where no instruments have been drawn up, a marriage which has been
contracted with the requisite formalities is not void, since by the failure to
reduce the contract to writing, the other evidence of its solemnization is not
invalidated.
14. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Titius.
No one can be compelled either to contract marriage in the beginning, or to
renew it after it has once been dissolved. Therefore you understand that the
unrestrained power of dissolving and contracting marriage cannot be rendered a
matter of necessity.
15. The Same Emperors and Csssars to Tatian.
Anyone who has manumitted a slave is not forbidden to marry her, if he does not
belong to one of those classes of persons especially prohibited from doing so;
and it is absolutely certain that legitimate children can be born to a father
by such a marriage.
Extract from Novel 78, Chapter III. Latin Text.
By the new law, however, no rank prevents anyone from marrying his freedwoman,
provided dotal instruments are drawn up with reference to the marriage.
16. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Rhodonus.
It is proper that a father who exposed his daughter, who was taken by you and
brought up at your expense, and under your care, should consent for her to be
married to your son. If, however, he refuses to give his consent, he should be
compelled to do so only in case he indemnifies you for the maintenance which
you provided for his daughter.
17. The Same Emperors and Csesars.
No one shall be permitted to contract marriage with his daughter, his
granddaughter, or his great-granddaughter, his mother, his grandmother, or his
great-grandmother; and, in the collateral line, with his paternal or maternal
aunt, his sister, the daughter of his sister, or her granddaughter; nor with
the daughter of his brother, or his granddaughter; and among connections by
marriage, with his stepdaughter, his stepmother, his daughter-in-law, his
mother-in-law, or any other persons prohibited by ancient law, with whom We
desire that all persons shall abstain from contracting marriage.
18. The Emperors Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian to the Senate.
Widows under the age of twenty-five, even though they may have obtained the
freedom of emancipation, still cannot marry a second time without the consent
of their fathers. If, however, in the choice of a husband, the desire of the
woman is opposed to that of her father, and other relatives, it is established
(just as has already been decreed with reference to the marriage of virgins),
that judicial authority should be interposed for the purpose of examination,
and if the parties are equal in family, and in morals, he shall be considered
preferable whom the woman has selected for herself. But in order to prevent
those who are nearest in degree to the succession of widows, from hindering the
latter from contracting honorable marriage, where any suspicion of this kind
arises, We desire that authority of the courts should be invoked to prevent her
estate from descending to them, if death should occur.
Given on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of
Gratian, Consul for the second time, and Probus, 371.
19. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Eutychianus, Prse-torian Prefect.
Marriage between first cousins is permitted by this salutary law, so that the
former one having been annulled, and the temptation to calumny having been
restrained, marriage between such cousins shall be considered lawful, whether
they are the children of two brothers, or of two sisters, or of brother and
sister; and any children by such a marriage shall be legitimate and can become
the heirs of their parents.
Given during the Consulate of Stilicho, Consul for the second time, and
Anthemius, 405.
20. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Theodore, Praetorian Prefect.
The wishes of the father are to be considered in case of the marriage of
daughters under paternal control. Where, however, a girl is her own mistress,
and is under twenty-five years of age, the consent of her father must be
obtained. Where she is deprived of the aid of her father, the consent of her
mother and her kindred, as well as of herself, will be necessary.
If, however, having lost both her parents, she has been placed under the
protection of a curator, and a dispute should arise between several honorable
candidates for marriage, so that it may be doubtful to which one it would be
advantageous for the girl to be united, and she, through modesty, is unwilling
to express her preference in the presence of her relatives, the judge is
authorized to decide to which suitor it is best that she be married.
21. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Bassus, Prse-torian Prefect.
We grant free permission to soldiers, from those of no military rank up to that
of protector, to contract marriage with freeborn women, without any of the
usual formalities.
22. The Same to Hierius, Prsetorian Prefect.
If the instruments relating to an ante-nuptial contract or a dowry are lacking,
and the ceremony and other formalities associated with marriage have been
omitted, let no one think that, on account of this neglect, marriage which has
otherwise been legally performed is not valid; or that on this account children
born of it can be deprived of their rights as legitimate; for among persons of
equal standing, whose union is not prevented by any law, matrimonial union will
take place by their own consent and the testimony of their friends.1
Given at Constantinople, on the tenth of the Kalendsof March, during the
Consulate of Felix and Taurus, 428.
23. The Emperor Justinian to Demosthenes, Prsetorian Prefect.
Believing that it is a peculiar duty of Imperial beneficence at all times not
only to consider the convenience of Our subjects, but also to attempt to supply
their needs, We have determined that the errors of women on account of which,
through the weakness of their sex, they have chosen to be guilty of
dishonorable conduct, should be corrected by a display of proper moderation,
and that they should by no means be deprived of the hope of an improvement of
status, so that, taking this into consideration, they may the more readily
abandon the improvident and disgraceful choice of life which they have made.
For We believe that the benevolence of God, and His exceeding clemency towards
the human race, should be imitated by Us (as far as Our nature will permit),
who is always willing to pardon the sins daily committed by man, accept Our
repentance, and bring us to a better condition. Hence, We should seem to be
unworthy of pardon Ourselves were We to fail to act in this manner with
reference to those subject to Our empire.
(1) Therefore, as it would be unjust for slaves, to whom their liberty has been
given, to be raised by Imperial indulgence to the status of men who are born
free, and, by the effect of an Imperial privilege of this kind, be placed in
the same position as if they had
1 "Consensus non concubitus facit matrimonium."ED.
never been slaves, but were freeborn; and that women who had devoted themselves
to theatrical performances, and, afterwards having become disgusted with this
degraded status, abandoned their infamous occupation and obtained better
repute, should have no hope of obtaining any benefit from the Emperor, who had
the power to place them in the condition in which they could have remained, if
they had never been guilty of dishonorable acts, We, by the present most
merciful law, grant them this Imperial benefit under the condition that where,
having deserted their evil and disgraceful condition, they embrace a more
proper life, and conduct themselves honorably, they shall be permitted to
petition Us to grant them Our Divine permission to contract legal marriage when
they are unquestionably worthy of it. Those who may be united with them need be
under no apprehension, nor think that such marriages are void by the provisions
of former laws; but, on the other hand, they shall remain valid, and be
considered just as if the women had never previously led dishonorable lives,
whether their husbands are invested with office, or, for some other reason, are
prohibited from marrying women of the stage, provided, however, that the
marriage can be proved by dotal contracts reduced to writing. For women of this
kind having been purified from all blemishes, and, as it were, restored to the
condition in which they were born, We desire that no disgraceful epithet be
applied to them, and that no difference shall exist between them and those who
have never committed a similar breach of morality.
(2) Children born of a marriage of this kind shall be legitimate, and the
proper heirs of their father, even though he may have other lawful heirs by a
former marriage; so that such children may also, without any obstacle, be able
to acquire the estates of their parents, either ab intestato,or under the terms
of a will.
(3) If, however, women of this description, after an Imperial Rescript has been
granted them in accordance with their request, should defer contracting
marriage, We order that their. reputations shall, nevertheless, remain intact,
as in the case of all others who may desire to transfer their property to
anyone; and that they shall be competent to receive anything bequeathed to
them, in accordance with law, or an estate which may descend to them on the
ground of intestacy.
Extract from Novel 51. Latin Text.
These privileges shall be granted them, even if they may have sworn that they
will continue in their former profession, because it is expressly stated by the
laws that an oath to perform an unlawful act must not be observed, and that the
penalty for perjury, if any exists, shall be inflicted upon him who exacts an
oath of this description.

(4) We also decree that such of these women as have obtained a privilege from
the Emperor shall occupy the same position as those
who have obtained some other benefit which was not bestowed by the sovereign,
but was acquired by them as a voluntary donation before their marriage; for, by
a concession of this kind, every other stigma on account of which women are
forbidden to contract lawful marriage with certain men is absolutely removed.
(5) To this We add that when the daughters of women of this kind are born after
the purification of their mother from the disgrace of her former life, they
shall not be considered as the children of females belonging to the stage, or
be subject to the laws which forbid certain men to marry such women. Where,
however, they were born before that time, they shall be permitted to petition
the Emperor for a Rescript, which should be granted without any opposition, by
means of which they may be permitted to marry, just as if they were not the
daughters of actresses; and those men shall not be prohibited from marrying
them who are forbidden to take as wives girls belonging to the stage, either on
account of their own rank, or for some other reason; provided, however, that in
every instance, dotal instruments in writing are executed by the parties
concerned.
(6) If, however, a girl born of a theatrical mother, who practiced her
profession until the time of her death, should, after her mother's decease,
petition for Imperial indulgence, and obtain it, she shall be freed from the
blemish of her mother's reputation, and herself be granted permission to marry;
and she also can without the fear of former laws be united in matrimony with
those who not long ago were prohibited from marrying the daughter of an
actress.
(7) Moreover, We have thought that what was prescribed by former laws (although
this was somewhat obscure) should be abolished, namely, that a marriage
contracted between persons of unequal rank shall not be considered valid,
unless dotal instruments with reference to it were executed. When, however,
this does not take place, such marriages shall still be absolutely valid,
without any distinction of persons, provided the women are free and freeborn,
and that no suspicion of any criminal or incestuous union arises, for We, under
all circumstances, annul criminal and incestuous unions, as well as those which
were especially prohibited by the provisions of former laws; with the
exception, however, of such as We authorize by the present decree, and direct
shall be considered legal, in accordance with the rights of marriage.1
Extract from Novel 117, Chapter IV. Latin Text.
Those who are invested with exalted dignity, up to persons styled illustrious,
cannot legally contract matrimony, unless dotal instruments have been drawn up
in writing, although marriages previously contracted will stand. Barbarians are
excepted from this rule, but all others can legally marry under the inducement
of affection alone.
1 These laws were unquestionably promulgated in a vain attempt to render the
Empress Theodora, who had been an actress, and whose vices had been the scandal
of the Empire, respectable._ED.
THE TEXT OF THE CODE FOLLOWS.
(8) Therefore these matters having been settled in this manner, by this general
law which must hereafter be observed, We order that any such unions which have
subsequently been made shall be regulated in accordance with the aforesaid
provisions; so that where anyone has married a wife of this kind during Our
reign (as has already been stated), and has children by her, they shall be
legitimate, and be entitled to succeed to their father ab intestato,as well as
under a will, and the wife, as well as any children hereafter born of her,
shall also be considered legitimate.
24. The Same to the Senate.
We order that if anyone should, in any agreement whatsoever, whether it is
drawn up for the purpose of giving something, or for the performance of some
act, or for not giving anything, or for the non-performance of some act, either
refer to the time of his marriage or merely mention the marriage itself, the
condition of the contract shall not be understood to have been complied with,
or not to have been dispensed with, unless the ceremony of marriage actually
takes place; and that the age at which marriage can be solemnized, which in the
case of a female is after she has completed her twelfth year, and in case of a
male after he has completed his fourteenth year, should not be considered, but
the time when the marriage was performed shall only be taken into account; for
in this way all disputes arising from the ancient law are disposed of, and the
immense number of volumes on this subject are reduced to very few.
25. The Same to Julian, Prsetorian Prefect.
The question was discussed by the ancients whether the children of insane
parents, under whose control they were, could marry. Almost all the legal
authorities admitted that the daughter of an insane person could marry, for
they thought it was sufficient if the father did not object, but it was doubted
whether a son could do so. Ulpian refers to a Constitution of the Emperor
Marcus, which does not mention lunatics, but in general terms alludes to
children of persons of weak minds, whether they are males or females, who
contract marriage; and he states that they can do so without applying to the
Emperor.
Another doubt arises from this constitution, that is to say, whether what it
provides, with reference to persons of weak minds, should also apply to those
who are insane; and whether the children of lunatics are also entitled to
relief, just as those of a person of feeble intellect. Therefore, for the
purpose of disposing of these doubts and difficulties, We order that whatever
appears to be lacking in the Constitution of the Divine Marcus shall be
supplied by the following provision, that is to say, that not only the children
of a person of weak intellect, but also those of one who is insane, of either
sex, can legally contract marriage; and that the dowry, as well as the ante-
nuptial donation, shall be furnished by their curators. The amount of the
dowry, as well as that of the ante-nuptial donation, must, in this Imperial
City,
be determined by the estimate of the most excellent Urban Prefect, and in the
provinces by that of the illustrious Governors, or by the bishops of the
various dioceses; and the curator of the person who has lost his mind or has
become insane should be present, as well as those highest in rank in their
families, so that nothing may arise in a case of this kind, either in this
Imperial City, or in the provinces, to cause any loss of the property of said
insane person, or of him of enfeebled intellect; and these proceedings shall be
undertaken gratuitously, so that a human misfortune of this description may not
be aggravated by any expense.
26. The Same to Julian, Prsetorian Prefect.
If anyone should grant freedom to his foster-daughter, and marry her, a doubt
arose among the ancients whether a marriage of this kind should be considered
lawful or not. Therefore We, desiring to resolve this long-existing doubt,
decree that such a marriage is not prohibited, for if these marriages have
their origin in affection, and We find nothing impious or contrary to law in
such a union, why should We think that they ought not to be allowed? No man can
be found who is so wicked as to afterwards marry a girl whom, in the first
place, he treated as his daughter; but it should be believed that he did not
originally bring her up as his daughter, but gave her her freedom, and
afterwards deemed her worthy to be married to him. A woman should, by all
means, be prevented from marrying her godfather who received her in baptism
whether she is his foster-child or not, as nothing else can be so productive of
paternal affection and just prohibition of marriage as a tie of this kind, by
means of which, through the mediation of God, the souls of the parties in
question are united.
27. The Same to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
We order that marriages which take place between men and women who are more or
less than fifty or sixty years of age, and which are prohibited by the Lex
Julia et Papia,cannot be prevented in any way, or on either side, where the men
consent.
28. The Same to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
Where a man has a wife who is a freedwoman, and afterwards becomes illustrious
by being raised to the dignity of Senator, the question is raised by Ulpian
whether the marriage is dissolved by his promotion, because the Lex Papiadoes
not permit marriages to exist between senators and freedwomen. Hence We,
following the judgment of God, do not permit that, in one and the same
marriage, the happiness of the husband should become the misfortune of his
wife, so that his wife may be debased to the extent that he is elevated, and
indeed that she should absolutely be lost to him; therefore, as severity of
this kind ought not to exist in our times, and the marriage should stand, and
the wife rise with her husband and share his distinction, the marriage shall
remain valid, and shall be, to no extent, affected by an occurrence of this
description.
In like manner, where the daughter of a private person marries a freedman, and
her father is afterwards raised to the senatorial dignity, the cruel provision
of the Papian Law is silent on this point, and the marriage celebrated between
the daughter of one who has become a senator and a freedman must not be
dissolved on this account, so that the prosperity of the father-in-law may not
be attained without the loss of his son-in-law; for it is better that the
harshness of the Papian Law should be mitigated in both instances, rather than,
by observing it, the marriages of men should be annulled, not on account of any
vice of the wife or the husband, but because of the good fortune of both, for,
as this defect proceeds from one source, the result is that it is removed by
one law.
TITLE V.
CONCERNING MARRIAGES WHICH ARE INCESTUOUS AND
VOID.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Amphigonus.
If your freedwoman, who is also your wife, leaves you without your consent, she
cannot marry another if you desire to retain her as your wife.
2. The Emperors DiocletioM and Maximum to Sebastiana.
It is a matter of common notoriety that no one who is subject to the
jurisdiction of the Roman Empfre can have two wives at once; as, by the Edict
of the Praetor, men of this description are branded with infamy, and a
competent judge will not suffer a crime of this kind to go unpunished.
3. The Emperor Constantine to Patroclus.
Marriage to a female slave cannot exist, for only slaves are born of an union
of this kind. Therefore, We order that decurions, induced by licentious desires
for female slaves, shall not resort to the houses of powerful men; and if a
decurion, without the knowledge of the stewards or superintendents of the same,
shall be found living with the female slave of another, We order that the woman
shall be sentenced by the judge to the mines, and the decurion himself shall be
deported to an island; and if he has been freed from the control of his father,
and has neither children, parents, nor any near relatives who can be called to
his succession as heirs at law, his property shall be confiscated for the
benefit of the city in which he held the office of decurion. If, however, the
stewards or superintendents of the house in which the offence was committed
were aware of it, or, after it had been discovered, were unwilling to make it
known, it is proper that they also should be sentenced to the mines.
If the owner of the house permitted this to be done, or, after having heard of
it, concealed it, and the act was committed in the country, the land, together
with the slaves and the cattle, as well as
all other property requisite for agriculture, shall be confiscated to the
Treasury. If, however, the act was committed in a city, We order that half of
all the property shall be confiscated by way of increasing the penalty, because
the offence, having been perpetrated in the owner's residence, he was unwilling
to disclose it as soon as it became known to him.
4. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Andro-macus, Count of
Private Affairs.
When anyone marries contrary to the provisions of the laws, or in violation of
the Mandates and Constitutions of the Emperors, nothing shall be acquired
through such a marriage, whether an antenuptial donation of any kind was given
before or afterwards. We order that everything which was bestowed by the
liberality of one of the parties upon the other shall be taken from him or her,
as being unworthy of having it, and confiscated to the Treasury; there being
excepted from this rule such men and women as, through some serious mistake,
which was neither affected nor simulated, have been deceived for any good
cause, or have erred on account of their youth. It has, however, been decided
that they alone shall be free from the restraints of Our law who, having
discovered their error, or having arrived at their majority, take steps to
dissolve an union of this description without delay.
5. The Same to Cynegius.
We absolutely prohibit marriage with the wife of a brother, or with two
sisters, even where a previous marriage has been dissolved in any way
whatsoever.
6. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Eutychianus, Prss-torian Prefect.
If anyone should pollute himself by an incestuous or prohibited marriage, he
can retain possession of his own property as long as he lives, but he must not
think that he has a wife, or any children by her, nor can he, during his
lifetime, donate anything to the aforesaid persons even through the
interposition of a third party; nor can he leave them any property at the time
of his death. If a dowry has been formally given or promised, it shall, in
compliance with the ancient laws, be confiscated to Our Treasury. He can
bequeath nothing to strangers by his will, but, whether he dies testate or
intestate, his heirs will succeed him by law, provided he has children born in
just and lawful wedlock; that is to say, if he has among his descendants a son,
a daughter, a grandson, a granddaughter, a great-grandson, or a great-
granddaughter; or among his ascendants, a father, a mother, a grandfather, or a
grandmother; or in the collateral line, a brother, a sister, a paternal uncle,
or a paternal aunt. He shall have a right to make a will, and leave what he
wishes only to such persons as he may select, and who, according to the tenor
of Our Imperial Rescript, are entitled to the succession.
Where any of the persons whom We have mentioned is shown to have advised the
contraction of the incestuous marriage, he shall be absolutely excluded from
the estate of the deceased, and the heir who is next in degree shall succeed in
his stead.
Moreover, what We have provided with reference to men shall also be observed
with regard to women who have polluted themselves with such marriages as those
above mentioned. When, however, the persons referred to as being next of kin
are not living, the estate shall be confiscated to Our Treasury.
Given at Constantinople, on the sixth of the Idesof December, during the
Consulate of Arcadius, Consul for the fourth time, and Honorius, Consul for the
third time, 396.
Extract from Novel 12, Chapter I. Latin Text.
The penalty imposed upon anyone who contracts an incestuous marriage is the
confiscation of his property, including not only the dowry, but everything
else, exile, and the loss of rank (if he enjoys it), and also scourging when he
is of inferior degree; and any woman who commits a similar offence shall suffer
the same punishment. If the offender has legitimate children, who become their
own masters by the crime of their father, his property shall pass to them,
provided that he is supported by them, but if there are no children, it shall
be confiscated to the Treasury.
Extract from Novel 89, Last Chapter.
Children should not be called natural who are born of an execrable, incestuous
or prohibited marriage, but should be considered as unworthy of inheriting
their father's estate, or of being supported by him.
7. The Emperors Valentinian and Martian to Palladius, Praetorian Prefect.
We do not understand a low or abject woman to be one who, although she may be
poor, is descended from freeborn parents. Therefore We have decided that
Senators and persons of the highest rank can marry women who are the children
of freeborn parents, even though they are poor; and that no distinction exists
between freeborn women and those who are more opulent, on account of the good
fortune of the latter. We only consider those women to be low and abject
persons who are slaves, the daughters of slaves, freedwomen, and the daughters
of freedwomen, actresses, and their daughters, the daughters of tavern-keepers,
of proprietors of houses of prostitution, and of gladiators; or women who make
their bodies articles of merchandise; therefore it is only proper for Us to
forbid the marriage of Senators with women belonging to the classes which We
have just enumerated.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Nonesof April, during the
Consulate of Jstius, and Asterius, 454.
8. The Emperor Zeno to Epinicus, Prsstorian Prefect.
Although certain Egyptians have married the wives of their deceased brothers,
for the reason that they were said to have remained virgins after their
marriage, being of the opinion that sexual intercourse had not taken place
between them (which has been held by certain legal authorities), and that, on
this account, no marriage was considered to have been actually consummated; and
while matrimonial unions of this description which took place under such
circumstances were valid, still, We order by the present law that, if any such
marriages should be celebrated, those who contract them, as well as their
children, shall be subject to the provisions of the ancient laws, and that the
marriages shall not, according to the example of the Egyptians above referred
to, be considered to be either valid, or capable of being rendered so.
9. The Emperor Anastasius to Severianus, Pr&torian Prefect.
All persons governed by Our Empire are notified that they must abstain from
incestuous marriages. For We decree that all rescripts, pragmatic sanctions, or
impious constitutions which, during the period of tyranny, permitted certain
persons to give the name of marriage to wicked unions, and allowed anyone to
marry his niece, his sister, or his sister-in-law, and to live in the basest
associations with her, or sanctioned any other unions of this kind, to be of no
force or effect, lest, by culpable dissimulation, such abominable license may
be confirmed.
TITLE VI.
CONCERNING THE PROHIBITION OP MARRIAGE BETWEEN A FEMALE WARD AND HER GUARDIAN
OR CURATOR, OR
His SON.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Marinus.
The authority of the Decree of the Senate, by which marriage between a female
ward and the son of her guardian is very properly forbidden, must not be evaded
under the pretext of ignorance and want of experience.
2. The Emperor Alexander to Byruus.
The mother of a female ward is not prohibited from contracting marriage with
the guardian of her daughter, or the son of her guardian.
3. The Same to Rogatianus.
As you allege that your father, at a time when you say that you were not under
his control, was appointed curator of the woman whom you married, after you had
had children by her, and as the marriage already solemnized cannot be vitiated
by a subsequent occurrence, you need have no apprehension that, under a just
interpretation of
the law, the children which you have will be considered not to have been
legitimately born. In order, however, that all doubt may be removed, your
father, as well as your wife, should insist that another curator be appointed
in his stead; for your wife will have the power to demand an account of his
administration from the person who was substituted for him.
4. The Emperor Philip to Higina.
There can be no doubt that a freedman who gave his female ward, the daughter of
his patron, in marriage to his natural son who was born in slavery and was
afterwards manumitted, is liable under the provisions of the Decree of the
Senate, which forbids marriages of this description.
5. The Emperor Philip, and the Csesar Philip, to Apuleius.
You have been falsely informed that a curator cannot marry his daughter to a
minor in his charge.
6. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus to Lucius.
If you married your father's female ward before the account of the guardianship
was rendered, or even after it was rendered, but before she attained her
twenty-fifth year, or before the available year expired, you cannot be
considered to have contracted marriage with her, or to have had a child by such
an union. Where, however, the father of the girl requested that the marriage
should take place at the time of his death, and this was done in accordance
with law, the child will be considered legitimate.
7. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Ctesars, to Paragonius.
If a guardian or a curator should, without having obtained an Imperial Rescript
for that purpose, marry his ward or a minor in his charge either to himself or
to his son, he shall be branded with infamy as having confessed that he had
been guilty of mismanagement of the guardianship, because, by an union of this
kind, he had attempted to conceal fraud committed during his administration;
and hence any dowry which was given can be recovered by a personal action.
8. The Emperors Leo and Anthemius to Erythrius, Prsetorian Prefect.
If anyone, having fraudulently assumed the name of guardian or curator, that is
to say has, without proper authority, administered the affairs of a female
minor in the capacity of her guardian, curator, or agent, and has either
married her himself, or given her in marriage to his son, We decree that a
matrimonial alliance of this kind shall stand, and not be annulled like that of
an actual guardian; in order that where children are born of marriages
contracted in this designing or malignant manner, or dowries have been given or
promised on account of them, they may not be subjected to injury or annoyance.
TITLE VII.
WHERE ANYONE CLOTHED WITH POWER, OR ANY OF His
SUBORDINATES, ATTEMPTS TO MARRY A FEMALE SUBJECT
TO His JURISDICTION.
1. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Theodore, Prsetorian
Prefect.
When any person invested with ordinary power, or other authority, makes use of
it for the purpose of contracting marriage, if the woman herself, or her
parents are unwilling (whether she is a ward, a virgin living with her father,
or a widow who is her own mistress, no matter what position she may occupy),
and he is convicted of either employing or of having employed threats against
the persons who are unwilling, for the purpose of accomplishing his design, We
decree that he shall be liable to a fine of ten pounds of gold for having made
such an attempt, even though he may not have effected a marriage forbidden by
law; and, as he has forfeited his honor, We prohibit him from availing himself
of the dignity which he has acquired, and as he has made such bad use of his
office, if he refuses to obey Our laws, he shall, by way of penalty, be
forbidden by the judge to live for the term of two years in the province in
which he so exceeded his authority.
It is also added that, if he still retains his office, the person whom he
attempted to take advantage of by conduct of this kind shall be permitted to
bring a complaint immediately, and, with her household, decline to submit to
the jurisdiction of the magistrate concerned; and the execution of this law
shall devolve upon the defenders of every city, and the subordinate officials
of the court. And, indeed, if an ordinary judge is accused of an offence of
this kind, all the affairs of his household, as well as all the civil and
criminal business, shall be brought before his deputy, as long as the said
judge remains in office. Where, however, his deputy, or anyone else invested
with similar authority, has undertaken to employ violence in the contraction of
a marriage of this kind, the ordinary judge, on the other hand, shall interpose
his authority. But where both of them are liable to suspicion, the protection
of such households shall be especially undertaken by the illustrious
prefecture, as long as the aforesaid magistrates remain in office.
Given at Thessalonica, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof May, during the
Consulate of Gratian, Consul for the second time, and Theodosius, 380.
TITLE Vill.
CONCERNING MARRIAGE DEMANDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OP A RESCRIPT.
1. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Theodore, Prsetorian Prefect.
Certain persons, in violation of the provisions of the ancient law, think that
they have a right to demand authority to contract a mar-
riage which they understand is forbidden, by means of a fraudulent request made
to Us; and they often pretend that they have obtained the consent of the girl.
For this reason We, by the present law, forbid all marriages of this
description. Hence, if anyone, by means of a fraudulent petition, obtains
permission to contract a marriage of this kind, contrary to the provisions of
this law, let him entertain no doubt that he will suffer the loss of his
property, and the penalty of deportation, and that the marriage which he has
made by such forbidden means having been annulled, he will not have any
legitimate children born of such an union, nor any pardon or indulgence, as the
rescript or-annotation will be considered void, except in those cases where the
marriage or the betrothal has been requested by the parents of the girl, or
where, in conformity with the provisions of the law, they demand that what has
been given as a betrothal pledge shall be returned, together with the
prescribed penalty.
Given on the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of Honorius, Consul for
the eighth time, and Theodosius, Consul for the third time, 409.
2. The Emperor Zeno to Basilius, Prsetorian Prefect.
We again absolutely forbid, under all circumstances, the abominable crime of
the marriage of an uncle and a niece, which has already been prohibited under
the severest penalties by the Imperial Constitutions. We also hereafter refuse
to all persons permission to ask for such a marriage (or rather for such a
contagion), in order that everyone may know that if he should fraudulently
obtain consent for what even the right of a petition is hereby denied, it will
be of no advantage to him.
TITLE IX. CONCERNING SECOND MARRIAGES.
1. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Eutro-pius, Prsetorian
Prefect.
Any woman, who hastens to contract a second marriage without having properly
mourned for her first husband, becomes infamous by the effect of a well-known
law; and besides, she cannot give to her second husband by way of dowry more
than a third part of the property, nor can she leave him by her will more than
a third of her estate.
Moreover, she will not be entitled to any inheritances, legacies, or trusts
left to her by a last will, or by a donation mortis causa,for We order that all
these things shall be claimed by the heirs, the co-heirs, or successors ab
intestatoof the deceased, lest We may not seem to have in view the benefit of
the Treasury while We are attempting to correct this violation of morality. She
shall also lose whatever her husband left her by his last will, even though the
property bequeathed to her by her first husband may be without an owner, on
account of her premature marriage; and in the first place, We decree that it
shall descend to the ten persons enumerated in the Edict of the Praetor, that
is to say, to the ascendants and descendants, and next in the collateral line
as far as the second degree (the regular order of degrees being, of course,
observed), and then it shall be acquired by the Treasury. Again, We do not
permit such a woman, who has become infamous, to claim any estate on the ground
of intestacy, either by the civil or praetorian law, beyond the third degree.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Gratian and Theodosius, 380.
Extract from Novel 22, Chapter XL; and Novel 34, Chapter II. Latin Text.
A woman who brings forth a child within the time prescribed for mourning shall
be liable to the same penalty, provided there is no doubt that the said
offspring does not belong to the deceased, for she should also be deprived of
the usufruct of the ante-nuptial donation.
The same rule applies to a woman who, having accepted the guardianship of her
children, marries a second time, in violation of her oath, without having
previously applied for a guardian, rendered an account, and paid everything
that she owed. At present, however, by a subsequent law, the oath is not
exacted of her, but if she contracts a second marriage, she will be deprived of
the guardianship.
2. The Same to Eutropius, Praetorian Prefect.
Where a woman who has lost her husband hastens to marry another within the term
of a year (for We have added a short time to be observed after the ten months
formerly prescribed, although We think that the entire period is extremely
brief), she shall be branded with opprobrium, and be deprived of the rights and
honors due to persons of noble and distinguished rank, and shall lose
everything which she acquired from the estate of her first husband, either at
the time of betrothal, or by the last will of the deceased.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Kalendsof June, during the
Consulate of Eucherius and Syagrius, 381.
3. The Same to Theodore, Prtetorian Prefect.
Women who have had children by their first husbands, and marry a second time
after the prescribed term of mourning has elapsed, transmit intact to their
children all the property which they have received from their former husbands,
whether they obtained anything by marriage, by donations mortis causa,directly
by will, under a trust, by virtue of a legacy, or through any other evidence of
liberality from the estates of their first husbands (as has been previously
stated), and they can transmit it to any one of their children (provided the
latter is one of those whom We have decided to be entitled to such a
succession), and whom the mother may, in consideration of its merits, consider
worthy of her bounty.
Such women shall not presume to alienate property of this description to any
stranger, or to a child born of the second marriage, and they shall have only
the right of the possession and enjoyment of such
property during their lives, but the authority to alienate it is not granted
them. For, if any of such property should be transferred by a woman of this
kind to any person whomsoever, it shall be restored out of her own estate, in
order that it may come unimpaired and intact into the hands of those children
who We have decided are entitled to it.
(1) We also add to this law, that if any of the children who are proved to have
been born of the former marriage should die after the mother has disgraced
herself by a second one, all the surviving offspring of the same marriage shall
have a right to whatever the mother would be considered entitled to ab
intestato,or under the will of her child by the same succession; and she shall
only have possession of the share due to her for the term of her life, and must
leave everything to the surviving children of the former marriage; nor shall
she have power to bequeath property of this kind to any stranger whomsoever, or
to alienate any of the same.
If she should not have had issue by her first marriage, or her child or
children should die, she is hereby fully authorized to dispose of everything
which she has acquired in any way, and shall be legally entitled to complete
ownership of the same, and can leave it by will to anyone whom she may select.

A woman who has hastened to contract a second marriage succeeds to her
children under the terms of their wills, just as any other person who was
appointed heir. She also is called to an intestate succession, whether she
married the second time before the death of her child, or afterwards. In case
of an intestate succession, however, she will only receive the usufruct of such
property as came into the hands of the child from his father's estate. The same
rule applies to antenuptial donations, as to other property, but the
ingratitude of the mother and the brothers should, in this instance also, by
all means be taken into consideration.
Extract from Novel 2, Chapter II; and Novel 22, Chapter XXVI. Latin Text.
If, however, any one of them should die first without issue, the ownership of a
part of the property left will go to the mother, in
accordance with the agreement made in case there should be no children, and the
remainder will pass to the heirs of the deceased, whoever they may be;
therefore, if she should dispose of any of said property, the sale will be
valid so far as the portion above mentioned is concerned. But when the mother
is the only heir, she herself will be entitled to the entire estate, and she
can follow any alienation of it that she pleases.
4. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Marinus, Prsetorian Prefect.
While We have previously ordered by other laws that the estate of the mother
shall descend intact to the children, still, where she has acquired any
property through the generosity of her husband, the children born of the first
marriage are informed that they have a right to make a special claim to it, as
constituting part of their father's estate. Therefore, if a woman who had
children should contract a second marriage, only the issue of said second
marriage shall have a right to the possession of all the property which the
second husband gave to his wife at the time of their betrothal; and it will be
of no advantage to those by the former marriage that the woman did not marry a
third time.
If, however, the second husband should die without leaving any children,
whatever his wife obtained from him as a betrothal gift shall belong to her by
law, even if the donor is shown to have left children by a former marriage. So
far as the estate of the mother is concerned, any offspring which she may
leave, no matter from what husband the property was obtained, or whether it was
derived from this or from some other source, shall have the share to which they
are entitled from their mother's estate, whether it became theirs by gift, or
under the terms of a will. For We decree that it is expressly provided by this
law, that children, no matter of what marriage they are born, shall be entitled
to any property donated by their father at the time of his betrothal.
Given at Ravenna, on the third of the Nonesof November, during the Consulate of
Honorius, Consul for the thirteenth time, and Theodosius, Consul for the tenth
time, 422.
5. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Florentius, Prsetorian Prefect.
Generally speaking, We decree that, in every instance where, before the
promulgation of this law, the constitutions direct that a woman shall preserve
for the benefit of their common children all the property which came into her
hands from the estate of her husband where the marraige was dissolved by death
this shall be done; and also, under the same circumstances, that the husband
shall preserve for the common children everything which came into his hands
from the estate of his wife, where the marriage was terminated by the death of
the latter. It makes no difference whether someone else made an ante-nuptial
donation for the benefit of the husband, or gave a dowry for the benefit of the
wife.
We order that this rule shall be observed, even though the property included in
the ante-nuptial donation (as is usually the case), was given by the wife by
way of dowry. We decree, moreover, that the ownership of the property preserved
for the children by the provisions of this law, or by those of former
constitutions, shall belong to them. Therefore, where the person who was
keeping the said property for the children dies, all surviving children shall
have a right to recover it from any possessor whomsoever, and if it has been
consumed, can exact its value from the heirs of him who had the right to
preserve it. The right to alienate or encumber property which should be
preserved, or which has been ordered to be kept for their benefit, is not
permitted. We, however, grant to the father the right to administer the
business of his children in a proper manner; nor do We deny to the parents
permission to divide their property between their children according to their
own judgment, or even to select any one of them whom they may prefer.
(1) Still, in those instances in which the mother is directed to preserve the
property for the common children, because it belonged to their father, that is
to say, where the marriage has been dissolved by the death of the husband, and
the woman marries a second time; or where We order that the father shall
preserve the property of the mother for the benefit of their common offspring,
when the marriage has been dissolved by the death of the wife, and the husband
marries again; if the children should not enter upon the estate of their
father, who died first, they shall only be permitted to claim for themselves
the property of the parent who died last; that is, if they should decide to
accept the estate of the one who died last, in order that what was established
for the benefit of the said children may not, in certain cases, appear to have
been devised for their injury.
Extract from Novel 23, Chapter XXIII, XVI. Latin Text.
Any profit obtained during marriage belongs to the children, although they may
not be heirs of their father or mother, or of both of them; unless they have
been ungrateful, and their ingratitude is
proved.

(2) We have thought that, for the sake of humanity, the following should be
inserted in this law, that is to say, in every instance in which profit is
obtained, where property comes into the hands of the wife from the husband, or
the husband obtains anything from the estate of his wife when the first
marriage is dissolved by the death of one of the parties, and the survivor does
not marry again; and if the husband of the wife, that is to say, the survivor,
does not consume or alienate the property (which there is no doubt belongs to
them as owners when they do not contract a second marriage), the children are
entitled to the property which formed part of their father's estate, as well as
to that derived from the estate of their mother.
Extract from Novel 98, Chapter I. Latin Text.
When the wife dies, the profits that the husband obtained from the dowry, the
usufruct of which is granted to him, are absolutely reserved for the common
children, so far as their ownership is concerned.
The same rule applies to the share of the woman, if she has profited to any
extent by the betrothal gift. Likewise, where the marriage is dissolved in any
other manner, these profits are disposed of by the same constitution.
Extract from Novel 127, Chapter III. Latin Text.
If, however, the mother should not marry a second time, she herself will be
entitled to a share of the property, in proportion to the number of her
children. This rule also applies to the father and all relatives in the
ascending line, who do not contract a second marriage.
6. The Emperors Leo and Anthemius to Erythrius, Prsetorian Prefect.
We order by this published law, which shall be valid for all time, that where
there are any children by a former marriage, and either the father or the
mother contracts matrimonial vows a second or a third time, or more, it shall
not be permitted to leave to the stepmother or stepfather, either by a will
written or unwritten, or by a codicil, or by the right of inheritance, or by
virtue of a legacy or a trust, or by way of dowry or ante-nuptial donations, or
by a donation mortis causaor one inter vivos(although these last donations are
forbidden by the Civil Law to be made during marriage, still they are, for
certain reasons, usually confirmed, after the death of the donor), more than
they could have left or given to a son or daughter, if either one of them were
living. Where, however, there are several children, they will all be entitled
to equal shares, and no more can be acquired by any one of them than is
permitted to be given to their stepfather or their stepmother. When, however,
the above-mentioned property was not transmitted in equal shares to the said
children, then it shall not be lawful to leave to the stepmother or stepfather
by will, or to donate by way of dowry or as an ante-nuptial donation, any more
than a son or a daughter would be entitled to, to whom a smaller share of the
estate was left or given by the last will of the testator; provided, that the
fourth part due to the said children under the law cannot, in any way, be
diminished, unless for those reasons which prevent the complaint of
inofficiousness.
We decree that this rule shall also apply to the grandfather or the
grandmother, the great-grandfather, and the great-grandmother, as well as to
the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of both sexes; in either the paternal
or maternal line of descent whether they are under paternal control, or have
been emancipated or not.
If, however, any property in excess of what has been prescribed by law should
be left to the stepmother or the stepfather, or donated or presented to either
of them, the surplus shall be considered as not having been referred to, left,
donated, or given; and We order that it shall belong to the children, and be
divided among them; for the
purpose of avoiding every evasion of the law which may be attempted, either by
the interposition of a third person, or in any other manner whatsoever.
(1) We add to these provisions that a woman, in those instances in which ante-
nuptial donations or other property has come to her from her husband, shall be
compelled to preserve the same for their common children, as constituting part
of their father's estate, in accordance with the terms of former laws; that is
to say, when, after the marriage has been dissolved by the death of the
husband, she contracts another, she can only enjoy the usufruct of the movable
property and the slaves, as well as the civil allowance of support, during her
lifetime; all alienation of the same being absolutely prohibited. With
reference to the movable property, however, she shall, in like manner, be
entitled to its usufruct, after a just appraisement has been made by arbiters
chosen with the consent of all parties, and after an oath has been administered
; provided she furnishes good security that she will restore the said property
or the value of the same to the sons or daughters who are the issue of this
marriage; or, after their death, to all her grandsons and granddaughters
descended from the said children, or to any one of them who may happen to
survive; and that she will do this in accordance with the laws. But if she
should fail, or be unwilling to furnish proper security, the aforesaid property
shall remain in the hands of the children, if it has not yet been transferred
by them to their mother; and where it has been delivered to her, or is retained
by her, it shall be returned to the children. If proper security is offered by
them to their mother, by which it is agreed to pay her annually three per cent
on the estimated value of said property, instead of the usufruct or the sum at
which it was appraised; the children must not fail at any time to make said
payments.
It should also be provided by the bond that (if all the said children or their
descendants should happen to die before their mother) the above-mentioned
movable property shall be restored to her in accordance with the distribution
prescribed by law in order that she may have the benefit of the profit derived
from misfortune. Hence, if anyone of those who has furnished security should
consider it advantageous for himself, he shall be permitted to use and enjoy
the said movable property, and either to lend, encumber, or sell the same; in
order that the children may, by means of what is acquired by them, be enabled
to provide for their mother, without suffering any inconvenience themselves.
But if either of them should neglect, or be unable to furnish the security
aforesaid, the property shall remain in the hands of the woman during her
lifetime.

If a quantity of gold was mentioned in the donation made in consideration of
marriage, the contract must state that the interest on the same shall be paid,
but the gold itself cannot be exacted, unless it, as well as the other property
mentioned in the donation, was included in the estate of the husband.

(2) All the property which the woman received from her husband, as well as what
she herself has, or will be entitled to, is encumbered to the children who were
the issue of her first marriage, just as if it had been pledged or hypothecated
to guarantee the ante-nuptial donation or any other property which may have
come into her hands as part of the estate of her husband, from the very day
when she obtained possession of the same; so that if anyone should make a
contract with the woman after the said property was delivered to, or retained
by her, and she marries a second time, there is no doubt that, when it is
claimed, the children born of the first marriage, and any grandsons or
granddaughters descended from them, will be preferred to those born of the
second marriage.
(3) When, however, retaining parental affection for their children, either the
father or the mother is unwilling to contract a second marriage, the husband
shall not be prohibited from using according to his wishes, or selling, or
alienating in any way whatsoever, or pledging or hypothecating (if he or she
should wish to do so) as owner of the same, any property which belonged to the
estate of his wife, or the latter what belonged to that of her husband, and
which may have come into the possession of either.
The children shall be permitted to recover any of said property, if it has not
been alienated, consumed, or pledged; even though they may not have accepted
the estates of their parents.

7. The Emperor Zeno to Sebastian, Prsetorian Prefect.
In some cases, the father, in others, the mother, is required to preserve an
ante-nuptial donation, or property which is derived from some other source for
the children of both sexes. If one of the sons or daughters should happen to
predecease the father or the mother (either before one of them has contracted a
second marriage, or afterwards) and leaves a son or a daughter, a grandson or a
granddaughter, or several of them, during the lifetime of his or her father or
mother, We decree that the share to which the deceased son or daughter was
entitled, or any profit derived therefrom, shall not pass to the brothers or
sisters of the deceased, but to their sons and daughters, or grandchildren of
both sexes; or to their great-grandchildren; or to their grandparents or great-
grandparents, if they are living; and that they shall not be prevented from
selecting such of their surviving children as they may desire to favor.
Given on the Kalendsof March, during the fifth Consulate of Ellus, 478.
8. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Prxtorian Prefect.
If any of the children by a former marriage should die before the father or the
mother marries again, leaving either children, grandchildren, or great-
grandchildren, We decree that the share of the deceased
shall not go to his brothers or sisters, or, if he should have none, to his
father or mother, but to his own children, grandchildren, and great-
grandchildren, and, whether there be one or more, they can only claim the share
of the estate to which the defunct was entitled.
(1) We have determined to prescribe by a positive law that, where anyone having
children by a first marriage does not marry a second time, either of his
parents shall, in the same manner, be permitted to alienate or administer
property obtained by the former marriage in any way that he or she may desire.
If, however, none of this property has been alienated, the children shall have
a right to claim it, even if they do not accept the estate of their father or
mother.,
(2) We order that any alienation of property of this kind, which has been made
by the will of either the father or mother, or which has been either generally
or specially bequeathed at the time of the appointment of the heir, shall be
considered valid.

(3) Permission is granted to children to claim any profits derived from the
marriage, even if they do not enter upon the estate of their father or mother,
where neither of their said parents contracted a second marriage, and did not
alienate the property acquired by them; but We by no means permit them to
demand for themselves any such property, if they have acquired any part of
their father's or mother's estates, when the deceased parent has any other
children by a former marriage.
(4) In order to confirm the ancient law We order, as in the case of a mother
whose property, after a second marriage, is held to be hypothecated to the
children by the first one, for the purpose of preserving the profits to which
they are entitled, that also the property of the father, which he either has,
or may hereafter acquire, and which, after a second marriage, must be preserved
by him for the benefit of children by a former one, if he obtained it from
their mother, shall also be considered as hypothecated.
We decree that the property of the said father, who has one or more children of
this kind under his control, shall be encumbered to that of the mother for the
benefit of the said children, and that its preservation shall be compulsory if
it comes to them from the maternal line of descent; nevertheless, the children
must not scrutinize the administration of their father or their mother too
closely, under the pretext of such an hypothecation; nor should they seek to
raise any question on this point, as it is a clear rule of law that if any
property not included in that above mentioned, or which forms part of their
mother's estate, should be alienated, the right of hypothecation will remain
unimpaired, so far as the said children are concerned.

Justinian, Consul for the second time, 528.
9. The Same to Menna, Praetorian Prefect.
As laws previously enacted have settled that everything which a wife or a
husband, having children by a former marriage, has given or bequeathed after a
second one, either by way of donation or in any other manner, to a larger
amount than should be donated or left to a single son or daughter, the issue of
a former marriage, should be revoked for the benefit of the sons and daughters
alone who are the children by the said former marriage; and, as in this
Section, no reference was made to children who are the issue of the second
marriage, We, for the purpose of correcting this omission, do hereby decree
that everything which is revoked, as aforesaid, shall not only go to the
children of the first marriage, but also to those who are the issue of the
second, and shall be equally distributed among all of them.
(1) In addition to this, We direct that any profits obtained by either the wife
or the husband through a dowry or an ante-nuptial donation, shall be subject to
the same rule, in case of repudiation, and after the second marriage of either
of the parties, shall be preserved indiscriminately for the benefit of the
children who are the issue of the former marriage, just as in the case of
divorce or death; nor can any attempt be made to call the divorce in question,
or to institute any other inquiry concerning the matter.

Children by a first marriage are now alone entitled to this benefit, and if any
one of them should die, leaving issue, his share shall pass to them.
10. The Same to Demosthenes, Prsetorian Prefect.
It has been clearly provided by law that ungrateful children should with reason
be excluded from the inheritances of their ancestors, where the latter have
mentioned this in their wills, and it has actually been shown that the Divine
Constitution of the Emperor Leo, of illustrious memory, which was promulgated
with reference to children who were the issue of a former marriage, seems to
contradict a provision of this kind. For, as either the father or mother, who
contracted a second marriage, is required, for any reason whatsoever, to give
to the second husband, or stepmother, only as much as he or she could leave to
that son or daughter, the issue of the former marriage, who was entitled to the
smallest share of the estate, the greatest injustice to parents was caused by
this law; for, in every instance, children, being aware that their parents
could, even against their will, be prevented from leaving them only as much as
the second
husband or the stepmother was entitled to receive, injured their parents by all
kinds of dissipation and excesses. Therefore, We decree that any children who
are actually ungrateful shall not hereafter have any right to enjoy the benefit
conferred upon them by the Divine Constitution of the August Leo, but shall be
excluded as unworthy from every privilege of this description.
We also decree that this provision shall be observed with reference to
grandfathers and grandmothers, great-grandfathers and great-grandmothers,
grandsons and granddaughters, as well as great-grandsons and great-
granddaughters, whether they are under paternal control, or have been
emancipated, and whether they are in the paternal or maternal line of descent.
But as We provide for the protection of the parents, so also, We do not suffer
their innocent posterity to be subjected to injury, nor permit their parents,
who have contracted a second marriage, and perhaps may entertain an
unreasonable hatred of their children, to stigmatize them as ungrateful,
without good reason. Hence We desire that children shall be excluded from this
privilege who, through the efforts of the heirs of their parents, have been
convicted by clear and undoubted evidence of being ungrateful toward the
latter, in those instances which have been enumerated in former laws.

TITLE X.
WHERE A WOMAN, TO WHOM HER HUSBAND LEFT AN USUFRUCT, MARRIES A SECOND TIME.
1. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Tatian, Prsetorian
Prefect.
When a husband, at his death, leaves his wife the usufruct of his property, and
she contracts a second marriage, she shall lose the usufruct which she obtained
from her first husband, and must surrender it to her children by him, from the
day on which she married a second time. If, however, the children by the first
marriage should still be in the weakness of infancy, and she does not give them
the assistance of a guardian, but seizes an opportunity of this kind to
appropriate the property which was left to them, all of it can be recovered by
law, and she must surrender it with its profits, after having deducted the
necessary expenses.
This applies to the usufruct which a man, when making his last will, bequeathed
out of his own property for the benefit of his wife. We, however, decree that
where the usufruct of ante-nuptial donations is concerned, the rules
established by previous constitutions shall be
observed.
Given on the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Arcadius, Consul for the
second time, and Rufinus, 392.
Extract from Novel 22, Chapter XXXII. Latin Text.
This law applies where the usufruct is given or left under the condition that
it shall be extinguished in case of a second marriage; otherwise, it will
remain in full force, provided it has been left or donated under circumstances
which render it legal. An usufruct given as a dowry or an ante-nuptial
donation, which is authorized by law, cannot be revoked by a testator.
TITLE XI.
CONCERNING THE PROMISE OP A DOWRY, AND ONE MADE WITHOUT CONSIDERATION.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Claudius.
You are wrong in your opinion that you are entitled to an action to recover a
dowry which has been promised, but not delivered to you, as no specific
property or sum was agreed upon, and it was only stated in the nuptial contract
that the woman who was married promised to give a dowry.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Herodotus, Prsetorian Prefect.
If your father-in-law contracted to pay interest on the dowry which he promised
you, a competent judge will order you to be given what you prove is due to you.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of Pius
and Pontianus, 239.
3. The Same to Claudius.
If the person whom you mentioned promised legally to give you a dowry for the
woman who marries you, without mentioning the amount, but stating that it would
be whatever he himself might decide upon, and he does not comply with the terms
of the stipulation, you, having availed yourself of the proper action, can
obtain by a judgment what was promised you, for it is considered that a sum
which would be approved by a good citizen was included in the stipulation.
Given on the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of Sabinus and Venustus,
241.
4. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Cassars, to Rufus.
If you stated in the dotal contract with the consent of the person who gave the
dowry that more was given than you received, you are informed that you can, in
accordance with the agreement, recover whatever is lacking.
Given on the Nonesof April, during the above-mentioned Consulate.
5. The Same Emperors and Cassars to Desumiana.
If your father promised a dowry to your husband who entered into the
stipulation, an action to recover it will not lie in your favor, but in favor
of your husband, against the heirs of his father-in-law.
6. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Hierius, Prsetorian Prefect.
We decree that any words whatsoever will be sufficient for the exaction of a
dowry after it has once been agreed to be given, whether they have been reduced
to writing or not; and even if the stipulation did not follow the promise of
the dotal property.
Given on the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Felix and Taurus, 428.
7. The Emperor Justinian to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
If a father should simply give a dowry to his daughter, or should make an ante-
nuptial donation for his son, the latter, whether he is under the control of
his father or has been emancipated, will be entitled to the estate of his
mother, or any property obtained in some other way, of which he cannot now
obtain the acquisition, and the usufruct of which solely remains with his
father, or of actions of any description which he has the right to bring
against his father.
A -doubt arose among the ancient authorities whether the father released
himself from liability from this obligation, when he promised or gave the dowry
or the ante-nuptial donation, or whether the obligation would continue to
retain its character and paternal liberality suggest the payment of the said
dowry or ante-nuptial donation. In a doubtful matter of this kind, a division
of opinion existed between the greater number of jurists, and the difficulty
was increased by the addition of the question (in case the father had stated in
the dotal contract that the dowry or ante-nuptial donation was bestowed out of
the property of both father and mother) whether the gift or promise should be
considered to have been made in proportion to half of his entire estate, or pro
rata,in accordance with the value of the estate
of each.
Therefore, for the purpose of positively putting an end to both of these
ambiguous points, We decree that if the father had thought that nothing further
should be added, but simply gave the dowry or the ante-nuptial donation, or
made a promise to do so, he must be understood to have done this induced by his
own generosity, and that what was due should retain its proper character; for
these laws are well known by which it has been provided that it is, by all
means, the duty of the father to give a dowry or an ante-nuptial donation for
the benefit of his offspring. Hence, an act of liberality of this kind shall
remain valid and irrevocable, and it, with the obligation, will enure
to their benefit.
Where, however, a father declares that he grants liberalities of this kind out
of his own property, or out of that of the mother, or of other persons which
cannot be acquired, or out of what he himself owes, then, if he is in absolute
want, the dowry or the ante-nuptial donation must be considered to have been
given out of the property belonging to his sons or his daughters. But if he
himself possesses considerable property, in this instance he will be understood
to have bestowed the dowry or the ante-nuptial donation out of his own estate;
for he would have been able to have given a dowry for his daughter or an ante-
nuptial donation for his son, in proportion to his means, and to have consented
that his children, if they desired to do so, might add a part, or even all of
that to which they were entitled through the generosity of their father in
giving the dowry or the ante-nuptial donation; so that it will actually be
apparent not only what he himself intended to give, but also what was derived
from the property of his children, and he would not be compelled to rely upon
vain statements, and thereby incur serious risk.
Given on the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of Lam-padius and
Orestes, 530.
TITLE XII. CONCERNING THE LAW OF DOWRIES.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Nicephorus.
If property given as dowry is evicted, and an agreement or a promise has been
interposed, the son-in-law can bring a personal action, or one based on the
stipulation, against his father-in-law, his wife, or their heirs. When,
however, no agreement or promise was made, an action on purchase will lie after
the eviction, if an appraisement of the property was made. But where this was
not done, and the property was given in good faith by way of dowry, no action
will lie in favor of the husband. If, however, fraud for which the donor was
responsible existed, an action on the ground of fraud can be brought against
you, provided no fraud was committed by the woman; for then he will be entitled
to an action in factumto avoid one involving infamy being granted against her.
Given on the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Mutian and Favian, 202.
2. The Emperor Antoninus to Alluvias.
Where a stipulation was made with reference to the return of a part of the
dowry given, and the condition upon which this depended is fulfilled, he in
whose favor the agreement was planned and entered into will be entitled to an
action. In accordance with this, if your sister Polla is entitled to an action
for the recovery of half of the dowry because your mother, with the intention
of making a donation, permitted her daughter to stipulate for the return of
half of the dowry after her death, she need not apprehend an exception on the
ground of fraud, for the reason that she is the heir to less than half of the
estate of her mother, who made the agreement; unless it should be clearly
proved that the latter changed her mind with reference to the agreement for the
dowry, and desired that her daughter should be content with the preferred
legacy instead of her hereditary share of the estate, and intended that her
husband should be released from the necessity of making restitution.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Antoninus,
Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
3. The Emperor Alexander to Euphemius.
Although the father has a right to demand restoration of the dowry when his
daughter dies during marriage, still, where the husband has by will legally
conferred freedom, both directly and under a trust, upon the dotal slaves, his
father cannot revoke it after it has once been granted, as the husband has free
power during marriage to manumit dotal slaves inter vivos.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof December, during the Consulate of Antoninus
and Alexander, 223.
4. The Same to Valens.
It is not prohibited by any laws for a woman to give all the property to her
husband by way of dowry.
Given on the fourth of the Idesof July, during the Consulate of Maximus, Consul
for the second time, and JElianus, 224.
5. The Same to Statia.
Whenever the property given as dowry is appraised, the husband obtains the
ownership of the same, but he becomes, as it were, the debtor for its value.
Therefore, if no agreement is made that the property shall be restored in case
the marriage is dissolved, and it has been legally appraised, he can retain it
if he tenders you the
money.
Given on the third of the Idesof April, during the Consulate of Alexander,
Consul for the second time, and Marcellus, 227.
6. The Emperor Maximian to Sulpitius.
If you have become the heir of your grandmother, she can transmit to you the
right of action based on the agreement for the recovery of the property which
she gave as dowry for your daughter, even though a verbal obligation may not
have been assumed. For the rule is not the same where the father or mother
makes a contract of this kind, as that of the mother gives a right to the Actio
prsescriptis verbis,and that that of the father is, by no means, considered to
change by a simple agreement the right .of action founded on the profectitial
dowry.
Given on the third of the Idesof February, during the Consulate of Maximian and
Africanus, 237.
7. The Emperor Gordian to Marcus.
Where a dowry is given by your father-in-law to you for the benefit of your
wife, and a stipulation is not added to it at the time when it is given, or
afterwards, your father-in-law, in making an agreement with you against the
consent of his daughter, cannot injure his own legal position; for when she
alone institutes proceedings with reference to the dowry, it is forbidden by
law for the agreement to operate to his disadvantage.
Given on the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of Pius and Pontianus,
239.
8. The Same to Agrippina.
Even if the mother does not actually stipulate that the dowry shall be returned
to her, but that what she gave by way of dowry shall follow her, or belong to
her, in case her daughter should die during marriage, and the daughter does
die, We decree that it is perfectly just that the mother shall be held to have
acquired a right of action under the stipulation. The result of this is that
even property given as an addition to the dowry can be recovered by the same
action.
Given on the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of Sabinus and Venustus,
241.
9. The Emperor Decius, and the Csesar, to Urbicana.
Your claim for your dowry is preferable to that of the State to which your
husband subsequently became indebted.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof June, during the Consulate of Decius and
Gratus, 251.
10. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Ingenuus.
As you allege that the dowry which you received was appraised, it is apparent,
according to the Common Law, that under the agreement inserted in the dotal
contract, an action on purchase will lie, for who can doubt that the value of
the dowry is due from you to your wife; and that the property of which it is
composed will become deteriorated at your risk; or that its increase will enure
to your benefit?
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and Acquilinus, 286.
11. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Severa.
There is no doubt that your husband will have a right of action with reference
to the property which you allege was given by way of dowry and subsequently
removed.
Given at Heraclea, on the tenth of the Kalendsof May, during the above-
mentioned Consulate.
12. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Rufina.
The land purchased by your husband with money forming part of the dowry is not
acquired by you, for a husband cannot acquire for his wife a right of action on
purchase, and only an action on dowry will lie in your favor. Therefore, if the
Governor of the province, after having been applied to, should find that you
have not made a compromise, but have obtained the larger part of the dowry, he
will provide for the return of the remainder.
Given at Heraclea, on the eighth of the Kalends ofMay, during the above-
mentioned Consulate.
13. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Catula and Statia.If any property
belonging to you has been given by your mother to your stepfather by way of
dowry, and he is aware that it is yours,
you are informed that such a gift has no validity in law, when no promise or
stipulation was made.
Given at Heraclea, on the day before the Kalendsof May, under the above-
mentioned Consulate.
14. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Basilissa.
A mother cannot be compelled to give a dowry for her daughter, unless some good
and sufficient cause exists for doing so, or she is expressly required to do so
by law, nor has a father any power to bestow a dowry out of the property of his
wife against her consent.
Given at Philippopolis, on the Nonesof November, during the above-mentioned
Consulate.
15. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Ulpian.
Where it is proved by other evidence that a dowry was given without the
execution of dotal instruments, it is established that, after a divorce has
taken place, the dowry of your former wife should be restored to her in
accordance with good faith, for if the documents are lost, any other legal
proofs which may be introduced will undoubtedly not be considered void.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof August, during the abovementioned
Consulate.
16. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Mmilius.
Your sister having succeeded to your father, who died intestate, is not
prohibited from giving, as her dowry, her undivided share of a tract of land,
before a division of the estate has been made.
Given on the Nonesof July, during the Consulate of the Csesars.
17. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Sabinus.
Your mother-in-law, by selling the usufruct which he had reserved for herself
out of the property that she gave you by way of dowry, can not deprive you of
the same.
Given on the Nonesof July, during the Consulate of the Csesars.
18. The Same to Menestratus. _If your mother-in-law conveyed a tract of land to
your wife with the reservation of the usufruct, and your wife gave the said
property to you by way of dowry, and then your mother-in-law transferred to you
the usufruct of the same, and if your wife should die during marriage, there is
no doubt that the land will remain in your hands in accordance with the terms
of the agreement entered into between you. If, however, your mother-in-law gave
her daughter the usufruct in consideration of receiving a certain sum of money
annually, and the latter should die, the usufruct will by no means be
extinguished.
Given on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
19. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Achilles.As you state that your father-in-
law, when giving you a dowry for his daughter, made an agreement to the effect
that if, after his own
death, his daughter should die during marriage, half of the said dowry should
be given to Amnia; and, after having made his will, and appointed Amnia his
heir, along with others, he directed that Amnia should not claim or agree to
anything under the stipulation, no action based on a contract made with another
will lie in her favor, unless it is proved that Amnia stipulated under the
terms of the agreement that the property should be returned to her.
If, however, by the interpretation of the contract, Amnia should have acquired
an obligation for herself, and, after the fulfillment of the condition, she
demands that the stipulation be carried out, and it is shown that the testator
had your interests in view, you can avail yourself of an exception against her,
on the ground that, after the deduction of the Falcidian portion, she has
received all that was agreed upon, according to the intention of the deceased.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
20. The Same Emperors and Cassars to Tiberia.
It is a perfectly clear rule of law that the husband, on account of the burdens
imposed by marriage, is entitled to the enjoyment of the income of the entire
dowry which he has obtained; and that if he should permit his wife to have it,
as a donation, he can bring suit for the amount to which she has been
pecuniarily benefited for this reason.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of the Caesars.
21. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Geminius.
If an agreement has been made between husband and wife that, if their marriage
should be dissolved in any way within the term of five years, the property
constituting the dowry, which was appraised, shall be returned in the same
condition and at the same value as the amount of the appraisement, it is clear
that the value of the property should not be paid, but that the very thing
itself must be returned; as, in agreements for its restoration, the value was
only mentioned to prevent the property from being diminished or destroyed, and
it should not be demanded at any other valuation than that at which it was
estimated.
Given at Agrippina on the Nonesof August, during the Consulate of the Csesars.
22. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Libyana.
Ason-in-law cannot alienate property given by his father-in-law as dowry for
his daughter.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the same
Cassars.
23. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Diogenes.If your wife should sell land
forming part of her dowry, it makes no difference whether she did so
voluntarily or ratified the contract
after it was made; for she cannot deprive you of the ownership of the same
against your consent.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate
of the Caesars.
24. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Aurelius and Lysimachus.
If you gave a dowry to the husband of your freedwoman, and did not provide by
an agreement or stipulation that it should be immediately returned to you, in
case the marriage was dissolved, it is established that if it should be
dissolved through the fault of the wife, the dowry will remain in the hands of
the husband, even if you can show that she has been guilty of ingratitude
towards you.
Given at Antioch, on the sixth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate
of the Csesars.
25. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Eutychianus.
Where a woman stipulates that the dowry shall be given her by her husband in
order that she may leave it by will, as, in this instance, the thought of death
precedes the time of the execution of the will, it does not contain a condition
but a consideration, and hence, if the woman should die intestate, it is proper
for the stipulation to take
effect.
Given at Antioch, on the third of the Idesof November, during
the Consulate of the Csesars.
26. The Same Emperors and Cassars to Demosthenes.
If your father at the time he gave a dowry to his son-in-law stipulated for his
daughter that it should be transferred to you, who were emancipated, he will
acquire a right of action for you, if he does not change his mind, and the law
does not forbid you to receive the
dowry.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the same
Csesars.
27. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Pompeianus.
Although the dowry may lawfully remain in the hands of the husband, the heirs
of the estate of the wife, and not the former husband, are liable for public
contributions due from the estate.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
28. The Emperor Zeno to Mlianus, Prsstorian Prefect.
A woman, who is a minor, can legally give to, or demand from her husband a
dowry, with the general or special consent of her curator ; although he
himself, at the time of the constitution of the dowry, may have furnished a
surety for a sum less than the dowry is said
to amount to.
This rule shall also be observed where a minor has made an antenuptial donation
with the consent of his curator, as previously stated.
Given on the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of Basilius, Consul for
the second time, and Armatius, 476.
29. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Praetorian Prefect.
Where the husband has been reduced to poverty during the marriage, and his wife
desires to provide for herself, and to hold the property encumbered to her as
dowry, as well as any given to her by an ante-nuptial donation, in addition to
the dowry, We grant her the benefit of an exception for the purpose of
disposing of the hypothecation in favor of a second creditor, not only if she
holds the property of her husband, and is brought into court on this account,
but also if she herself institutes proceedings with reference to the same
property which has been hypothecated to her, in accordance with the provision
of the law against persons who have in their possession property belonging to a
husband, and We decree that the existence of the marriage cannot be pleaded
against her, but that she can recover the said property from subsequent
creditors, or from other parties who are not recognized by the law as having a
better claim to it; and this she can do just as if the marriage had been
dissolved, and she was thereby enabled to recover the dowry or ante-nuptial
donation; provided, however, that the same woman shall not have the power to
alienate the property during the lifetime of her husband, and while the
marriage between them is still in existence.
She, however, will be entitled to use the income of said property for the
maintenance of herself and her husband, as well as for that of her children, if
she has any. The creditors of the husband will undoubtedly retain their rights
unimpaired against him and any property which he may subsequently acquire, and
the husband and wife themselves, if the marriage should be dissolved, also
shall enjoy their rights so far as any dowry or ante-nuptial donation given in
accordance with the terms of the dotal agreement is concerned.
Given on the third of the Idesof December, during the Consulate of Our Lord
Justinian, Consul for the second time, 528.
Extract from Novel 97, Chapter VI. Latin Text.
In a case of this kind, a donation made in consideration of matrimony can be
recovered during the continuance of the marriage.
30. The Same to Demosthenes, Prsetorian Prefect.
With reference to dotal property, whether it is movable or immovable, or
capable of moving itself (if it is still in existence) and whether it has been
appraised or not, We order that a wife shall have a perfect right to recover
it, after the marriage has been dissolved, and that no creditor of the husband,
even though he may be first in point of time, shall be able to claim preference
for himself through the hypothecation of said property, as it in the first
place belonged to the wife, and naturally remains subject to her ownership; for
the truth of the matter is not destroyed or confused by the subtlety of the law
which presumes that it has become a part of the estate of the husband.
Therefore, We desire that she shall be entitled to the action in remrelating to
property of this kind, as being her own, and can, in preference to all other
persons, bring the hypothecary action, so that whether the property of the wife
is considered to be hers in ac-
cordance with natural law, or through legal subtlety is held to have become
part of the estate of the husband, her interest shall be fully protected by
either of these two actions, that is to say, the one in rem,or the hypothecary
action.
Every exception based upon time, such as those of usucaption, the prescription
of ten or twenty years, or of thirty or forty years, or any other whatsoever,
authorized by the lapse of a longer or shorter period, may be pleaded against
women from the time when they begin to institute legal proceedings. These terms
will run against those who are married to wealthy husbands from the day when
the marriage was dissolved, and against those whose husbands are insolvent they
will run from the time when misfortune came upon them,; for while matrimony
exists, women can exercise their hypothecary rights against the property of
husbands who are poor, as has already been prescribed by the humane provisions
of Our law; and all pretense of divorce is absolutely forbidden in cases of
this kind to which Our law has
reference.
Read seven times in the New Consistory of the Palace of Justinian.

Decius, 539.
31. The Same to Julian, Prsetorian Prefect.
When persons giving dowries for the benefit of women, whether they are their
mothers or other blood-relatives, or strangers, the husbands can receive them
without being obliged to have them recorded. When, however, a woman stipulates
for the return of a dowry under certain conditions, and the accidental
occurrence takes place, she herself is required to assign her rights of action,
or transfer the property to the person who gave the dowry, for the gift has
been decided to be void, because no record was made of it; and the result is
that the unfortunate woman may remain unendowed after many years of marriage
have passed, and even after children have been
born.
Therefore We decree that, in all these cases, no record shall be required, but
that such donations shall be valid, no matter who the parties are, and that the
woman herself shall be entitled to her dowry (when any accidental circumstance
has benefited her in this way), and that it shall remain absolutely in her
possession, unless he who gave it in the first place stipulated for its return
in a case of this kind. For then, as in the beginning, there was no supposition
that there would be any children, because he who gave the dowry stipulated that
the entire property should be returned to him; hence a discussion of this point
would be out of place. In all other instances, however, in which the owner
himself did not make such a stipulation, the woman shall, by an action of
dowry, have this peculiar consolation for the misfortune which she has
undergone.
(1) Likewise, a stranger (that is to say, one to whose authority the
beneficiary is not subject) has given an ante-nuptial donation in behalf of
another to a woman who is about to be married, and has made the necessary
record of the same, whether the donation is in
excess of the lawful amount, or the woman about to be married was not a minor,
but independent, not only will the record be sufficient for her to whom the
ante-nuptial donation was given, but will also be sufficient for the persons on
whose account it was bestowed; so that if any profit should be derived from the
dotal agreement, this shall not belong to the donor, but the husband shall
benefit by it, and shall hold it intact and irrevocable, unless the donor
stipulated for it to be returned to him under such circumstances; in order
that, in the abovementioned instance, a defect similar to the previous one may
not arise. Where, however, the donation is of trifling value, or the
transaction has been effected in such a way that the record is absolutely void,
the donation shall then be valid so far as both parties are concerned, and the
husband will profit by it, unless the donor stipulated that he himself should
have this advantage.
(2) Again, We decree that where anyone has promised lands, or a certain income,
or a house, or a public allowance of provisions, by way of dowry, or has
contracted to furnish the same, and two years have elapsed since the marriage
took place, he shall immediately furnish the income, or the rent, as well as
the public allowance of provisions, to the person entitled to the same, even if
the principal property has not yet been delivered.
When the entire dowry consists of gold and the said term of two years has
expired, he shall be required to pay interest on the same at the rate of three
per cent. But where other property, instead of land or gold, is given as dowry,
whether it consists of silver, female ornaments, clothing, or any other
articles whatsoever, and it has been appraised after the lapse of two years,
interest at three per cent can, in like manner, be collected. The appraisement
(for the reason that it is necessary to explain this clearly) is understood to
mean a valuation of articles of the same kind, or of every species of dotal
property, that is to say, when it consists of silver, ornaments, clothing, or
other personal effects, and it must not be expected that, after the separate
appraisement of each article, a combination of all of them will be made, as
this would be unnecessary and pernicious, because of offering temptation for
the exercise of too much subtlety.
If, however, the movable property should not be appraised after the lapse of
two years, those rules must be observed which the laws have prescribed with
reference to everything oT this kind, after issue has been joined in court.
When the property is of a mixed description, consisting partly of gold, and
partly of other movable or immovable possessions, everything shall proceed as
if a division had already been made, and the husband shall not be refused
permission to claim the dowry whenever he desires to do so. Nor shall he who
owes it think that if he pays the income, the rents, the interest, or any other
accessories, he has a right to defer the delivery of the dowry itself, but the
husband can demand it, either before the expiration of two years, or
afterwards, and can exact it in accordance with the laws.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Lampadius
and Orestes, 530.
TITLE XIII.
CONCERNING THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE ACTION TO RECOVER THE PROPERTY OF THE WIFE
AND THAT BASED ON A STIPULATION, AND CONCERNING THE NATURE OF THE PROPERTY
GIVEN AS DOWRY.
1. The Emperor Justinian to the People of the City of Constantinople, and to
Those of all the Provinces.
We now come to a matter of no small importance at the present time, and which
is to be found in almost all the body of the law, namely, the action with
reference to the property of the wife, and that based on a stipulation. Now,
after disposing of the resemblances and differences of the two, We intend to
unite in a single proceeding every right of action pertaining to the property
of the wife with the one resulting from the stipulation, which We think to be
worthy of attention. Therefore, having abolished the Actio rei uxoriss,We
decree that all dowries shall be recovered by means of the action based on a
stipulation, whether the latter was reduced to writing or not, in order that,
by the transaction itself, it may be understood that the stipulation was
entered into. In the same manner, if the stipulation was improperly made, it
must rather be remedied than annulled. For if one stipulation contained in the
document is found to be valid, it shall be considered to confer validity upon
others which are void; and why should not legal force be conferred by Our
Decree upon stipulations of this description? For if it is proper for Us, who
promulgate the decree, to suppose that a stipulation was made where one does
not exist, there is much more reason for one to be rendered valid which is
void.
(1) And, in order that complete relief may be afforded to dowries, as in the
case of the administration of the property of wards, and many other legal
matters, We have admitted the existence of tacit hypothecation; so also, in a
proceeding of this kind We assume hypothecation to have taken place on both
sides, on the part of the husband for the restitution of the dowry, arid on the
part of the wife for furnishing it, or against the eviction of the property of
which it is composed; whether the principal parties interested have given,
promised or received the dowry themselves, or others have done so for them; and
whether the dowry is adventitious or profectitious, in accordance with the
provisions of the ancient law.
In this law, the rusticity and ignorance of men cannot operate to their
prejudice, since in this instance We have made provision for their inexperience
and want of knowledge. For as stipulations and hypothecations are understood to
form part of dotal transactions, and stipulations which are invalid may be
corrected, so, hereafter every dotal contract shall be held to be valid and
perfect, just as if all the documents relating thereto had been drawn up by men
thoroughly learned in the law. And let no one think that, in the case of
dowries, We only have reference to such as are included in written instruments,
for. as there is nothing to prevent a dowry being given,
promised, or received without the agreement having been reduced to writing, in
like manner, a stipulation, or an hypothecation made by either party, must be
understood to exist, just as if it had been written. These matters are
understood to indicate the character of the proceeding based on the
stipulation, the Actio rei uxorisebeing from this time abolished.
(2) But although We are aware that the action based on a stipulation is one of
strict law, and was not a bona fideone; still, for the reason that the
stipulation acquires a new character for itself from the dowry, the Actio rei
uxoriseshall be applied to it, as well as those derived from good faith.
All the effects which the dowry obtains from the stipulation it shall continue
to exercise in accordance with its nature; for when, indeed, We found anything
better in the Actio rei uxoriss,We especially added it to the present one, so
that the action on stipulation which We have established may be new, and not
only adorned with its own excellence, but also with that of the ancient
proceeding.
(3) In the first place, the nature of the action on stipulation will be
explained, and if anything remains to be added from the Actio rei uxoriseit
shall be done. Hence, it should be known that the Edict of the Praetor, which
was introduced with reference to these actions, is annulled, so far as the one
on stipulation is concerned; so that the wife can receive what was left to her
by her husband, and can obtain her dowry, unless her husband has specially left
her property in lieu of it, since it is perfectly evident that a testator who
did not make this provision intended that she should have both.
(4) The right of action based on the stipulation shall pass intact, and without
delay of transmission, to the heirs.
(5) Nothing shall be stated with regard to the retention of the dowry. For why
should it be necessary to retain it on account of the morals of the woman, when
she is granted other relief by the Imperial Constitutions? Or for what reason
should retention be made of the dowry on account of any property which has been
given, when the donor has a right, by means of a direct action in rem,,or a
praetorian action, or a personal one for recovery, to provide his own remedy?
Nor is retention necessary where property has been removed, as all husbands are
entitled to an action on this ground. Let no allusion be made to retention on
account of children, as the natural impulse itself induces parents to rear
their children.
In order to prevent husbands from inventing all kinds of offences against their
wives to enable them to retain their dowries, it has already been established
by the Imperial Constitutions that marriage can be dissolved if the wife is to
blame, when it becomes necessary for this to be done. The retention of the
dowry because of expense incurred to preserve the property of which it is
composed does not seem to Us to be a sufficient cause; for, while necessary
expenses diminish the amount of the dowry, the useful ones should not be
deducted, when the Actio rei uxorisais employed, unless with the consent of the
woman; and it is not foreign to the question that her consent
should be obtained, for the action on mandate can be granted by Our authority
to the husband against the wife, to enable him by this means to obtain what he
has expended for the benefit of her property. If the consent of the woman
should not be given, and the expenses have been properly incurred, the action
on the ground of voluntary agency will be sufficient if brought against her.
When, however, the expenses were incurred for pleasure, even though this may
have been done with her consent, the husband will be permitted to remove
whatever he constructed (without, however, causing any injury to the property
as it previously existed), so that the discussion of all of these methods of
retention may finally be disposed of, and the action based on the stipulation
shall, in accordance with its nature', and with good reason, admit of no
retention.
(6) In maintaining the right of action under the stipulation, there is no doubt
whatever that if the woman should die during the existence of the marriage, her
dowry will not benefit her husband, unless some agreement was made for this
purpose. But the right of action based on the stipulation will, in accordance
with its provisions, be transmitted to the heirs of the woman, whether this was
expressed in the agreement or not, or is understood to do so by virtue of this
law.
(7) As in the case of the exaction of a dowry, the action based on the
stipulation naturally requires that restitution of the whole amount of the
dowry shall immediately be made by the husband, and it directs that this shall
be done in three annual payments, where the property is such that it can be
weighed, counted, or measured, and that not the entire amount, but only so much
as the husband can furnish, shall -be returned where he has not, with
fraudulent intent, diminished his estate. Under these circumstances, We grant
the remedy of the action on stipulation, so that where the marriage has been
dissolved, and no agreement has been made, the husband shall only have judgment
rendered against him for an amount which he is able to pay, for the reason that
this is perfectly just, and due to the respect which the husband has a right to
claim, if he has not been guilty of fraud; and he should also provide security
that, if his fortune improves, he will attempt to make good the deficiency. The
restitution of the dowry shall be made, not in payments in one, two, and three
years, but entirely within a single year, where it consists of movable
property, or of such as can move itself, or of such as is incorporeal; and any
other which is attached to the soil shall be restored without delay; which rule
applies to both actions.
If, however, the husband should fail to return the movable property, or that
which can move itself, or that which is incorporeal, after the lapse of a year,
or the land immediately after the dissolution of the marriage, he must pay
interest at the rate of three per cent upon the valuation of all which is not
immovable, which can be collected in good faith, and he must give up the crops
which have been gathered from the time that the marriage was dissolved; and, in
like manner, all rents and profits derived from transportation by ships or
beasts of burden, or from the labors of slaves, and whatever is obtained from
the public distribution of provisions, or from any other similar source, shall
be surrendered to the woman.
(8) Therefore, with reference to the following Section, the action based on the
stipulation still retains its distinctive character; so that where a woman has
been appointed heir by her husband, and a question as to the reservation of the
portion of the Falcidian Law arises, she will be permitted to deduct her dowry
from the estate of her husband, just as in the case of other debts, and
afterwards deduct the Falcidian fourth.
(9) As the action on the stipulation maintains its own character in those
instances which We have enumerated, it is necessary in the following Sections
to explain what is common to both proceedings, and show what can only be
obtained by the action on stipulation, or what is peculiar to that for the
recovery of the property of the wife, so that it may all be combined in the
action on stipulation. Hence the offspring of female slaves forming a part of
the dowry, that is to say, such as have not been appraised, as well as whatever
property the dotal slaves may have acquired in any way (except through the use
of the property of the husband, or by their own labor), is in both actions also
considered to belong to the woman. The young of beasts of burden, and
everything included under the name of crops, belong to the husband during the
time of marriage, whether they have been appraised, or not. The crops of the
last year, during which the marriage was dissolved, should be transferred to
both parties pro rata,according to the time, and of course where the property
has not been appraised, this rule applies to both actions. The husband who, as
the purchaser of property which has been appraised, enjoys the benefit of it,
must bear the loss, and is liable for the risk attending the same.
(10) The son of the deceased person who, through preference, obtains the dowry
of his wife or his daughter-in-law, by means of an action in partition, must,
in accordance with a rule peculiar to the action on stipulation, furnish his
co-heirs security that he will defend the title to the property constituting
the dowry.
(11) Therefore, let us see what ought to be taken from the action to recover
the property of the wife and added to that on stipulation. It is a positive and
undoubted rule of law that if a relative in the ascending male line, after
having provided a dowry for his daughter or granddaughter, should emancipate
her, or should himself die, by employing the Actio rei uxorise,the dowry will
absolutely belong to the woman, even if she had been disinherited (which was
not the case in the action on stipulation, for it, like other actions, was
divided among all the heirs).
It seems to Us to be perfectly just that the woman should receive her dowry
through preference by an action on stipulation, whether she was emancipated or
disinherited, or appointed with other heirs.
(12) This rule having been adopted by Us, many others have been promptly
disposed of, as the dowry can exclude the action for in-
officiousness (especially if it is equal in amount to the fourth prescribed by
law), and can be placed in the mass of the estate, if the head of the household
should die intestate; or if, having executed a will, the testator made this
provision. All these matters have been derived from the Actio rei uxorise,and
incorporated into the action on stipulation.
(13) Another provision derived from the action to recover the property of the
wife has been added to the action on stipulation. For when a stranger, no
matter who he might be, gave a dowry, without having made any stipulation or
agreement with reference to its return to himself, the woman could bring the
Actio rei uxorise,which right was not formerly included in the action on
stipulation.
Where a stipulation was made, or an agreement entered into, the stipulator, or
he who made the agreement, was entitled to a civil action under the
stipulation, or one prgsscriptis verbis.At the present time, however, We do not
wish this to be done, but where the stranger, in giving the dowry, did not
especially stipulate or provide that it should be returned to him, it is then
presumed that the woman herself made the stipulation, and that, under the
circumstances, the dowry should be acquired by her. Nor do We desire that, in
an instance of this kind, a stranger shall be considered to have made a tacit
stipulation, in order that what We have introduced for the benefit of women may
not be employed to their disadvantage; nay more, in dowries like these, which
are either given or promised by .strangers, the woman herself is considered to
have made a tacit stipulation, unless the stranger expressly agreed or
stipulated that the dowry should be returned to him; as, by not having entered
into a stipulation, he is considered rather to have made a donation to the
woman than a provision for his own benefit.
We understand by the term "stranger" every person, with the exception of a
relative of the male sex in the ascending line, who does not have the female
who is endowed under his control, for We grant a tacit right Of action based on
the stipulation to a relative of this description.
(14) The following provision, also derived from the Actio rei uxorise,has also
been included in the action'on stipulation. For when, after the marriage has
been dissolved, the dowry is claimed by the father of the woman, if there was
ground for the action to recover the property of the wife, he could not proceed
alone without the consent of the daughter. And if he should die before suit was
brought, or even after issue had been joined, the dowry would revert to the
daughter as a part of her own property. This, however, was not the case in the
action on stipulation, for there the father alone had the right to exact the
dowry, without waiting for the consent of his daughter, and if he died, he
transmitted it to his heirs. But it is sufficiently humane, sufficiently
dutiful, and sufficiently advantageous to marriage, for the right attaching to
the action, to recover the property of the wife to be transferred to the action
on stipulation.
Extract from Novel 97, Ciiapter V. Latin Text.
But although the dowry may be returned to the father, either by the right of
paternal control, or under the terms of an agreement, he, nevertheless, is not
permitted to diminish the original amount of it, when his daughter marries a
second time, unless his estate has been lessened by some accidental misfortune,
for then he is not compelled to furnish any larger dowry to the second husband
than his means will permit.
END OP THE EXTRACT.
THE TEXT OP THE CODE FOLLOWS.
(15) And as the Lex Juliaforbade the alienation of dotal land situated in Italy
to be made by the husband, without the permission of his wife, and also did not
permit him to hypothecate it, if his wife had not consented, We have been asked
if it was not necessary for a provision of this kind to apply not only to lands
in Italy, but to all others. Hence We have decided to extend this rule so as to
include not only lands in Italy, but also to those of the province. As,
however, We have, by this law, given the right of hypothecation to the woman,
she has a sufficient remedy, if her husband should desire to alienate the land,
but to prevent her from voluntarily impairing her right of hypothecation, it
becomes necessary under such circumstances to come to the relief of women; and
hence We have added that a husband cannot only not hypothecate land forming
part of the dowry, without the consent of his wife, but that he cannot alienate
it, lest, through the weakness of his nature, he may suddenly be reduced to
poverty.
For although the Anastasian Law treats of the consent of women, and of those
who renounce their rights, still, it must be understood with reference to the
property of the husband, or to a dowry which has been appraised, that, as the
ownership of the same belongs to the husband, he will also be responsible for
the risk.
So far, however, as land which has not been appraised, and which is very
properly styled dotal is concerned, the right which was incomplete under the
Julian Law, but has been fully provided for by Ours, shall remain intact, and
shall not only be observed in Italy, but in all other lands, and can be
abrogated solely by hypothecation.
(16) We have considered it necessary to add as a general provision to the
present law, that, when any agreements have been made for the restitution of
the dowry, or for time, or for interest, or for anything else which is not
contrary to the laws or constitutions, they shall be executed. Where, however,
the marriage has been dissolved by repudiation, all the rights included either
in the Theodosian Law or Ours shall be preserved intact.
In like manner, the provisions enumerated in the Anastasian Law, with reference
to persons separated by common consent, shall remain firm and unimpaired.
And, generally speaking, whatever has been provided by the Sacred
Constitutions, or by the works of learned jurists, which is not found to be
opposed to this law, shall remain in full force, and be included
in the action on stipulation; even though it may have been discussed under the
action for the recovery of the property of the wife.
We direct that these rules shall only apply to dowries which have been given or
promised after the promulgation of this law, even if they have not been reduced
to writing. For We do not permit instruments that have been already drawn up to
be deprived of their force, but time must be given for them to take effect.
Given on the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of Lam-padius and
Orestes, 530.
TITLE XIV.
CONCERNING AGREEMENTS MADE WITH REFERENCE TO DOWRIES AND ANTE-NUPTIAL
DONATIONS, AS WELL AS SUCH AS RELATE TO THE PRIVATE PROPERTY OP THE
WIFE.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Nica.
The condition which you impose when you give a dowry to a ward whom you have
brought up must be observed, and the objection ordinarily interposed, namely,
that a right of action is not derived from the contract, cannot be raised, for
We only state this when a contract is without consideration. It is otherwise
when money is given, and an agreement is entered into with reference to its
repayment ; for then an equitable action will lie for its recovery.
Given on the seventh of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulship of
Albinus and ^milianus, 207.
2. The Emperor Antoninus to Theodota.
You should entertain no doubt that the income from land given by way of dowry
cannot be recovered, where, in accordance with an agreement, it has been used
for your expenses.
Given on the eleventh of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of
Antoninus, Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
3. The Emperor Gordian to Torquata. :
Although your father, when he gave you in marriage, may have agreed that, if
your husband should die leaving children belonging to you both, a portion of
the dowry should be retained in their name, still, an agreement of this kind
can be of no benefit so long as you are entitled to an action to recover the
entire amount of the dowry.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof January, during the Consulate of Gordian and
Aviola, 214.
4. The Same to Agathus.
When you allege that, by the dotal contract in accordance with which your
mother agreed with your father that if she died during marriage, the dowry
should be restored to you and your brothers, the stipulation with reference to
you will not be legal, if you were
not all under the control of your father, and if she should die during the
marriage, an action in your behalf will not lie. Where, however, a verbal
obligation was properly contracted, you will have the right to demand the
dowry, and will not be prevented from asserting your claim, especially if you
are no longer subject to paternal authority.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof June, during the Consulate of Sabinus and
Venustus, 241.
5. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Claudius.
An estate passes by will to strangers. Therefore, when you assert that by a
dotal instrument, an agreement instead of a will was interposed, by the terms
of which, after the death of the wife, her property, to which you are not
entitled as dowry, will belong to you, you are advised that you cannot, by any
proceeding, sue her heirs or successors, in order that what is in no way due
may be delivered to you.
Given on the Nonesof February, during the Consulate of the abovementioned
Emperors.
6. The Same Emperors and Czesars to Rufus.
Where it was agreed that if the wife should die during marriage, the dowry
should remain in the hands of the husband, it is established by law that an
agreement of this kind precludes the recovery of the dowry which came from the
father, as it has frequently been determined by legal authority that the
condition of the dowry, of which the father has the sole right of recovery,
cannot be rendered worse by a contract.
7. The Same Emperors and Cassars to Philetus.
Where a father agreed that a dowry given for his daughter to his son-in-law
should be transferred to his grandchildren, if she should die first during the
marriage, although he cannot bring suit in their behalf, still, a pratorian
action will lie for their benefit in accordance with the principles of equity.
Given at Nicomedia, on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the
Consulate of the Csesars.
8. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Hormisdas, Prse-torian Prefect.
We decree by this law that the husband shall not interfere with any of the
property which his wife has exclusive of her dowry, and which the Greeks
designate as parapherna,if she forbids him to do so, nor can he impose any
necessity upon her in this respect. For, although it is well that the wife, who
entrusts herself to her husband, should also permit her property to be
controlled by his judgment, still, as it is only proper that the legislators
should comply with the rules of equity, We are not willing (as has already been
stated) that the husband should in any way meddle with the property of the wife
against her consent.
Given during the Idesof ...
9. The Emperors Leo and Anthemius to Necostratus, Prsetorian Prefect.
We decree that, at the death of either the husband or wife, he or she shall be
entitled to the same share, and not the same amount of money that the husband
would be entitled to from the dowry, or the wife from the ante-nuptial
donation; for instance, if the husband had given an ante-nuptial donation of a
hundred solidi,the wife shall be permitted to give a dowry of a smaller or a
larger amount; and the husband shall be allowed to give an ante-nuptial
donation in the same way.
It should, however, be observed that whatever amount the wife stipulates to
give up out of the ante-nuptial donation, if her husband should happen to die
first, the husband also should stipulate for himself concerning the dowry (but
not with regard to a sum of money), if the wife should be the first to die
during marriage. When an agreement is made contrary to what is herein provided,
We order that it shall be null and void, and that no recovery can take place by
virtue of it.
We decree that the same rule shall be observed where a father has given or
promised an ante-nuptial donation, in behalf of his son, or a mother, or the
future husband, provided he is his own master, or anyone else whosoever, has
done so in behalf of the future bride. In like manner, if the father or mother,
or the future wife, if she is her own mistress, or someone else, should give or
promise a dowry in her behalf to her future husband, she herself will be
considered to have tendered the dowry, when it is offered by any other person
for her benefit. This is true to the extent that she can claim for herself the
dowry tendered by another in her behalf, unless he who tendered it may have
stipulated or agreed immediately (that is to say, at the time of the offer or
promise), that the aforesaid dowry should be returned to him.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof September, during the second Consulate
of the Emperor Anthemius, 408.
Extract from Novel 97, Chapter I. Latin Text.
Equality should, by all means, be observed with reference to dowries and ante-
nuptial donations, not merely concerning the profit which may be derived from
them, but also with regard to the guarantee and constitution of both, and no
increase in the same shall be made by anyone; or, in case this is done, the
amount of the augmentation must be the same on both sides, in order that the
equality may not in this way be destroyed.
Extract from Novel 2, Last Chapter. Latin Text.
Where, however, the wife has given nothing of the dowry agreed upon, she can
receive nothing whatever from the ante-nuptial donation, in case of the death
of her husband. Likewise, if she gave less than she promised, she can only
benefit by an amount in proportion to what she bestowed.
10. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Pr&torian Prefect.
In accordance with a law of the Emperor Leo, of Divine Memory, it is provided
that agreements with reference to dowries and antenuptial donations should
agree with reference to the amounts, but nothing was added as to what should be
done if this rule was not observed; and We, desiring that everything should be
clear, do hereby order that, where the amounts are unequal, the larger one
should be reduced so as to correspond with the smaller, in order that, in this
way, both parties may obtain amounts equal to the smaller one.
Given at Constantinople, on the eighth of the Idesof April, during the
Consulate of Decius, 529.
11. The Same to John, Prastorian Prefect.
Where a woman has given evidences of debt to her husband (that is to say notes,
bearing interest) which are not included in her dowry, with the intention that
they shall remain in the hands of her husband as her own private property, and
this has been inserted into the dotal contract, the question arose whether the
husband would be entitled to any action either direct or equitable, growing out
of the transaction, or whether the notes would all remain with the wife, and
under what circumstances the right to bring suit should be granted to the
husband. Therefore, We order that if anything of this kind should take place,
the right of action shall by all means remain with the wife, but that
permission shall be granted the husband to institute proceedings before
competent judges; that no guarantee of ratification shall be required of him;
and that any interest derived from said securities shall be expended for the
benefit of himself and his wife, but any money forming part of the principal
which he may collect, shall be used for the benefit of the wife, or shall be
employed for any purpose to which she may give her consent.
If, however, it is expressly stated in the dotal instrument that the said
securities shall be hypothecated for the property of the husband, the wife must
remain content with this hypothecation. But if this is not found to be included
in the dotal contract, under Our present law, she will be entitled to a lien on
the property of her husband, from the time when he collected the money. For,
before the wife herself will have the power (if she should desire to exercise
it) to bring any actions, either by her husband or by other parties, collect
the money, and receive the said notes from her husband, proper security should
be given him. While the said notes remain in his hands, he will be responsible
for fraud, and must display the same diligence with reference to them which he
is found to exercise concerning his own property, in order that his wife may
not suffer loss through neglect or criminality on his part. If this should
happen, he himself will be compelled to indemnify the wife out of his own
property.
Given on the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of Lam-padius and
Orestes, 530.
TITLE XV. CONCERNING DOWRY PROVIDED FOR BUT NOT PAID.
1. The Divine Severus and Antoninus to Dionysia.
Payment, and not the contents of the dotal instrument, constitutes a dowry;
therefore you are aware that you cannot be permitted to demand your dowry
unless you prove that it has actually been given by you.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Chilo
and Libo, 205.
2. The Emperor Alexander to Papiniana.
Whatever a husband has added out of his own property to the dowry, with the
intention of giving it during the existence of the marriage, can be demanded by
the heirs of the husband, to the extent that his liberality was exercised, if
he should die during the marriage and did not revoke the said donation which
was lawfully made and given as a dotal increase.
Given on the Nonesof December, during the Consulate of the Emperor Alexander,
Consul for the third time, and Dio, 230.
3. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Prastorian Prefect.
With reference to dowries which it is customary to mention in dotal instruments
as having been given, when in fact they have not yet been paid, but only a
promise has been made to pay them, it shall be lawful to interpose the
exception based on the non-payment of money, not only by the husband against
the wife or her heirs, when the marriage has been dissolved either by the death
or the repudiation of the wife, but also by the heirs of the husband, where the
marriage has been dissolved by his death, and by the father-in-law or his
heirs; if it was stated in the dotal instrument that he received a dowry along
with his son, as well as against every person who is stated in writing to have
received the dowry with the husband, and his heirs; provided, however, that
this privilege shall be granted only within a continuous year from the death of
the husband or the wife, or from the date of the notice of repudiation.
Given on the Kalendsof July, during the Second Consulate of Our Lord, the
Emperor Justinian.
Extract from Novel 100, Chapter II. Latin Text.
This takes place where the marriage is dissolved within the space of two years.
If this should occur after the expiration of two years, but before the tenth
year has elapsed, the husband himself, as well as his heir, shall have the
right to make complaint within the term of three months. Where, however, the
period of ten years has elapsed, no complaint shall, under any circumstances,
be permitted, but the right to complete restitution shall be allowed, above
all, if minority is involved in the case.
TITLE XVI.
CONCERNING DONATIONS MADE BETWEEN HUSBAND AND WIFE, AND BY PARENTS TO THEIR
CHILDREN, AND CONCERNING RATIFICATION.
1." The Emperor Antoninus to Triphena.
Since the Treasury has taken possession of the property of your husband as
being without an owner, he having left no heirs, any donations made by him
cannot be revoked, if he continued in the same mind to the end of his life.
Given on the third of the Idesof January, under the Consulate of the two
Aspers, 213.
2. The Same to the Soldier Marcus.
If you prove before the Governor of the province that the female slave in
question was purchased with your money, even though it was stated in the bill
of sale that she was destined as a gift to your concubine, he must order her to
be restored to you; for although this donation may be valid where matrimony
does not exist, still I am unwilling that my soldiers should, by means of
perfidious blandish-^ ments, be plundered in this way by their concubines.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of the
Emperor Antoninus, Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
3. The Same to Epictetus.
The donation of slaves and other property which you say was made to you by your
wife was confirmed by a Constitution of mine and my Divine Father Severus,
provided that she was her own mistress when she made the donation, or did so
with the consent of her father, and remained of the same mind with reference to
it until the last day of her life. If, however, the donation was made by your
father-in-laW after the death of his daughter, it also will be valid as a
donation inter vivos.
Given on the fourth of the Nonesof March, during the Consulate of the Emperor
Antoninus, Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
4. The Same to Claudian.
Donations cannot, under the Civil Law, be made between persons to whom the
husband and wife are legally subject, and where either of them is under their
control.
Given on the third of the Idesof August, under the Consulate of the two Aspers,
213.
5. The Emperor Alexander to Quintilla.
If (as you state) your father was under the control of the same person that you
were, and gave as a donation to your husband (his
son-in-law) a certain instrument executed by a debtor, and died during your
marriage, and you were afterwards separated from your husband, the transaction
is not valid.
Given on the Idesof February, under the Consulate of Albinus and Maximus, 228.
6. The Same to Nepotianus.
Although property which belonged to you by law was deposited in the name of
your wife, the title to the same cannot be affected on this account, even
though anyone may suppose that by this transaction you have donated your
property to her, as a donation made during marriage, and before the death of
the wife who profited by the liberality, is void. Nor is it unknown that the
ancient legislators very correctly held the opinion that, when a wife cannot
explain how she acquired property honorably during marriage, she is presumed to
have obtained it from the estate of her husband.
Given on the Nonesof December, during the Consulate of the Emperor Alexander,
Consul for the third time, and Dio, 230.
7. The Same to Theodota.
Where, in accordance with the will of your father, you married the son of your
guardian, the donation made to your husband is void in law. If, however, the
marriage is not legally valid (although the donation in this case is not void)
for the reason that the person who cannot be called your husband, is unworthy,
equitable actions for the recovery of the donation will lie in your favor.
Given on the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of Rufus and Maximus, 233.
8. The Same to Leo.
If you permitted your wife to take the crops of the land which you received as
dowry, during the time of marriage, and she consumed them, you demand without
reason that they shall be restored to you, after a divorce has taken place. If,
however, she was enriched by them, she can be sued for the excess.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of Maximus
and Paternus, 234.
9. The Emperor Gordian to Origen.
Although slaves have been purchased by your wife with your money, still, if
they were delivered to her, their ownership belongs not to you but to her, and
you only have a right to recover the money, whether you made the payment while
transacting her business, or you gave her the amount of the price as a
donation. Hence you can bring a competent action against her for the entire sum
or for the amount by which she has become enriched.
Given on the seventh of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of Pius and
Pontianus, 239.
10. The Same to Valerian.
If the former husband of your wife, being his own master, gave her lands or
other property as a donation, and' continued in the same mind up to the time of
his death, the donation will be confirmed by a Rescript of the Divine Severus.
But if the father of the deceased unjustly took the property, he will be
compelled by the Governor of the province to return it; for even if the death
of the husband was caused by the wickedness of his wife, he, while imputing to
her the offence, should not, under the pretext of the accusation, deprive her
of the property given to her, as a case where liberality is involved differs
from a criminal accusation.
Given on the seventh of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of Arian
and Pappus, 244.
11. The Same to Maximus.
Just as a claim for the amount which the husband promised his wife every month,
or every year, for her own private use, cannot be allowed, so, it is clear
that, for the same reason, money paid and expended on this account cannot be
recovered.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of the Emperor
Gordian, Consul for the second time, and Pompeianus, 242.
12. The Same to Secundina.
If your husband, having become involved in debt, encumbered to his creditors
land previously given to you as a donation, and which you, on this ground,
claim under your rights, you are advised that the said obligation interferes
with your defence; for it is evident that a donation made by a husband to his
wife is not only revoked by an obligation of this kind, but also by a donation
or sale of his property, or by any other mode of alienation of the same
whatsoever.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of Arian and
Pappus, 244.
13. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Rufina.
If (as you state) the land given to you as a donation by your husband was
encumbered by him to his creditors, there is no doubt that the alienation will
be valid after the deduction of the amount of the indebtedness (that is, where
the policy of the law does not deprive the creditor of his right of action).
If, however, the donation was legally made, either because this was done before
marriage, or under the circumstances in which a donation is allowed to take
place during its existence, the obligation is invalid, for it is certain that
the act of your husband, whom you allege is dead, cannot affect your rights.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and Aquilinus, 286.
14. The Same to Octaviana.
The right to demand a legacy or a trust is not, by any means, conferred by the
mere insertion of words in last wills, although they
may be useful for the purpose of trusts or legacies, but this is only the case
where expressions are inserted with the intention of bequeathing the property;
hence, it is clear that the matter contained in your petition involves a
question of intent, and not of law. Therefore, after having read the will, We
notice that your husband, by a preceding donation, reserved the ownership of
the property for you, and afterwards stated that you should obtain it for your
greater security, and the meaning of the words does not indicate that a trust
was left, but that your husband authorized by the Decree of the Senate, when
about to die, provided that the gift of the ownership of the property should be
confirmed, and secured to you, as far as this could be done at the time of his
decease.
Given on the third of the Nonesof October, under the Consulate of the same
Emperors.
15. The Same to Justus and Others.
If your father did not enter into a true contract, but donated the possession
of certain property to your mother by a species of sale, and the remainder of
his estate was not sufficient to satisfy the Treasury for what was due from him
as Chief Centurion of the Triarii, although he did not change his mind with
reference to the donation, still, recourse must be had to the identical
property for the purpose of making up the amount which could not be collected
from what was left by him. If, however, your father, by changing his mind,
interrupted the course of his bounty, there is no doubt that the ownership of
the said property will revert to his estate.
Given on the fourth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of
Tyberianus and Dio, 291.
16. The Same to Theodore.
If your emancipated sons should acquire for themselves the estate of their
mother, prove before the Governor of the province that you did not purchase the
land in question in the name of your wife for the purpose of giving it to her,
but that you have already made use of her name, which you can do by showing
that the ownership of the said land was transferred to you by the vendors,
through their giving possession of the same, so that the injustice of your
children having been exposed, your title to the property may remain unimpaired.
If, however, you did this with the intention of bestowing the land upon her,
the right of action to recover the purchase-money will lie in your favor.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Tyberianus and
Dio, 291.
17. The Same Emperors and Cassars to Capitolina.
With reference to the property brought into the house in addition to the dowry,
and which you allege has been consumed by your husband, if this was done by you
for the purpose of making a donation, you are informed that you will only have
a right of action against
the heirs for the amount by which your husband profited. If, however, he used
the property against your consent, the whole of it must be returned to you.
Given at Heraclea, on the eighth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate
of the same Emperors, 291.
18. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Materna.
Where a donation is made by a husband to his wife during marriage, the
ownership of the property cannot be transferred in the beginning; nor
afterwards, if a divorce should take place, or if the person who is the
recipient of the bounty should die first; nor can it subsequently become valid,
if it has been revoked by him who gave it.
Given on the fourth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of the
same Emperors.
19. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Dionysia.
If your mother transferred a house to you during your marriage she renders it
part of your property.
Given on the Idesof July, at Philippopolis, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
20. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Claudia.
Acreditor, after his debt has been paid, cannot transfer to the wife of his
former debtor any of the pledges which has been released, nor will the consent
of the said debtor, acceded to by his former creditor, avail to any extent to
transfer the ownership of the property by a fictitious sale; as not only
simulated transactions, but also such as have reference to donations of
property to a wife by her husband during marriage, are considered as never
having been made on account of their prohibition by the Civil Law (when you
suppose the case that a wife is survived by her husband).
21. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Maucalia.
Where, by engagements which you yourself contracted, you borrowed money and
spent it for your husband, with the intention of considering it a donation, as
this has been done for a worthy purpose, and your husband has not been enriched
thereby, you should understand that an action will not lie in your favor
against him.
Given on the third of the Idesof August, during the Consulate of the Caasars.
22. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Archinoa.
A husband can give a slave to his wife during marriage, with the intention of
manumitting him.
Given on the Kalends ofAugust, during the Consulate of the Caesars.
23. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Csecilianus.
If your mother-in-law placed you in possession of a certain tract of land as a
donation, either before or after your marriage, her change of mind will avail
nothing for the purpose of revoking the gift.
Given on the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of the Csesars.
24. The Emperors Constantine to Petronius Probinus.
Any property of a wife, which may have come into her possession through
inheritance, purchase, or the gift of her husband made before he was criminally
accused, if the latter should be condemned to death, or reduced to a servile
condition by way of penalty, shall remain intact; nor shall she be oppressed by
the misfortune of another's crime, as it is only just that she should, in
accordance with the laws, enjoy the property derived from her father or mother,
as well as that which she herself has acquired; and any donation made by the
husband before he was accused of crime, for the reason that it is regarded as
the recompense of modesty, should stand, just as if the course of nature, and
not punishment, had removed him.
When, however, he has been forbidden the use of water and fire, or has been
sentenced to deportation, and death did not result from the penalty, any
donations made by him to his wife will remain in abeyance, because in cases of
this kind the marriage is not dissolved; so that if the husband should not
revoke them during his lifetime, they will be confirmed by his death, and Our
Treasury will not afterwards have any claim upon such property.
Given on the second of the Kalendsof March, at Sardinia, during the second
Consulate of the Csesars Crispus and Constantius, 321.
Extract from Novel 22, Chapter Vill. Latin Text.
But, at the present day, no one originally well born can be rendered a slave by
way of punishment for crime, and therefore marriage is not dissolved for this
reason.
25. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Prsetorian Prefect.
We order that donations made by parents for the benefit of their children of
either sex, who are under their control, or those made by a wife for the
benefit of her husband, or by a husband for the benefit of his wife, or by
either of them in behalf of a third party to whom it is not lawful to make a
donation during marriage, or for the benefit of any person to whom they cannot
make a donation, shall be rendered valid by the silence of the donor, if they
reach the amount authorized by law or exceed it, and have been recorded, for We
do not permit a donation of a larger sum than is legal to be recorded, or
confirmed by the silence of the person who made it.
When, however, the donor specifically confirms such donations by his or her
last will, they shall be considered as ratified without any distinction, so
that if they exceed the amount provided for by law, and have not been recorded,
their explicit confirmation shall be valid from the time when this took place.
But if the donation is not excessive, or if it is larger than is sanctioned by
law, and has been recorded, then the silence of the donor, and the special
confirmation by either him or her shall revert to the time when the donation
was made, just
as it is necessary to refer other ratifications of business matters to the date
of the execution of the contracts. Nor can any subtle distinction between law
and fact be introduced.
Given on the Idesof December, during the second Consulate of Our Lord, the
Emperor Justinian, 528.
26. The Same to Menna, Prsetorian Prefect.
We order that the donations which the Divine Emperor has made in favor of the
most pious Queen, his wife, and those which she has made in favor of her most
serene husband, shall immediately be valid, and be fully confirmed, for the
reason that Imperial Contracts take the place of laws, and require no external
assistance.
Given on the eighth of the Idesof April, during the Consulate of Decius, 529.
27. The Same to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
Where anyone who was united in marriage, after having made a donation for the
benefit of another, is taken by the enemy and reduced to slavery, and
subsequently dies in captivity, the question arose whether a gift of this kind,
which he had previously made, would be confirmed or weakened by this
occurrence. It was also asked if the donor should die in Roman territory, and
he who received the donation was in captivity at the time of his death, and
afterwards returned, whether the donation would then be held to have been
confirmed. Therefore, as in both these instances, the doubt should be removed
by an Imperial remedyfor there is nothing so peculiar to the majesty of the
Empire as humanity, by means of which alone the imitation of God is
preservedWe decree that, in both these cases, the donation shall be valid.
Given on the Kalendsof December, under the Consulate of Lam-padius and Orestes,
530.

CONCERNING REPUDIATION AND THE ABOLITION OP THE ACTION DE MoRiBus.1

Marriage is not dissolved by deportation or by the interdiction of water and
fire, if the state into which the husband has fallen does not
1 Little is known concerning the Actio de moribus mulieris,which was a personal
one of a penal character, in which the return of the dowry was involved. It was
resorted to in case of the criminality, infidelity, drunkenness, or other
serious misconduct of the wife, and the court was authorized to impose a fine
at his discretion. "Vir cum divortium fecit, mulieri judex pro censore est,
imperium quod videtur habet, si quid perverse tsetreque factum est a muliere,
multitatur; si vinum bibit, si cum alieno probri quid fecit, condempnatur."

If the husband was aware of her character before he married her, he forfeited
all claim to the dowry.ED.
alter the affection of the wife. Therefore the exaction of the dowry is not
competent by law, but neither the rules of equity nor any examples permit that
she whose attachment is worthy of praise should remain unendowed.
Given on the Nonesof November, during the Consulate of the Emperor Alexander,
Consul for the third time, and Dio, 230.
2. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus, and the Cassar Valerian to Paulina.
Your daughter is free to marry if, having waited for her betrothed for three
years, and all hope of this union having been lost, she does not think that she
should wait any longer, and thereby miss an opportunity for marriage, as, even
if the man is present and she should change her mind, she can serve notice on
him to that effect.
Given on the seventh of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of
.aCmilianus and Bassus, 260.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Tullius.
There is no doubt that everything transacted properly and after due
consideration is, by law and reason, rendered firm and valid. Wherefore, if you
gave a dowry for the benefit of a woman, and stipulated for its return at the
time of her death, and a fictitious repudiation has been made for the purpose
of deceiving you, and the marriage is rescinded for a short time, the Governor
of the province shall entertain no doubt that you are entitled to receive the
dotal property which you offered before the marriage, for it is certain that
the above-named official should see that whatever has been done contrary to
justice does not profit those who have resorted to cunning to evade the law,
for schemes of this kind are displeasing to Us.
It has also been decided by the ancient legal authorities that fictitious
notices, that is to say those of repudiation, are of no effect, whether the
parties pretend to have renounced either their marriage or betrothal.
Given on the second of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of the
same Emperors and Caesars.
4. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Piso.The divorce of a daughter is not under
control of her mother. Given on the third of the Kalendsof January, during the
Consulate of the Caesars.
5. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Schyro.
Our Father, and most religious Emperor the Divine Marcus, decided that the
consent of a parent should not be considered as ratified where he gave his
consent to the marriage in the beginning and afterwards revoked it, and the
daughter under paternal control decided to remain with her husband, unless the
act of the father was caused by some good and sufficient reason. No rule of law
directs a wife to return to her husband against her consent. The father of an
emancipated daughter cannot, at will, authorize her divorce.
Given at Nicomedia, on the fifth of the Kalendsof September, during the
Consulate of the Caesars.
Extract from Novel 22, Chapter XIX. Latin Text.
And, on the other hand, a new constitution with reference to marriage sets
forth what is the law where the children subject to paternal authority desire
to be divorced against the wishes of their parents. That is to say, that
marriages shall not be dissolved to the injury of the parents, who either
alone, or along with their children, have offered or received a dowry, or an
ante-nuptial donation; for the reason that as the consent of parents is
required in contracting marriage, so, also, it is necessary for the purpose of
dissolving it.
6. The Same Emperors and Cassars to Phcebus.
Although the written notice of repudiation may not have been delivered to the
husband, or he may not have been aware of it, the marriage will, nevertheless,
be dissolved.
Given at Nicomedia, on the eighteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the
Consulate of the Caesars.
7. The Emperors Constantine to Dalmatius.
Awife who, after the lapse of four years from the time of the departure of her
husband for the army, has been unable to obtain any tidings of his safety, and
therefore is thinking of contracting another marriage, still should not do so
before sending notice of her intention to the general of the army, for then she
will not be considered to have contracted a clandestine marriage; nor will she
sustain the loss of her dowry, or be liable to capital punishment, who, when so
long a time has elapsed, is proved to have married, not rashly or stealthily,
but after a public announcement of her intention has been made. Therefore it
should be noted that, where no suspicion of adultery exists, and no clandestine
marriage is disclosed, no danger need be apprehended by those who have
contracted matrimony under such circumstances, since, if the marriage has been
knowingly and secretly violated, the law will impose the proper punishment.
Given during the Consulate of Felicianus and Titian, 337.
Extract from Novel 117, Chapter XI. Latin Text.
To-day, no matter how many years the husband may remain in the army, the wife
should be patient, although she may have received neither letters nor tidings
from him. If she hears that he is dead, she ought not to marry again before
either going herself, or sending someone to the officer under whom her husband
served, and interrogating him as to whether he is actually dead or not, so that
the said officer may swear in court that the husband is no longer living, which
having taken place, the woman may marry after a year has elapsed. If, however,
she should do so without taking this precaution, she, as well as the man who
marries her, shall be punished as guilty of adultery.
Where the person who took the oath is convicted of having sworn falsely, he
shall be dismissed from the army, and shall pay ten pounds of gold to him whom
he falsely stated to be dead, and the latter shall have permission to recover
his wife if he desires to do so.
8. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Hormisdas, Prse-torian Prefect.
We decree that legal marriage may be contracted by consent, but this having
once been done, that it cannot be dissolved unless by notice of repudiation,
for the favor to which children are entitled demands that its dissolution
should be rendered more difficult.
(1) We clearly enumerate the causes of repudiation by this most salutary law,
for as We (with proper limitations) forbid marriage to be dissolved without
good cause, so that where one of the parties is compelled by necessity, or the
other is oppressed by some misfortune, We desire that he or she shall be
liberated by Our aid, when this becomes necessary.
(2) Therefore, if a woman should ascertain that her husband is an adulterer, a
homicide, a poisoner, or one who is plotting anything against Our government;
or has been convicted of perjury or forgery, or is a violator of sepulchres, or
has stolen anything from sacred buildings; or is a robber or a harborer of
robbers, a cattle thief or a kidnapper; or, in contempt of his house and of
her, or in her presence, has consorted with dissolute women (which is
especially exasperating to females who are chaste) ; or if he has attempted to
deprive her of life by poison, or by the sword, or in any other way; or if she
should prove that he had beaten her (which is not allowed in the case of
freeborn women), We then grant her permission to avail herself of the necessary
aid of repudiation, and to present legal reasons for divorce.
Extract from Novel 117, Chapter IX. Latin Text.
By the new law, however, a husband who has done this without any cause shall be
compelled to surrender to his wife, even during marriage, out of his other
property, an amount equal to the third part of the ante-nuptial donation which
he made, but the marriage shall not be dissolved on this account.
END OF THE EXTRACT.
THE TEXT OF THE CODE FOLLOWS.
(3) The husband, also, is controlled by similar restrictions, for he shall not
be permitted to repudiate his own wife, except for reasons which have been
clearly designated; nor can she be driven away under any circumstances, unless
he should find her to be an adulteress, a poisoner, a homicide, a kidnapper, a
violator of sepulchres; or one who has stolen something from sacred buildings;
or an accomplice of thieves; or one given to frequenting banquets where strange
men are present, her husband either being ignorant of the fact or having
withheld his consent; or where, without his permission, and without good
and reasonable cause, she has passed the night in some public resort, or
frequented the circus, theatre, or the exhibitions of the arena, in those
places in which they are usually conducted, in spite of his opposition; or if
she has attempted to kill him by poison, by the sword, or by any other means;
or where she is cognizant of any plots against Our government; or has been
implicated in the crime of forgery or perjury; or he can prove that she has
laid violent hands upon him. For, under these circumstances, We necessarily
grant him the right of separation, and the power to establish the causes of
divorce in accordance with the laws.
(4) If neither the husband nor the wife should observe these regulations, he or
she shall be punished with the avenging penalty of this most provident law. For
if a woman, in contempt of the law, should attempt to send a notice of
repudiation, she shall forfeit her dowry and her ante-nuptial donation, and
shall not have the power to marry again within five years, for it is just that,
in the meantime, she should be forbidden marriage, of which she has shown
herself unworthy.
If, however, she should marry in spite of this provision, she herself shall
become infamous, and We are unwilling that her union shall be designated
marriage, and, in addition to this, We grant authority to anyone to attack it
who desires to do so. But if she should prove the case which she has stated,
she shall then recover her dowry, and profit by her ante-nuptial donation; and
We decree that she shall have the right to claim them by law, and We grant her
permission to marry after the expiration of a year, in order that no doubt may
arise with reference to her offspring.
(5) We order by the following just regulation that the husband, also, who can
prove that his wife has attempted to commit unlawful acts, can claim not only
the dowry but also the ante-nuptial donation, and that he can immediately take
another wife, if he wishes. But if, on the other hand, he should merely desire
to repudiate his wife, he must return the dowry, and lose the ante-nuptial
donation.
(6) Where the crime of adultery or treason is alleged, the male and female
slaves of both the husband and wife who have 'reached puberty should be
subjected to torture for the purpose of ascertaining the cause of repudiation,
by which the truth may the more readily be ascertained, or more clearly
revealed, provided other sources of proof are lacking. We desire that the same
evidence shall be admitted in the case of wounds having been inflicted by
either of the parties (as has already been stated), since the truth of matters
which take place in the household is not easily established by the testimony of
strangers.
(7) If notice of repudiation is given and there are any children, either sons
or daughters living, We order that whatever was obtained by the marriage shall
be preserved for the benefit of the said sons or daughters, after the death of
the person who received it; that is to say, if the father should rashly serve
notice of repudiation, the antenuptial donation shall be preserved by the
mother; if the mother
should do so, the dowry, on the death of the father, shall be transferred to
the child, or children. Still, the father or mother will have the right to
appoint as heir or heirs one, or all of the children, or to make a donation of
his or her property to any one of them, in accordance with his or her choice.
We do not grant the power to alienate or substitute any of the above-mentioned
property. When, however, any of it is lacking, We order that it shall be made
good, either by the heirs, or by those having it in their possession (provided
the parties do not appoint any heirs, or the children who were appointed do not
enter upon the estate) so that, in this way, the children may not suffer injury
through the inconsiderate notice of repudiation.
(8) Where any agreements are made in opposition to Our present decree, We
desire they shall have no validity, as being contrary
to law.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof January, during the Consulate of
Protogenes and Astorius, 449.
9. The Emperor Anastasius to Theodore, Prsetorian Prefect.
Where a marriage has been dissolved by common consent, rather than by the
repudiation of the wife, and not on account of any cause included in the most
wise Constitution of the Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian of Divine Memory,
the woman shall not be required to wait for the expiration of the term of five
years, but can contract a second marriage after the lapse of one year.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof March, during the second Consulate of
the Emperor Anastasius, 497.
Extract from Novel 117, Chapter X. Latin Text.
At the present time, a divorce of this kind cannot take place except where the
husband and wife desire to live in chastity, and under such circumstances the
dowry, as well as the ante-nuptial donation, shall be preserved for the benefit
of the children. If, however, the parties subsequently contract another
marriage, or are found to be living in debauchery, their property shall be
delivered to their children, and they shall lose control of the same. In case
there are no children, it shall be forfeited to the Treasury. Those who are
guilty of such offences shall be subjected to the penalties prescribed by law.
10. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Pr&torian Prefect.
We add the following to the causes specifically enumerated by reason of which
repudiation can legally take place; namely, when a husband on account of
natural impotence is unable to have coition with his wife for two consecutive
years, from the beginning of the marriage, the wife, or her parents, can serve
notice of repudiation upon him, without risk of losing the dowry; provided,
however, that the ante-nuptial donation is preserved for the benefit of the
husband.1
1 The causes authorizing divorce in the different States of the Union are
almost innumerable. Few of them coincide, and with the exception of adultery,
not a single one is applicable everywhere. In addition to adultery, they
include

Lord Justinian, 528.
Extract from Novel 22, Chapter VI. Latin Text.
At the present day, We decree that instead of the term of two years, that of
three shall be reckoned from the time of cohabitation.
11. The Same to Hermogenes, Master of the Offices.
We order that where anyone has taken a wife with the consent of her parents,
or, if she had no parents, actuated by true marital affection, even if no dotal
instruments were drawn up, nor any dowry given, the marriage of the parties
shall be considered valid, just as if it had been accompanied with dotal
instruments; for marriages are not contracted by means of dowries but through
mutual attachment.
(1) When anyone desires to separate from a woman whom he married without a
dowry, he shall not be permitted to do so, unless some fault has been committed
which is condemned by Our laws. If, however, he should reject her without her
having been guilty of any fault, or he himself should commit such a fault
against an innocent woman, he shall be compelled to give her the fourth part of
his own property, in proportion to its amount; so that if he has an estate with
four hundred pounds of gold, or more, he must pay his wife a sum not exceeding
a hundred pounds of gold, and no more. If, however,
cruelty; insanity; failure to provide; ungovernable temper; desertion;
procuring of marriage by fraud or duress; conviction of felony; previous
divorce; sodomy; habitual drunkenness; notorious licentiousness of either party
before marriage; pre-marital pregnancy; concealment or contraction of venereal
disease; impotence, or sexual incapacity; existence of a former wife or
husband; lewd conduct of wife; attack by one party upon the other with
homicidal intent; disappearance without tidings for a specified term of years;
marriage within the degrees prohibited by law; refusal of the wife to change
her residence at the desire of the husband; violent behaviour rendering married
life intolerable; exclusion of the wife from the home; public defamation;
general disagreement; and gross neglect of duty, a provision of broad and ample
meaning, which of itself covers a multitude of marital sins.
Statistics show that within the last quarter of a century more than a half of a
million divorces have been obtained in this country. The so-called
"enfranchisement" of the sex, which is incompatible with home life and domestic
happiness, is mainly responsible for this condition, and by affording
opportunities that would have appeared incredible to the preceding generation,
has invested women with masculine qualities, enabled them to indulge their
predilection for dress to the point of extravagance, and facilitated indulgence
in dissipation of every kind, to the serious detriment of those distinguishing
characteristics and attributes which constitute the glory of the sex, and are
the chief source of its attractions. With the individuality of the husband,
formerly the head of the family, have disappeared the reserve, the gentleness,
the solicitude and the delicacy of the wife; instead of which we now have love
of notoriety, aspiration to public office, and the corruption and turmoil of
partisan politics. The physical nature of woman, utterly at variance with such
pursuits, the care of the household, the duties of maternity, are forgotten
amidst the homilies of the pulpit, the contests of the bar, the excitement of
electioneering, and the din of political controversy. The absolute unfitness of
the sex for these avocations is disclosed by the fact that no member of it has
ever become eminent in any profession, and few have even attained to
mediocrity.ED.
his estate should amount to less than four hundred pounds of gold, then, a
calculation having been made, the fourth part of his property shall be given to
the wife, as the smallest amount to which she is entitled.
The same rule should be observed with reference to women who have not been
endowed, and who have repudiated their husbands, without the fault of the
latter, and contrary to law; or where they themselves have given cause for
divorce to husbands who were innocent, so that, on both sides, justice and the
punishment may be equally administered.
The benefit of the aforesaid share of the property shall be enjoyed by the
husband or the wife where there are no children, and shall be disposed of by
them in any way which they may desire. When there are children or descendants
of the latter by the said marriage, the property shall in every respect be
preserved by them, just as in the case of a dowry or a donation in
consideration of marriage, as has been previously decided with reference to the
same.
(2) We add to the causes of divorce of husbands and wives already enumerated by
the laws, the following; namely, if the wife should by her own efforts produce
an abortion; or if she should be so lascivious as to dare, for the sake of
debauchery, to bathe with other men; or, while she is still married, attempt to
take another husband. In cases of this kind, We decree that the law shall apply
which treats of the guilt of both husband and wife, so, just as a dowry or a
donation made in consideration of marriage is lost, in like manner, women who
have not been endowed shall run the risk of losing the fourth part which, by
the terms of this law, We have destined for husbands and wives.
The Actio de moribus,which was formerly inserted in ancient laws, but which was
not often resorted to, is hereby absolutely abolished.
We decree that none of the former causes for divorce, which were requisite and
set forth in ancient laws, except those which have been confirmed by the
present enactment, and those which the latter has introduced, shall be valid.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof December, during the second Consulate of
Our Lord, the Emperor Justinian, 528.
TITLE XVIII.
IN WHAT WAY THE DOWRY CAN BE RECOVERED WHEN THE MARRIAGE HAS BEEN DISSOLVED.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Germilla.
After the dowry has been estimated, and an agreement or stipulation has been
entered into with reference to the same, there is no doubt that if the property
of which it is composed should be in existence at the time of the dissolution
of the marriage, it should be restored to the wife; and any female slaves,
together with their offspring,
which constitute part of the same, must also be returned by virtue of the
action based on the stipulation.
Given on the third of the Idesof April, under the Consulate of Lateranus and
Rufinus, 198.
2. The Same Emperors to Aquilia.
It is in accordance with the principle of the law that you think that your
dowry should be restored to you by the Treasury, which confiscated the property
of your father after his conviction. For although your father was the heir of
your former husband, still this cannot derogate from your rights, as your
father could neither exact nor receive your dowry without your consent.
Given on the day before the Nonesof April, during the Consulate of Aper and
Maximus, 208.
3. The Emperor Antoninus to Hostilia.
If, being ignorant of the condition of Eros, you married him and gave him a
dowry, as a freeman, and he afterwards was decided to be a slave, you can
recover your dowry out of his peculium,and anything else in addition which it
appears that he owes you. Your children, however, being born of a free woman,
but of a father whose status was uncertain, are understood to be illegitimate
freeborn children.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of Lsetus
and Cerealis, 216.
4. The Emperor Alexander to Apollonius.
The dowry provided by a father, where the woman dies in marriage while still
under paternal control, should be returned to him.
Given on the eighteenth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of
Fuscus and Dexter, 226.
5. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus, and the Csesar Valerian, to Taurus.
If your wife lives among enemies, her brother cannot yet, as her heir, claim
her dowry. If, however, she is dead, and he has a right to her estate, he can
also legally recover her dowry, as this was set forth in the stipulation.
Given on the second of the Nonesof May, during the Consulate of ^milianus and
Bassus, 360.
6. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Alexander and Nero.
If your mother has been deceived, and the dotal property has been appraised at
its true value, what has been decided with reference to a defect of this kind
in contracts is well known. Hence, if your mother has been misled as to the
appraisement of the dowry by the fraudulent artifices of her husband, and you
can prove this by conclusive evidence, before the Governor of the province, he
can, by his authority, grant you an exception on the ground of bad faith for
the purpose of obtaining the lands of which you are already in possession; and
he
will know to what extent to perform the duties of his judicial office. If,
however, after the truth has been ascertained, the husband should allege that
he has been injured by the appraisement, he cannot be compelled to return more
than the just price.
These rules apply when the property is in existence, but if it has been
destroyed, the sum stated in the dotal instrument must be adhered to.
Given on the eleventh of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
7. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Erotius.
You are not prohibited from depriving your daughter of money, if she is under
your control. Where, however, you have given her property as dowry, you cannot
do this during the existence of the marriage, if she does not give her consent;
nor, even after the marriage has been dissolved, can you claim the said
property if she is unwilling for you to do so.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof February, under the Consulate of the Csesars.
8. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Sallustia.
The husband (even though, after a divorce, he may have had judgment rendered
against him to the extent of his means) cannot refuse the payment of the
balance of the dowry, if he should after wards become solvent, provided he has
not already paid it in full. There is no doubt that his heirs can be sued for
the entire amount; and hence you, without good cause, apprehend that you cannot
bring suit against them, although they may be solvent.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
9. The Same Emperors and Caesars to Martia.
You should sue the heirs of your husband in an action of dowry to recover what
was given to him by way of dowry; but you have no right to take possession of
the dotal property without the authority of a competent court, if your
husband's heirs do not give their consent.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof November, under the Consulate of the
Csesars.
10. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Epigonus.
If you have given a dowry to the father-in-law of your daughter, although your
son-in-law may have died while under his father's control, the latter must
return the dowry to you, not merely to the extent of his son's peculium,but for
the entire amount, if you bring suit against him with the consent of your
daughter.
Given at Heraclea, on the seventh of the Idesof November, under the Consulate
of the Csesars.
11. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Marinianus, Praetorian Prefect.
When the husband dies during marriage, the dowry which is alleged to be given
or promised out of the property of the wife shall be returned to her, and the
heir of the deceased cannot claim for himself any of what the death of the
husband causes to revert to his wife.
Given at Ravenna, on the Nonesof December, during the Consulate of Honorius,
Consul for the eighth time, and Theodosius, Consul for the third time, 409.
TITLE XIX. WHERE A DOWRY HAS BEEN PAID DURING MARRIAGE.
1. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Marinianus, Prse-torian Prefect.
Where the dowry was illegally given by the husband to the wife, during marriage
(which cannot stand, because it is considered a donation), and the wife dies,
the property, together with the profits of the same from the day when the dowry
was bestowed, must be delivered to the husband by her heirs.
The ownership of the same, however, vests in the children of the wife, and
cannot be alienated by the husband, as this would be contrary to law.
Given on the fifth of the Nonesof November, during the Consulate of Honorius,
Consul for the eighth time, and Theodosius, Consul for the third time, 409.
TITLE XX.
NEITHER TRUSTEES NOR MANDATORS FOR DOWRIES SHALL BE APPOINTED.
1. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Cyne-gius, Praetorian
Prefect.
No matter whether the law providing that a husband shall furnish a surety for
the preservation of the dowry for his wife is derived from legal enactment, or
from custom, We direct that it shall be abolished.
Given on the eighth of the Nonesof September, during the Consulate of Eucherius
and Syagrius, 381.
2. The Emperor Justinian to Julian, Prsetorian Prefect.
For the purpose of extending the scope of the preceding constitution by a
general provision, We decree that no security or mandate with reference to a
dowry shall be exacted either from a husband or his father, or from any of
those who may have received it; for if the wife thought that she herself and
her dowry could be entrusted to her husband's father, why should a surety or
any other bondsman be
required, in order that reason for distrust might be introduced between the
parties during their marriage?
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof August, during the fifth Consulate of
Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
TITLE XXI. CONCERNING PROPERTY SURREPTITIOUSLY REMOVED.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Polydeuca.
It is with justice that you assert the right of set-off, for it is only
equitable that you should not be obliged to pay what it is established that you
owe before an answer has been made to your claim for money loaned; and there is
all the more reason for this, because you allege that you are demanding
property which you complain has been removed on account of divorce. Therefore,
after you have been sued under the stipulation before a competent judge, you
must prove to him that the property taken formed part of the dowry, and that it
was
yours.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate
of Alexander, Consul for the third time, and Dio, 230.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Serenus.
An action for the recovery of property which has been fraudulently removed is
granted by the Perpetual Edict; where, in case of divorce, it has been taken by
the husband from the wife, or by the wife from the husband. Still, while
marriage exists, neither a penal action nor one involving infamy will lie
against either of the parties, but an action in factumfor indemnity is granted.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors.
3. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Quartinus.
You are not prohibited from asserting ownership of the property which you
allege your former wife removed on account of the divorce, by bringing the
Actio perum amotarumagainst her successors, not, however, for the entire
amount, but only for as much of it as has come into their hands.
Given on the fifth of the Nonesof December, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors.
TITLE XXII.
THE ESTATE OF A HUSBAND CANNOT BE GIVEN TO A WOMAN INSTEAD OF HER DOWRY.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Apollinaria.It is prohibited by law
for the estate of a deceased husband to be given to his widow instead of dowry.
When, however, he died in-
solvent without leaving any heir, you will not be prevented from seeking
indemnification in accordance with the provisions of the law, to the extent
that the condition of the succession will permit.
Given on the fifth of the Nonesof December, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors.
TITLE XXIII. CONCERNING DOTAL LANDS.
1. The Emperor Severus and Antoninus to Didia.
Where lands which have been appraised are given by way of dowry, and the choice
of either the land or its value is reserved for the woman, the Lex Juliawill,
nevertheless, apply. Alienation is every act by means of which the ownership is
transferred.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Antoninus,
Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 213.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Domitia.
Husbands who have received as dowry land held in common with another, and which
has not been appraised, cannot bring suit in partition; although they
themselves can have an action of this kind brought against them.
Given on the fifth of the Nonesof October, during the Consulate of Gordian,
Consul for the second time, and Pompeianus, 242.
TITLE XXIV.
WITH WHOM CHILDREN SHOULD RESIDE OR BE BROUGHT UP, WHEN A DIVORCE HAS TAKEN
PLACE.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Celestina,
Although it has not been provided by any of Our Constitutions, or by any of
those of Our Divine Ancestors, that a division of children should be made among
parents according to sex, a competent judge must decide whether the children
shall live with, and be brought up by their father, or their mother, after the
marriage has been dissolved.
Given at Verona, on the seventh of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of
the Csesars.
Extract from Novel 117, Chapter VII. Latin Text.
Where the father has given cause for divorce, the children shall be brought up
by the mother at his expense, if she has not contracted a second marriage.
Where, on the other hand, the mother is to blame, then the children shall be
reared by the father at the expense of the mother, if she is wealthy; for when
he has not sufficient means to care for them, and she has, this duty devolves
upon her. For, just as
children who are rich are compelled to provide their mother with a livelihood,
if she is poor, so We decree that it is but just that children shall be
supported by their mother. We order that what has been stated concerning a
mother and children who are without means shall also be observed with reference
to all ascending and descending relatives of both sexes.
TITLE XXV.
CONCERNING THE SUPPORT OP CHILDREN AND RELATIVES IN THE ASCENDING LINE.
1. The Emperor Antoninus Pius to Bassus.
It is but just that children should relieve the necessities of their relatives
in the ascending line.
Without date, or designation of Consul.
2. The Divine Imperial Brothers to Celer.
A competent judge will order you to be supported by your son, if his means are
such that he can provide you with food.
Given on the Idesof April, during the Consulate of the same Emperors.
3. The Same Emperors to Titiana.
If you prove before a competent judge that the child which you allege was born
to you and Claudius is actually the son of the latter, he will order support to
be furnished him in accordance with the means of his father. The same judge
must decide whether the child shall be brought up by him.
Given at Rome, on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate
of Rusticus and Aquilinus.
4. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Sabinus.
If you have properly discharged the duties which you owe to your father, he
will not refuse you his paternal affection. If he should not do this
voluntarily, a competent judge, having been applied to, shall order him to
support you in proportion to his means. If, however, he denies that he is your
father, the same judge must, in the first place, investigate this point.
Given on the Nonesof February, during the Consulate of Lateranus
and Rufinus, 198.
TITLE XXVI. CONCERNING CONCUBINES.
1. The Emperor Constantine to the People.
Permission is given to no one to have a concubine in his house during marriage.
Given on the eighteenth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of the
Constantines, Father and Son, 321.
TITLE XXVII.
CONCERNING NATURAL CHILDREN AND THEIR MOTHERS, AND FOR WHAT REASONS THEY BECOME
LEGITIMATE.
1. The Emperor Constantine to Gregorius.
It is decided that Senators, or Prefects, and persons in the cities who have
been invested with the dignity of duumvirs, or with that of the priesthood
(that is to say, such as are attached to the government of Phoenicia or Syria),
shall be branded with infamy, and excluded from the protection of the Roman
law, if they give their consent to place among the number of legitimate persons
either the children of female slaves, or the daughter of a female slave; or a
freedwoman, or her daughter; or a public actress, or her daughter; or the
daughter of a tavern-keeper, or her daughter; or the offspring of anyone of low
and degraded social position; or the daughter of a procurer, or of a gladiator;
or that of a woman publicly engaged in business as a merchant; whether they do
this by their, own authority or by that of one of Our Rescripts. In case a
father should give anything to such children (whether he states that they are
legitimate or natural), it shall be taken from them, and delivered to his
lawful offspring, or to his brother, his sister, his father, or his mother. If
anything should in any way be bestowed upon a wife of this kind, or even
transferred to her by way of sale, We order that it shall be taken from her and
given to those legally entitled to it.
We also order that those women with whose poison the minds of ruined persons
are affected shall be subjected to torture; and if anything is demanded of
them, or is said to have been entrusted to them, it shall be restored to those
whom We have mentioned, or confiscated to Our Treasury. Therefore, whether the
donation was made either by him who is alleged to be the father, or by someone
else, or by an individual introduced for that purpose, or whether the property
has been purchased by him or by another, or in the names of the children
themselves, it shall immediately be restored to those whom We have designated;
and if no such persons are in existence, it shall be legally claimed by the
Treasury.
Where, however, such persons exist, and, with the property before them, decline
to act, they having been excluded either by agreement or by oath, the Treasury
shall take possession of all such said property without delay. When they remain
silent, or are guilty of dissimulation, the time for offering a defence to the
Treasury shall be limited to two months, within which period, if they do not
assert their claim, or apply to the Governor of the province for that purpose,
whatever an illegal generosity may have bestowed upon such children or wives
shall be seized by Our Treasury, which shall demand any such property which has
been donated or entrusted to them, under the severe penalty of quadruple
damages.
Given at Carthage, on the twelfth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate
of Nepotian and Facundus, 336.
Extract from Novel 127, Chapter IV. Latin Text.
By a new law, however, such women can contract marriage with men of every
description, even where they are incumbents of the aforesaid offices, provided
dotal instruments are executed for this purpose by persons of illustrious rank.
All others, with the exception of those who are invested with the highest
dignities, can contract marriage through affection alone, provided the women
with whom it is lawful for them to contract marriage are free.
2. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Antemonius, Praetorian Prefect.
Where the mother, or any legitimate children, grandchildren, or great-
grandchildren of either sex, to the number of one or more, are living, a father
can only give or leave one-twelfth of his estate to his natural sons or
daughters, or to their mother; or if only his concubine is living, he is
authorized to give or bequeath to her one-twelfth of his estate. Anything which
may be left beyond the amount prescribed by law shall go to his legitimate
children, or to their mother, or to his other heirs.
Given on the Idesof November, under the Consulate of Stilicho, Consul for the
second time, and Anthemius, 405.
Extract from Novel 89, Chapter XII. Latin Text.
At present, only natural and legitimate children are subject to this
limitation. This is not the case with the mother.
3. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Apollonius, Prse-torian Prefect.
Where anyone has only natural children, whether he himself is free, or bound by
the restrictions of the curia,and he prefers to transfer his natural children
wholly or in part to the curiaof the city from which he himself derived his
origin, We grant him the power to do so, and to appoint them heirs to his
entire estate. If, however, a person who is not the native of a city but of a
village, or was born upon any tract of land whatsoever, should have natural
children, and desires them to be benefited by the honorable distinction of the
curia,as foresaid, and profit by their father's estate, they should be attached
to the city within whose jurisdiction the village or farm, which was the
birthplace of the father, is considered to be. But where the father claims as
his birthplace either of the two Imperial Cities, he shall be entitled to place
his children born out of wedlock among the decurions of either of them,
provided the one which he may select has jurisdiction over the entire province;
for it is disgraceful for anyone who boasts of being a native of a most Holy
City not to be able to give his natural children the benefit of a residence in
it; and this disposition the father can either make for the benefit of his
natural children by his last will, or by a donation of any amount whatsoever.
And what We have desired to be observed with reference to the rank of decurion,
whether it be conferred by will or by any other legal
document, We decree shall be observed as valid and established; so that if the
children abstain from accepting the estate, or reject the donations, and wish
to avoid the condition of decurion, and are afterwards found to be in
possession of the estate of their father, either wholly or in part, they shall,
by all means, be compelled to accept the position which their father desired
them to occupy with his wealth, even though they may have alienated the
property, and are unwilling to discharge the duties of the office.
Where, however, the father has a natural daughter or daughters, and disposes of
her or them in marriage to the decurions of the city in which he was born, or
upon which the village or farm where he derived his origin is dependent, or of
that city which has jurisdiction over the entire province, these regulations
shall, so far as the said children are concerned, apply, as in the case of a
husband. For what difference does it make whether cities are benefited by means
of sons or sons-in-law, or whether the law creates new decurions, or favors
those already in existence?
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of Eudoxius
and Dioscorus, 442.
4. The Emperors Leo and Anthemius to Armasius, Prsetorian Prefect.
As, not without good reason, We ascertain the desires of the dying from the
opinions of the living, so, where anyone, having a natural son, desires to have
him invested with the office of decurion for the purpose of making him
legitimate, and rendering him a citizen of his birthplace, he shows
unquestionably that, induced by paternal affection, he has selected him as the
successor to his entire estate. A person of this kind cannot, by virtue of the
Imperial Constitutions, be granted the power either of alienating or rejecting
the estate or donation of his father, for the purpose of defrauding the
curia;but he shall be compelled to accept the duties imposed upon him by the
will of his father; and We do not suffer that, in any way whatsoever, the
claims of calumnious persons shall be admitted, contrary to Our present
regulations; but We order that Philocalus himself, the heir at law of the
entire estate of his father, and attached to the curiaof Our city, shall
perform the duties which have been, or should be enjoined upon him; and that
any children whom he may now have, or who may hereafter be born to him, shall
likewise be subject to the condition imposed by his father.
We decree that this rule shall hereafter be observed in all cases which may
hereafter occur, no matter in what Order or curiaof any city.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Jordanus and Severus, 470.
5. The Emperor Zeno to Sebastian, Prsetorian Prefect.Renewing the most Sacred
Constitution of the Divine Constantine, who provided the Roman Empire with the
revered faith of the Chris-
tians, which Constitution had reference to the taking as concubines of freeborn
married women, and stated that any children born to them either before or after
marriage should be considered legitimate, We order that if those who, before
the promulgation of this law, had, without the ceremony of marriage, lived in
concubinage with freeborn women, and had children of either sex by them; the
latter shall not be considered legitimate, for the reason that their mothers
were not their father's wives. If, however, they should desire to marry the
women who were formerly their concubines, they can contract lawful matrimony
with freeborn women of this description, as previously stated; and the children
of both sexes begotten of the former union with the same women shall,
immediately after the marriage with their mothers has been celebrated, become
legitimate, and be under the control of their fathers, and shall succeed to the
entire estates of the latter along with those who may afterwards be begotten
during the said marriages, or alone; and, if no child should afterwards be
born, they can claim their estates not only under the last will of their
fathers, but also as heirs at law. And so far as any agreements which may have
been entered into during marriage with reference to dowries or ante-nuptial
donations, in which they themselves are interested are concerned, they shall,
none the less, be entitled to the benefit of the same, either alone (if no
other child has been begotten) or along with their brothers born to the same
parents, in accordance with the provisions of the laws.
Those, however, who, up to the time of the promulgation of this most Sacred
Decree, have had no issue by freeborn concubines, shall, by no means, enjoy the
benefit of this law; for as they are permitted to unite themselves in matrimony
with these women, when there are no free children or wives living, they can, by
marrying said women, beget lawful offspring; and persons who have had issue by
freeborn concubines, but have neglected to marry them after the promulgation of
this law, must not presume to urgently demand that their children shall
hereafter be considered legitimate.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Basilius,
Consul for the second time, and Armatius, 476.
6. The Emperor Anastasius to Sergius, Prsetoria/n Prefect.
We order that those who have no legitimate children living, and who at the
present time are keeping women instead of wives, shall consider any issue born
to them to be legitimate, and subject to their control; and that they can
transfer to them their private property by their last wills, by donations, or
by any other method recognized by law, if they should desire to do so.
We also decree that the said children shall be entitled to succeed to the
estates of their fathers, and that neither the agnates nor cognates of the
latter, nor anyone else, shall hereafter have the right .to raise any question
or dispute, by availing themselves of the subtleties of the laws or
constitutions, for the purpose of depriving them of the succession.
Nevertheless, where anyone keeps a woman of this
kind as a wife, and dotal instruments have been executed, the same rule shall
be observed with reference to his offspring, in order that, in no way, he may
be deprived of acquiring his own patrimony by means of his children.
In addition to this, We decree that any children who have, by virtue of
Imperial Rescripts, been arrogated by their fathers, shall enjoy the benefit
and assistance of this Our most salutary law.
Given on the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Anastasius, Consul for
the fourth time, and Agapitus, 508.
7. The Emperor Justin to Marinus, Prsetorian Prefect.
We decree that the law of Anastasius, of Divine memory, which was promulgated
with reference to natural children, shall only be valid in those cases which,
up to this time, have come under the terms of the same law with reference to
the marriages then existing, or which have subsequently been contracted;
provided, however, that it shall not be held to benefit children born of a
wicked or incestuous union. Moreover, We have decided, not without reason, that
relief should be afforded to children of both sexes who, not the issue of an
incestuous or wicked marriage, have, through the efforts of some woman, been
arrogated or adopted by virtue of an Imperial Rescript, whether before the said
law was promulgated, or afterwards, up to the present time; so that said
adoption or arrogation may be valid, and no question may be raised alleging
that what the parties have obtained was forbidden by some law; as mercy
dictates that, if any doubt on this point should arise, it ought not to be
entertained, for the reason that those who suffer from the faults of others are
not to blame. Therefore, children of this kind, after arrogation or adoption,
come under the control of their fathers, and are entitled to succeed to their
estates, not only as heirs at law, but also under a will.
Moreover, all persons are hereby notified that lawful posterity can only be
sought in legal marriage, just as if the above-mentioned Constitution had not
been published, for hereafter no excuse can be alleged for the unlawful desires
of libertinage. No encouragement shall be given for this purpose beyond what is
provided by the ancient laws, nor shall dependence any longer be placed upon
the aforesaid Constitution which Our pious judgment declares shall be repealed
from this day; nor shall the pretext of arrogation or adoption be advanced, as
these will no longer be tolerated; nor shall any subtleties or claims based
upon Imperial Rescripts be made use of, nor any dependence be placed upon
unlawful schemes; for it is extremely unworthy as well as wicked to demand
protection for vices in order that persons may be permitted to indulge their
wantonness, and claim for themselves, under color of law, the rights and name
of father which are legally denied them.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof November, during the Consulate of Justinus and
Euthericus, 519.
8. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Prsetorian Prefect.
On the ground of humanity, We grant permission to the fathers of natural
children, when they have no legitimate offspring, or their mother is living, to
appoint their said natural child or children their heirs, not only to three-
twelfths of their estates (which former laws sanctioned), but to half, that is
to say, six-twelfths of the same. So that, although they have no claim as heirs
at law to the estate of their natural father, permission is given to them to
take by his last will as aforesaid six-twelfths of the same, if their natural
father is willing for them to do so; provided, however, that the testator does
not, under any circumstances, exceed the above-mentioned amount of six-
twelfths, in making bequests to all his natural children and their mother.
We also grant the natural father free permission to bequeath his estate to the
amount of six-twelfths, in legacies and trusts, as well as in dowries and
donations to his children begotten before marriage.
These provisions only apply to wills, bequests, dowries, and donations to be
given or made hereafter.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof January, during the second Consulate
of Our Lord, the Emperor Justinian, 528.
Extract from, Novel 89, Chapters XII, and XV. Latin Text.
A father who dies without leaving any children, or relatives in the ascending
line, to whom he would be required to bequeath his estate, can either transfer
all of it to his natural children by will, or can give it to them by a donation
inter vivos.Where only relatives in the ascending line survive him, he is
permitted, after leaving them the share to which they are legally entitled, to
distribute the remainder among his natural children. If, however, he leaves no
legitimate offspring, and is not survived by a lawful wife, and dies intestate,
but has natural children by a concubine, who was united to him solely by
undoubted affection, the said children shall succeed to two-twelfths of their
father's estate, and their mother shall receive her legitimate share of the
same, if she is living. For whether there are any surviving legitimate children
or not, or whether there are other heirs, and the wife is living, it is
necessary for natural children of this kind to be supported in accordance with
the judgment of a good citizen. Hence such children are required to furnish the
same service to their parents, if there is need of it; but those who are born
of an unlawful connection are excluded from all benefits whatever.
9. The Same to Menna, Prsetorian Prefect.
We, very properly being of the opinion that the public welfare demands that the
subjects of Our Empire should be governed by laws which are clear and free from
all ambiguity, do promulgate the following decree, by which all doubt
prevailing up to the present time having been removed, We establish it as
certain that, whenever natural children are assigned to the curiaof the
domicile of their father, during the lifetime of the latter, or even after his
death, they, in this manner, acquire a legitimate right to his estate; so that
(as is mani-
festly entirely just), even though the said natural children may have
previously attained to some illustrious dignity by which the condition of
decurion cannot be effaced, they shall not be permitted to claim for themselves
any rights to the estates of the ascendants or descendants of their said
natural father, or of any of his agnates or cognates through their relationship
to him; although they themselves, on account of the above-mentioned attachment
to the curia,become the lawful heirs of their natural father.
These provisions apply to those who have already been assigned by their natural
fathers to the condition of decurion, and are still living; and, in like
manner, none of the legitimate descendants, ascendants, or collateral relatives
can legally claim anything for themselves out of the estates of the said
natural children. Where, however, a natural child of this kind, having
subsequently been made the lawful heir of his father, whether he has children
formerly born in lawful marriage or has other issue descended from him, they
shall, by all means, be called to his succession without the execution of a
will by the deceased, and the rule relating to the curiashall not apply; but if
a fourth part of the estate should be due to the curia,none of the children of
the deceased can be compelled to discharge the duties of decurion. The rule
that any children which the said natural son may beget after he has been
assigned to the curia,will undoubtedly be born decurions, and be compelled to
discharge the duties of that office, must be observed.
(1) If, however, the decurion should die without leaving any children, and only
the mother should survive, she will be entitled to the third part of his
estate, and the curia,to whom the father has been attached shall have the other
two-thirds. If, however, the mother of the deceased should not be living,
others of her cognates, either of the descending or ascending lines, or in the
collateral line, shall be called to her succession; and then whatever property
came into the hands of the deceased through his natural father shall belong to
the same curia.But where, after a natural son has been rendered a lawful heir,
he has acquired anything from his mother, or from any other legitimate source,
this shall go to the nearest maternal cognates of the deceased.
The following rule must, however, be observed; namely, whether the mother is
living, or whether she died before her son, if anyone of the same family is
ready to attach himself to the same curia,,he will be permitted to receive the
property of the deceased which came into his hands from his father's estate,
and he shall discharge the duties of decurion; and when this takes place, the
mother of the deceased, if she is still living, shall not only be entitled to
the third part of the property which her son has acquired from other sources
than his father's estate, but she shall also receive all the property which
she, as sole heir, is entitled to, or she shall share the same with her
coheirs, if any there be.
(2) The rules which We have established with reference to the succession of a
natural son who dies after having obtained the position
of decurion, not only shall apply to those who were assigned to the curiaby
their natural father, but also to such as have previously been assigned to it,
if they are still living. Where, however, they have died before the
promulgation of the present law, We do not include their succession in its
provisions.
(3) And, since the curiasof cities should, by all means, be favored, We order
that the following shall be added to what has preceded it, namely, that it
shall be lawful for fathers to attach their natural sons to the curiseof their
places of residence, not only where they have no lawful children living, but
also where they have any sons or other descendants by a lawful marriage, and
that by this means their natural children shall also become their lawful
successors; provided, however, that they shall, by no means, be permitted to
give or leave either by donation or by last will to a natural child any more
than they may have given or left to a child born in lawful marriage, to whom
the smallest share has been either donated or bequeathed.
Given on the Kalendsof June, during the second Consulate of Our Lord Justinian,
528.
10. The Same to Demosthenes, Prsetorian Prefect.
Where anyone has lived for a time in the pleasant society of a free woman with
whom marriage is not forbidden by the laws, and has children by her, without
any dotal instruments having been drawn up, and afterwards, induced by the same
affection, he marries her, and begets other children after the marriage, in
order to prevent the latter, being legitimate and under his control, from
claiming for themselves the entire estate of their father, thereby excluding
their brothers, who were born before the marriage, from sharing in the estate,
We decree that injustice of this kind shall not be tolerated. For as affection
for the first offspring was instrumental in bringing about the marriage, and
gave occasion to the birth of the more recent children, why is it not most
inequitable for the offspring born after marriage to exclude the others, when
the former should be grateful to their brothers through whose means they
themselves have become legitimate, and have obtained the name and standing of
children of this description? For it is not probable that the man who
afterwards made a donation, or gave a dowry to a woman of this kind, did not
from the beginning entertain for her sufficient affection to consider her
worthy of being his wife. Wherefore, We decree that in such cases all children,
whether they have been born before marriage or subsequently, shall be equal in
every respect; that all those belonging to the father shall be held to be under
his control; and that no distinction shall exist between the former and the
latter, but that all who are the issue of the same marriage shall enjoy similar
advantages.
Given at Chalcedon, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof October, during the
Consulate of Decius, 529.
11. The Same to Julian, Prsetorian Prefect.
We formerly promulgated a law by which We ordered that if anyone should live
with a woman without having for her the attachment
of a husband from the beginning (provided she was one with whom lawful marriage
could be contracted), and he should have children by her, and afterwards,
induced by affection, should marry her, and have other sons and daughters by
her, not only the second children who were born after marriage shall be
legitimate, and under paternal control, but also those previously born, who
have afforded those who came into the world subsequently the opportunity of
obtaining legitimacy.
Certain authorities have held that this law should be interpreted in such a way
that if any children were born after the marriage, or even if there were some
who had died, those born previously should not be considered legitimate, unless
the children born under these different conditions should be living at the same
time. We decree that excessive subtlety of this description shall be absolutely
disregarded, as it is sufficient for a man to have sufficient affection after
the birth of children to induce him to execute an instrument of marriage with
the hope of having others. For even though what was hoped for may not have
taken place, an accidental circumstance should, by no means, be conceded to
derogate from the rights of children previously born. Where anyone has been
living with a woman and causes her to become pregnant, and subsequently, while
she is still in this condition, enters into a contract of marriage with her,
and a boy or girl is born, a much better reason exists that this offspring
should be the legal issue of the father, be brought under his control, and be
his heir in case of his death, whether he dies testate or intestate. For it
would be extremely absurd if children born after marriage should confer the
benefit of legitimacy upon others previously born, and that a boy or girl of
this kind could not secure this advantage for themselves.
And, generally speaking, with reference to the various opinions given in such
cases, We decree, and include in a definite provision -that, always, under such
circumstances, where any doubt exists as to the status of children, the time of
their birth, and not that of their conception, should be taken into account.
This We do in order to favor children by providing that the date of birth
should be considered, except in those instances in which the welfare of infants
demands that the time of conception should rather be noted.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof April, during the fifth Consulate of
Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
Extract from Novel 12, Chapter III. Latin Text.
This rule shall also apply where a father, previous to this union, had
legitimate children by another wife from whom he has been legally separated, or
where she is dead.
Extract from Novel 18, Last Chapter. Latin Text.
Anew constitution, however, does not permit this rule to apply to the case of a
female slave, unless where a man has no other children who are legitimate.
Extract from Novel 78, Chapter HI. Latin Text.
Another new constitution is considered generally to provide with regard to the
children of a female slave that, by the sole fact of the bestowal of a dowry,
she, as well as her offspring, will receive their freedom.
Extract from Novel 74- Latin Text.
Moreover, anyone who has no legitimate offspring, but only natural children the
issue of a union of this description, can, by presenting a petition to the
Emperor, render them legitimate, even without marriage, if the woman is already
dead, or if she has left him, or remains concealed, or for any other reason is
prevented from appearing, or where some impediment to matrimony exists, as for
instance, the priesthood.
Extract from Novel 74, Chapter II. Latin Text.
Likewise, where a man dies without leaving legitimate offspring, and states in
his will that he wishes his natural children to be his lawful heirs, he shall
be permitted to do this, so that, after his death, the said children may
petition the Emperor, and, after having produced the will, they can become the
heirs through the indulgence of the sovereign and the law, provided they carry
out the provisions of their father's will. This rule shall generally be
observed. If, however, some of them desire to become legitimate, and others do
not, the wishes of the first shall be granted, and the others shall remain in
their condition of natural children.
Extract from Novel 13, Chapter II. Latin Text.
Where anyone who has natural children by a free woman capable of being his wife
who states either in a public document or in one drawn up in his own hand and
subscribed by three witnesses worthy of confidence, or says in his will or in
any instrument, that such-and-such children are his, and does not use the term
"natural," offspring of this kind shall be his lawful heirs; and if, to any one
of the said children, he should make a statement in the manner above mentioned,
it will be sufficient to confer the rights of legitimacy upon all others born
of the same woman.
12. The Same-to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
A man, who had a legitimate son, had a natural grandson by the latter, and the
question arose whether the name of grandson could legally be given to a child
of this kind, for the grandfather desired to leave his entire estate to this
grandson, his legitimate son, the father of the latter, having died; as it was
only prohibited by the Sacred Constitutions that the entire inheritance, or
such a part as 'he desired to leave them, should be left to natural children,
and at .the same time their interest was limited to a certain amount.
A doubt of this kind gives rise to another, for what would be the case where a
grandfather has either a legitimate grandson or a
natural grandson by a natural son? Hence, as in all ambiguous questions of this
kind, no definite conclusion can be arrived at with reference to such persons,
and by the introduction of natural offspring no legal right can arise; to the
end that the necessity of leaving something to them may be provided for by the
laws, they shall be permitted to bestow upon these descendants as much of their
estates as they may desire (of course, where there is no legitimate issue
living). For the Imperial Constitutions prohibited that as much should be left
to natural children as their parents might desire to give them, because they
considered that, by so doing, the debauchery of their fathers could be
restrained.
With reference to grandchildren, however, the rule in the instance above
mentioned should not be observed, where there is no legitimate offspring to
offer an impediment. But where such offspring exists, We extend the provisions
of the ancient constitutions, which have been established concerning natural
sons, to grandsons, as well; but We decree that they shall only apply to those
who can obtain a share in their grandfather's estate by virtue of his will, for
We do not allow any of them to become his heirs at law.
We decree that they shall not only have the benefit of the estate of their
natural paternal grandfather, but also those of their greatgrandfather, and of
his cognates; if anyone should desire to apply this term to men of such
degenerate character.
Given during the Kalendsof November, during the fifth Consulate of Lampadius
and Orestes, 530.
TITLE XXVIII. CONCERNING TESTAMENTARY GUARDIANSHIP.
1. The Emperor Severus and Antoninus to Sperata.
The person whom you state was appointed guardian for you by the will of your
patroness is not liable to you in any action, if he did not interfere in the
administration of the guardianship, for he was not legally appointed your
guardian. Where, however, he, of his own accord, transacted your business, you
can proceed against him in an action based on voluntary agency.
Given on the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Asper and Maximus, 208.
2. The Emperor Antoninus to Sabinianus.
Although the guardian who was legally appointed for you by your father's will
was living at the time when you became his heir, still, as another was also
legally appointed for you by a codicil, both of-them will be your guardians
under the will of the testator; unless your father revoked the testamentary
appointment by designating the other mentioned in the codicil, for then the
latter alone will be your guardian.
Given on the Idesof April, under the Consulate of the Aspers, 213.
3. The Emperor Alexander to Gordius and Others.
Where testamentary guardians are appointed for you, even though one of you may
have attained his majority, that is to say, have passed the period of tutelage,
your guardianship will not belong
to him.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and Julianus, 224.
4. The Same to Feliciana.
A mother cannot appoint guardians for her children unless she has made them her
heirs. However, when she has not designated them as her heirs, it is customary
for the testamentary guardian to be confirmed by the Governor. Where, however,
none of these things take place, and the testamentary guardians have
administered the affairs of the trust, they will be liable in an action of
guardianship.
Given on the seventh of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of Julian,
Consul for the second time, and Crispinus, 225.
5. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus to Daphna.
If the father of certain minors desired that a slave belonging to another, with
reference to whom you petition, should become the guardian of said minors, and
be free, another guardian previously appointed retaining his office in the
meantime, it will be necessary for the said slave to be purchased and
manumitted in the presence of the Governor, and be added to the administration
as curator.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Secularis
and Donatus, 261.
6. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Domna.
If your father legally appointed your uncle your guardian by will, and he was
not excused, an action of guardianship can be brought against him, not only
with reference to the affairs which he administered, but also on account of
what he neglected (and which he Should have administered), before a competent
judge, who shall order that satisfaction be given you in accordance with good
faith.
Given on the Nonesof April, during the Consulate of the CaBsars.
7. The Same, and the Csesars, to Triphena.
As you intend to proceed in an action against the guardian appointed for you by
the will of your father, under whose control you were, a competent judge,
having been applied to, will order anything due to you to be paid; for there is
no doubt that a curator cannot be appointed by will.
Given on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
8. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Florentius, Prse-torian Prefect.
It is legal for testamentary guardians to be appointed in the Greek language,
so that those appointed in this manner may be
considered to have been appointed by the testator in terms authorized by law.
Given on the day before the Idesof September, during the Consulate of
Theodosius, Consul for the fourteenth time, and Maximus, 439.
TITLE XXIX. CONCERNING THE CONFIRMATION OF A GUARDIAN.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Prisons.
Guardians appointed by the will of the mother have no reason to be excused,
unless, after proper examination, they are found to have also been appointed by
a decree in accordance with the will of the deceased.
Given on the third of the Nonesof March, during the Consulate of Julian, Consul
for the second time, and Crispinus, 225.
2. The Same to Valerius.
There is no doubt that a guardian cannot legally be appointed either by a
letter, or by an imperfect testament, but the wishes of the father with
reference to the appointment of guardians or curators, in cases of this kind,
is accustomed to be observed by the judge who has jurisdiction of such matters.
In accordance with which, you should be under no apprehension that the
prescribed time has expired before you have been confirmed.
Given on the eighth of the Idesof August, during the Consulate of Alexander,
Consul for the second time, and Marcellus, 217.
3. The Same to Sossianus, Prsetorian Prefect.
If (as you allege) your father illegally appointed testamentary guardians for
the minor whom you have mentioned, and that, before they were confirmed, others
were also appointed by someone who" had the right to do so, what was properly
done by law cannot be revoked; but a competent judge, having been applied to,
will decide, in accordance with the welfare of the minor, whether the guardians
appointed by the will of the father should be appointed his curators.
Given on the third of the Idesof April, during the Consulate of Modestus and
Probus, 229.
4. The Emperor Justinian to Julian, Prsetorian Prefect.
With a view to providing for the welfare of natural children, We grant
permission to their fathers to appoint guardians for them, to insure the
administration of such property as they may have given or bequeathed them in
any manner whatsoever; provided this is done within the limits prescribed by
Our laws, and the said guardians are confirmed by a competent judge, and then
administer the affairs of the guardianship.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof April, during the
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
TITLE XXX. CONCERNING LEGAL GUARDIANSHIPS.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Firmina.
The guardianship of males is not granted to maternal uncles by the Laws of the
Twelve Tables, but this right is accorded to paternal uncles if they are not
excused.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of Diocletian,
Consul for the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third time, 290.
Extract from Novel 118, Chapter V. Latin Text.
As the right of inheritance is conceded to relatives without taking agnation
into account, so also is the burden and benefit of guardianship granted to
relatives, provided they are of the male sex and of full age, and are not
forbidden by any law to undertake it. Where, however, there are several
relatives of the same degree, and they are called to the guardianship, We order
that, when one or more of them is present in court, a choice shall be made. The
guardianship should be committed to him or them who are the best qualified to
attend to it; responsibility attaching to all called to its administration and
their property being tacitly encumbered to their wards to secure the proper
management of the trust.
2. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Asclepiodotus.
It is perfectly clear that the administration of guardianship legally belongs
to the agnates of the minor, unless they have undergone a change of condition.
Given on the third of the Nonesof April, during the Consulate of the same
Emperors.
3. The Emperor Leo to Erythrius, Prsetorian Prefect.
The Lex Claudiahaving been abrogated by a Constitution of the Emperor
Constantine, of Divine Memory, and the right of agnation remaining unimpaired
by virtue of the authority of the ancient law, the blood-relatives, that is to
say, the brother, as well as the paternal uncle and the other kindred legally
authorized, are called to the guardianship of females.
Given on the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Martian and Zeno, 469.
4. The Emperor Anastasius to Polycarp, Prsetorian Prefect.
An emancipated man who, by Our present law, in the succession to his brother's
or sister's estate is ordered to take precedence of all other cognates and
agnates of inferior or more distant relationship, shall also be called to the
legal guardianship of his brothers and sisters, as well as to that of their
children, although he has been liberated from the control of his father by
emancipation, unless he can avail
himself of some other excuse provided by law; for We are not willing for him to
claim that under this pretext he is released from the administration of the
guardianship.
Given on the Kalendsof April, under the Consulate of John and Paulinus, 498.
5. The Emperor Justinian to Demosthenes, Praetorian Prefect.
No brother, nor any other relative authorized by law, shall be called to the
guardianship of either a freeborn person or a freedman before he has completed
his twenty-fifth year; for each person must be liable only for his own
administration, to prevent one from being burdened with the charges of another.
For in this way both minors and adults will be subjected to proper
guardianship, and the natural order will be reserved in every respect. How can
it be tolerated that anyone should be a guardian, and at the same time subject
to guardianship, or that the same individual should be a curator, while he
himself is under tutelage? This is indeed an abominable confusion of names and
things. All these matters are distinct, and testamentary or legal guardians or
curators must be of such an age as to be competent for the management of their
own affairs, and have all their property liable to hypothecation.
All those provisions which have been established by former laws with reference
to the succession of freeborn persons, as well as freedmen, shall remain in
full force, and shall not, in any way, be demin-ished in efficiency by the
operation of the present law; and this particularly applies to the inheritances
of freedmen, in order that they may not appear to lose the advantage of
succession, for the reason that they do not assume the burden of guardianship.
Read seven times in the new Consistory of the Palace of Justinian.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof November, during the fifth Consulate of
Decius, 539.
TITLE XXXI.
CONCERNING THOSE WHO DEMAND GUARDIANS OR CURATORS.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Chrysantha.
Notify the young man against whom you wish to appear to demand that curators be
appointed for himself, with whom you can confer in accordance with the forms of
law. If, however, he should not make this demand, you can apply to a competent
judge, and he must perform his duty, and appoint curators.
Given on the second of the Nonesof February, during the Consulate of Messala
and Sabinus, 215.
2. The Same to Epaphroditus.
If your patron's children are of such an age that their affairs should be
administered by guardians, be sure to appear before the
Praetor, and give him the names of those for whom guardians ought to be
appointed; and if you fail to do so, you will run the risk of being punished
for your neglect of duty to your patron.
Given on the Nonesof July, during the Consulate of Messala and Sabinus, 215.
3. The Same to Atalanta.
Ask a competent judge to appoint a capable guardian for your children, who is a
resident of the same province, instead of the one that is deceased, or has been
banished for life, who, in accordance with his duty, will provide for their
welfare.
Given on the fourth of the Idesof July, during the Consulate of Lsetus, Consul
for the second time, and Cerealis, 216.
4. The Same to Domninus.
If there are no near relatives who can demand that guardians be appointed for
the children of your debtor, you yourself can take measures for that purpose,
in order that the said children may be legally defended.
Given on the third of the Idesof July, during the Consulate of Lsetus, Consul
for the second time, and Cerealis, 216.
5. The Emperor Alexander to Fusciana.
A maternal aunt is not forbidden to petition for guardians to be appointed for
the children of her brother.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and Julianus, 224.
6. The Same to Otacilia.
Maternal affection will suggest to you whom you should ask to have appointed
guardians for your son, and it should also induce you to see that nothing but
what is proper is done in the administration of the affairs of your minor
child. However, the necessity of demanding curators for their sons is not
imposed upon mothers, as minors who have arrived at puberty, but are under
twenty-five years of age, can petition to have curators appointed for
themselves, if their affairs
require it.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of Julian,
Consul for the second time, and Crispinus, 225.
7. The Emperor Gordian to Dionysius.
Notify her, who was formerly your ward, to ask that a curator be appointed for
herself, as she has not yet arrived at puberty, and you intend to give her in
marriage. If she should neglect to do this, you will not be prevented from
demanding a curator before a judge having jurisdiction of such matters, in
order that you may be able the more readily to render an account of your
administration.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof January, during the Consulship of Gordian and
Aviola, 240.
8. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Musicus.
As the positive duty of demanding guardians for their children is imposed upon
mothers who are not to be held liable for fortuitous occurrences, and you state
that an attorney who was appointed by the mother for the purpose of applying
for a guardian for her minor son was killed by robbers, and the demand was
postponed on account of this accident, it would be exceedingly unjust for the
mother to be excluded from the succession of the estate of her son, as you
assert that she was in no way responsible for the delay.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Tiberian and
Dio, 291.
9. The Same Emperors to Asclepiodotus.
As a guardian cannot be appointed for a person who already has one, you will
understand that the mother has not neglected her duty as a parent, in demanding
the appointment, but that she cannot reasonably ask that a guardian be
appointed where her son has already been legally provided with one.
Given at Byzantium, on the third of the Nonesof April, under the Consulate of
the same Emperors.
10. The Same Emperors and Csssars to Prisons.
You can formally petition for guardians to be appointed for the grandsons of
your brother, if their mother does not perform her duty by making such an
application.
Given on the day before the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of the Caesars.
11. The Emperor Zeno to Dioscorus, Prsetorian Prefect.
Mothers shall be subjected to the necessity of demanding the appointment of
guardians for their natural children, just as in the case of those who are born
in lawful wedlock, and neither ignorance of the law, nor its assumption for the
purpose of evading the Imperial Constitutions, will profit them, if they should
fail to apply for such an appointment.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of
Zeno, Consul for the second time, 479.
TITLE XXXII.
WHERE A PETITION MUST BE MADE FOE THE APPOINTMENT OF GUARDIANS OR CURATORS.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Aristobula.
The magistrates of the town from which your children derive their origin
through their father, or where their property is situated, must see that
guardians or curators are appointed for them at once, in accordance with the
provisions of the law. If, however, your children do not possess any property
in the province where they reside, and do
not derive their paternal origin therefrom, they must return to their own
country, or the place where their patrimony is situated, and establish their
residence there, and legal defenders will, then be appointed for them.
Given on the Kalendsof October, during the Consulship of Lsetus, Consul for the
second time, and Cerealis, 216.
TITLE XXXIII.
CONCERNING THE GUARDIANS AND CURATORS OF ILLUSTRIOUS OR DISTINGUISHED PERSONS.
1. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius, to Proculus, Prefect of
the City.
Let the Prefect of the City, after having associated with himself ten men taken
from among the senators, together with the distinguished Praetor, who has
jurisdiction over matters relating to guardianships, appoint illustrious
persons of any rank whatsoever, who are properly qualified, guardians or
curators; and let them, as judges and experts, freely make such appointments
without liability for any damages which may result from their acts. And if any
of those who are eligible are not equal to the management of the property of
the wards, it is proper that several be designated for this purpose in
accordance with the ancient laws; so that he whom the assembly determines to be
most worthy of administering the guardianship of said wards may obtain the
appointment by the sole decision of the Prefect; and after all the formalities
have been complied with, the decree shall be issued by the Praetor. Therefore,
all those who were present will be free from apprehension, and a just defence
will be provided for the noble children and adults by the deliberation of these
learned men.
It is, however, evident that We have established this regulation with reference
to persons who have neither testamentary nor legal defenders to protect their
lives, their age, or their property. Where men of this kind are appointed, and
take no action for the defence of the rights of their wards, We prescribe by
law that they can be held liable. We also decree that everything else which has
been provided by former laws with reference to the cases of minors shall remain
unaltered.
In the provinces governed by decurions, where guardians and curators are to be
appointed for noble persons, they must give proper security, and, mindful of
the risk they run, recognize that the property shall hereafter be liable to
indemnify the said minors for any losses which they may sustain.
Given at Milan, on the third of the Kalendsof January, under the Consulate of
Timasius and Promotus, 389.
2. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Aure-lian, Prefect of
the City.
It is provided by this general law that decurions, occupied with the duties of
their office, shall not be called to the guardianship of senators.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of
Theodosius, Consul for the third time, and Abundantius, 393.
TITLE XXXIV.
WHO CAN APPOINT GUARDIANS AND CURATORS AND WHO CANNOT BE APPOINTED.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Amphibulus.
As you are at such an age that it is clear that your affairs should be
administered by guardians or curators, for the reason that you allege that a
dispute has arisen with reference to your freedom, it is not necessary for an
obstacle to be placed in the way of the appointment of a curator, by whom your
case may be defended, because in the meantime you are considered to be free.
Given on the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of Alexander, 223.
2. The Same to Arthemisia.
Although a husband should attend to the business of his wife, still, he cannot
have a curator appointed for her.
Given on the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Fuscus, Consul for the
second time, and Dexter, 226.
3. The Emperor Philip- to Dolens.
The statement made to you that a curator should be appointed for one who is
blind is false.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of
Peregrinus and ^Emilianus, 245.
4. The Same to Emeritus.
A soldier engaged in the performance of military duties cannot be appointed a
guardian or a curator, whether he is legally entitled to hold the office, or
has been designated by will, or in any other way, even though he may consent.
When, however, being unaware of his incapacity, he administers the office, he
will be liable to an action on the ground of business transacted.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Peregrinus
and ^milianus, 245.
5. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Ctesars, to .zEmiliana.
It is a certain rule of law that a person who is born in another state, and who
does not have his domicile where he is named, cannot legally be appointed a
guardian by the Governor of another province, or by the municipal magistrates
of the same, when he is not subject to their jurisdiction. Hence, when he
ceases to discharge the duties of the office wrongfully imposed upon him, this
does not render him liable.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors.
6. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Leontius.
Apply to the Governor of the province for the decision of the question referred
to, namely, that a mother refuses to demand guardians for her children; and if
he ascertains that she has neglected her duty, the said magistrate will not be
prevented from appointing guardians, or he can order the names of persons to be
presented to him, so they can be confirmed by his decree.
Given on the second of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors.
7. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Rufus.
There is no doubt that a guardian or curator cannot legally be appointed by a
Governor for a person of servile condition.
Given at Philippopolis, on the second of the Nonesof July, during the Consulate
of the same Emperors.
8. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Evelpistus.
There is no doubt that when a creditor is appointed the guardian of his
debtors, he not only loses his right of action against them, but that also he
can pay himself.
Given on the fifth of the Nonesof June, during the Consulate of the Caesars.
Extract from Novel 72, Chapter II. Latin Text.
The debtor of a minor, or one to whom a minor is liable, or one who has the
property of the latter in his possession, is prohibited from acting as his
curator. If a curator should subsequently become the creditor of the minor, he
cannot administer his affairs without the addition of another curator; for, in
this instance, he who is appointed must either prove or swear in the beginning
that the minor is indebted to him, or that his property is in his possession.
If he remains silent, he shall lose his right of action. Likewise, if the
debtor remains silent, he will not be entitled to rescind his contract, or pay
the debt during the existence of the curatorship. If, however, the curator
receives the assignment of an action against the minor, he will not be
permitted to make use of it, even after the expiration of his term of office;
nor can the person who assigned it to him bring suit, as he has violated the
law, although the assignment may have been made for just reasons; but the minor
will be pecuniarily benefited.
These provisions are valid, and apply to every curatorship, including those of
spendthrifts and insane or demented persons, as well as to all others
introduced by the laws.
9. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Maximian.
If you have been appointed guardian of your sister's children whose paternal
uncle has already been made their guardian, and who has not
yet claimed any privilege of exemption, there is no doubt that, as the minors
already have a guardian, the laws forbid another to be appointed, and that the
former must discharge the duties of the administration ; and you will not be
liable under the said appointment.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
10. The Same Emperors and Csesars to the Soldier Florentinus.
There is no doubt in law that a curator cannot be added when the person in
question already has one, unless where proper cause is shown; and one cannot be
substituted instead of another, if the latter . has not previously been
removed. Therefore, you will be liable for the injury sustained by the business
of your wards in the meantime, as you should have appointed an agent to act in
your stead at your own risk; since it is certain that a magistrate cannot
appoint another curator to act for you during your absence.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of the Caesars.
11. The Emperor Constantius, and the C&sar Constantine, to Bassus, Prefect of
the City.
It is decreed that, in all kinds of actions, no one can appear in court before
he reaches the age of puberty, unless by a special decree, or where a curator
has been appointed for the purpose of administering his patrimony, or conduct
the litigation, in order that any disputes which may arise during the course of
the proceedings may be terminated promptly in accordance with law.
Given at Aquileia, on the third of the Idesof October, during the Consulate of
Constantius and Licinius, 312.
12. The Emperors Valentinian, Gratian, and Theodosius to Eutro-pius, Prsetorian
Prefect.
A curator appointed for a minor cannot abandon a case after issue has been
joined, or withdraw from the administration of the trust under the pretext
that, after the suit was commenced, a special curator to conduct it was
appointed by himself.
Given at Constantinople, on the fourth of the Kalendsof October, during the
Consulate of Eucherius and Syagrius, 381.
13. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Monaxius, Urban Prefect.
In order that the authority of magistrates may not be exceeded, We give notice
that no tenant of the Emperor, nor anyone else who has a right to protect
himself by special privilege from such an appointment, shall be compelled to
discharge the duties of guardianship.
Given during the Consulate of Honorius, Consul for the eighth time, and
Theodosius, Consul for the third time, 409.
235
TITLE XXXV.
WHEN A WOMAN CAN DISCHARGE THE DUTIES OF GUARDIANSHIP.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Otacilia.
It is the privilege of men to administer the office of guardian, as duties of
this kind cannot be undertaken by women on account of the weakness of their
sex.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of Julian,
Consul for the second time, and Crispinus, 409.
2. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Tatian, Praetorian
Prefect.
Mothers who, after the death of their husbands, petition for the guardianship
of their children and the administration of their affairs, must, before they
are confirmed in office in accordance with law, state solemnly in writing under
oath that they will not marry again. No woman, however, shall be forced to
accept an office of this kind, but shall be free to do so under the conditions
which We have established; for if she prefers to contract a second marriage,
she should not administer the guardianship. But in order that it may not be
easy for her to violate her obligations, after she has once undertaken the
legal guardianship, We order that the property of the husband who married her
while she was administering it shall become encumbered, and be liable to the
little children in order that none of their property may be lost by neglect or
fraud.
We add to these provisions that if the woman is of full age, she shall have the
right to demand the guardianship, when either a testamentary or a legal
guardian is lacking, or when such a one is, by special privilege, excused from
acting, or has been removed from office by reason of suspicion, or where he has
been ascertained to be unfit to administer the property through weakness of
either mind or body. If, however, the woman should refuse the guardianship, and
prefer to marry again, then the Illustrious Prefect of the City, having
summoned the Praetor who has jurisdiction of the appointment of guardians, or
the judges who dispense justice in the provinces, shall, after investigation,
direct defenders selected from another order to be appointed for the said
minors.
Given at Milan, on the twelfth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate
of Valentinian, Consul for the fourth time, and Neo-terius, 373.
Extract from Novel,8, Chapter V. Latin Text.We permit the mother and
grandmother, in their order, to assume the guardianship even before agnates,
when either of them has declared in writing that she will not contract another
marriage, and renounces the benefit of the Velleian Decree of the Senate.
Testamentary guardians, however, will alone be preferred to the mother and
grandmother, and will take precedence of legal and other guardians
that may be appointed, as We desire the intention of the deceased to be carried
out. With the exception of these women, We forbid all others to discharge the
duties of guardians.
Extract from Novel 91, Chapter II. Latin Text.
The oath is not required at present, but it is settled that where a woman
contracts a second marriage, she can be removed from the guardianship, and that
she shall be fully liable to the minors, so far as is provided by law.
Extract from Novel 94. Latin Text.
In addition to this, if indebtedness of any description exists between the
mother and her children, she cannot be permitted to act as their guardian as
long as the obligation remains unpaid. The mother, however, can administer the
guardianship of her natural children, if she observes all the formalities which
are prescribed in the case of legitimate children.
3. The Emperor Justinian to Julian, Praetorian Prefect.
If a father did not, in accordance with Our Constitution, appoint any
testamentary guardian for his natural children, for the administration of the
property which came to them from him, and their mother should desire to assume
their guardianship, whether they are girls or boys, it shall be lawful for her
to do so, as in the case of legitimate offspring, provided she previously
swears before a competent judge that she will not contract a second marriage,
but will preserve her chastity intact, and will renounce the benefit of the
Velleian Decree of the Senate and every other legal privilege, and render her
own property liable. Under such circumstances, We consent for her to be the
guardian of her natural sons or daughters, and that all the provisions of the
Imperial Constitutions which have reference to mothers, and their children born
in lawful marriage, shall be observed by parents of this description. For if
they can be appointed guardians of legitimate children who have a right to
testamentary or legal guardians, and are themselves permitted to be the
guardians of their children where others are lacking, there is much more
reason, and it is much more humane in cases of this kind, where no legal
guardianship can exist, for their mothers to be appointed.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof April, during the
fifth Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
TITLE XXXVI.
IN CASES WHERE A MINOR ALREADY HAS A GUARDIAN OR CURATOR, ANOTHER GUARDIAN OR
CURATOR CAN BE
APPOINTED.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Tyberian and Rufus.
When the guardian in whose stead you have been temporarily appointed, having
been absent on public business, has performed the
service which was imposed upon him, and returned, you should entertain no doubt
that the affairs of the female ward come within the scope of his duty and care,
and you will act for the benefit of your own interest if you appear before the
eminent Governor of the province, and request that the guardian be compelled to
resume the administration of the trust.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Antoninus,
Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
2. The Emperor Alexander to Valentinian.
A competent judge could and should have appointed a curator instead of the one
who has been excused, even though the minor may already have had other
guardians. Moreover, although he may have been substituted, together with
others, in the place of the guardian who has been excused, still, you will not
be liable for the risk of the administration after the age of puberty.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof June, during the Consulate of Modestus and
Probus, 229.
3. The Same to Hylas.
If the Governor of the province does not consider that you are sufficiently
solvent, as the property of your wards is scattered, that is to say, situated
in different places, or if you alone are not competent to undertake the
administration of the same, he must decide whether it is necessary for other
curators to be joined with you for the purpose of administering the
guardianship.
Given on the eighth of the Idesof December, during the Consulate of Pompeianus
and Pelignus, 232.
4. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus to Euploius.
Although a guardian cannot be appointed for a person who already has one,
still, another who is suitable can, under certain circumstances, be substituted
by the decree of a competent court, instead of one who, having been suspected,
has been convicted and removed; and also instead of a guardian who has been
excused, or who is dead, or who has been relegated.
Given on the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Secularis, Consul for the
second time, and Donatus, 261.
5. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Zeno.
As it is usual to add new curators on account of the increase of the property
of the wards, those last appointed are not released from responsibility for the
administration of the guardianship. For certainly if he who has ceased to
administer the trust was solvent at the time of its termination, it is clear
that no liability will attach to you for any subsequent period.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of the Csesars.
'
TITLE XXXVII.
CONCERNING THE ADMINISTRATION OF GUARDIANS AND CURATORS, AND OF MONEY BELONGING
TO THE WARDS WHICH HAS EITHER BEEN LENT AT INTEREST, OR
DEPOSITED.
Extract from Novel 72, Chapter VI. Latin Text.
It has very recently been provided that money belonging to a ward shall not be
lent at interest by his curator, and if the latter should do so, he must assume
the risk of the loan, except when the entire property subject to his
administration is movable, for then the curator is only compelled to lend a sum
sufficient for the support of the minor, and for the preservation of his
estate. Any property in excess of this must be carefully preserved, unless the
guardian is compelled by necessity to lend it, as, for instance, for the
purpose of paying the expenses , of his ward.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Modestus.
It is without good reason that you hesitate to administer the property of the
youth whose curator you are, on the ground that someone may think that you are
liable for the time preceding your appointment; but do those things which you
think should be done, and (as is the interest of all parties) see that the
judge appointed to decide between you and the guardians discharges his duty as
soon as possible.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of Albinus
and ^Emilianus, 207.
2. The Same Emperors to Timon and Elpidophorus.
You cannot bring suit against the curator of a youth with whom you have been
appointed a colleague, as long as your common administration exists.
Given on the second of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Aper and
Maximus, 208.
3. The Emperor Antoninus to Eumosus.
If it is proved before the judge who has jurisdiction of matters of this kind
that the expenses incurred by you were necessary for your ward, and are due to
just and honorable causes, he will direct that an account be taken of the same,
even if a decree of the Praetor was not issued with reference to their payment;
for whatever has been expended in good faith by guardians or curators is rather
confirmed by justice than by the authority of others.
Given on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of the
two Aspers, 213.
4. The Same to Procula.
Unless it is established that the money which was due (according to his
accounts) from the paternal freedman who was the guardian
of your daughter was either deposited by him, or expended in the purchase of
land, it must be paid over to the Prefect'of the City, and the guardian shall
be punished by him in accordance with what is prescribed by law.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of the
Emperor Antoninus, Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
5. The Same to Rufinus.
It is in vain that the former guardians of the young men, whose curatorship you
are administering, refuse to comply with the judgment rendered against them, as
the money collected can be placed on deposit by order of the Governor.
Given on the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of Laetus, Consul for the
second time, and Cerealis, 216.
6. The Emperor Alexander to Poconius.
It is not unknown that, where guardians or curators purposely institute
vexatious actions in the name of their wards or minors, they must, on that
account, be punished, lest they may think that they can fraudulently and with
impunity bring actions of their own, under the pretext of acting in behalf of
their wards, or minors.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof May, during the Consulate of Maximus, Consul
for the second time, and ^lianus, 224.
7. The Same to Valerius.
You should administer the guardianship of your wards in such a way as not to
sell the building which was left to them, as it was devised under the condition
that it should not be alienated.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof July, during the Consulate of Maximus, Consul
for the second time, and ^lianus, 224.
8. The Same to Aprilus.
If you are aware that you have been appointed curator and you do not administer
the trust, an action cannot be brought against you, if there are other curators
who have administered the curator-ship and are solvent. If, however, you did
not know that you were appointed curator, no liability will attach to you, even
if the others should be insolvent.
Given on the seventh of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of
Alexander, Consul for the third time, and Dio, 230.
9. The Same to Inclyta.
If you have curators, and they are unwilling to endow you with your own
property, having appeared before the Governor of the province, you can have
them compelled to provide a dowry suited to a person of honorable rank.
Given on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Agricola
and Clementinus, 231.
10. The Same to Rufina.
If you have suffered any injury through the negligence or fraud of the freedman
who is your curator, the Governor of the province will take measures that the
damage shall be made good by him who is responsible for it, and you should
entertain no doubt that more severe measures will be taken, if fraud has been
so openly committed that the freedman, after having been convicted of the
crime, should be punished for having perpetrated it.
Given on the eleventh of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Agricola
and Clementinus, 231.
11. The Emperor Gordian to Csecilius.
If the female ward, whose guardian you are, had a good case, and you did not
take an appeal from the judgment rendered against her; or if, after the appeal,
you did not comply with the formalities required by such a proceeding, you must
indemnify your ward in an action on guardianship.
Given on the Idesof August, during the Consulate of Gordian and Aviola, 240.
12. The Same to Octaviana.
You should take action with reference to the matters which you allege have been
fraudulently or negligently conducted by the guardian or curator of those to
whom you have succeeded, provided you have reached lawful age, for you are not
ignorant that the number of children is of very little advantage to women in
the administration of their affairs, if they are under lawful age.
Given on the third of the Nonesof October, during the Consulate of Gordian and
Pompeianus, 242.
13. The Same to Longinus.
It is clear that guardians have a right to demand anything that is due to their
wards, or placed on deposit, without being required to furnish security.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Arian and
Pappus, 244.
14. The Emperor Philip, and the Csssar Philip, to Clement.
It is certain that the accounts of the administration of a curator-ship cannot
legally be demanded during the term of office of the curator, that is to say,
before the minor has attained his twenty-fifth year.
Given on the day before the Nonesof August, during the Consulate of Philip,
Consul for the second time, and Titian, 246.
15. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Licinius.
If you have not signed as surety, you need be under no apprehension of having
suit brought against you as curator, on account of your having signed in that
capacity, as you state that you have been released from liability by a decree
of the Governor.
Given on the day before the Nonesof March, during the Consulate of Diocletian,
Consul for the third time, and Maximian, 287.
16. The Same Emperors and Czesars to Proculus.
Guardians have not the power to alienate the property of their wards without
restriction, but they should, in making a sale, do so only for the advantage of
the administration of such property as they are permitted to dispose of, and
must furnish to the purchasers a just title to possession. Therefore, as
guardians, under no circumstances, have authority to give away the property of
those whose affairs they are managing, you will not be prevented from claiming
the ownership of the property in question from those now in possession.
Given at Heraclea, on the tenth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate.of
the above-mentioned Emperors.
17. The Same Emperors and Caesars to Martialis.
Guardians need be under no apprehension with reference to their succession, as
the execution of a will is not denied to those who have administered a
guardianship, and they are not forbidden to give away any of their own
property.
Given on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
18. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Sotericus.
As you state that you have been appointed a guardian, notify the debtors of
your female ward to make payment as is required by your office, for liability
for the collection of the claims attaches to you. If they fail to satisfy their
debts, you can have recourse to the Common Law by selling the pledges.
Given on the day before the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
19. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Vindicianus.
When a guardian is appointed by a decree during his absence, and he is not
excused according to law, after having been notified, he will remain liable for
the administration of the guardianship.
Given on the third of the Idesof February, during the Consulate of the Csesars.
20. The Emperor Constantine to Euphemiana.
Minors are not prevented from claiming for themselves the property of their
guardians or curators, on account of their liability for their administration,
just as if the said property had been pledged to them.
The same rule applies where a guardian or curator is appointed, and does not
administer the property of the minors.
Given on the seventh of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Volusianus
and Annianus, 314.
21. The Same Emperors to Maximus, Praetorian Prefect.
The guardians of wards or minors are responsible for any loss of property, if
the conditions upon which donations are dependent are neglected by them.
Given at Rome, on the third of the Kalendsof February, under the Consulate of
Sabinus and Rufinus, 316.
22. The Same to the People.
The law which requires guardians and curators to sell and reduce to money all
gold, silver, jewels, clothing, and other valuable personal effects, as well as
urban estates and slaves, buildings, baths, and warehouses and other property
in the city, excepting rustic estates and slaves, is a rule which operates
greatly to the disadvantage of minors. Hence, We order that no guardian or
curator shall be permitted to sell any property of this description, unless
required to do so by necessity, or by former laws, under which he is authorized
to dispose of rustic estates and slaves, or pledge them or give them as a
donation on account of marriage, or by way of dowry; this, of course, having
been done after judicial investigation, proof of the case and rendition of a
judgment, in order that there may be no room for fraud.
Therefore urban slaves, who- alone are familiar with the entire personal
property, shall by all means always be retained as a part of the estate and
household. For good slaves prevent the commission of fraud, and bad ones, where
circumstances demand it, having been subjected to torture, can be compelled to
reveal the truth; and all things shall be done in such a manner that the
guardian cannot diminish, change, or suppress anything from the inventory. This
is necessary with reference to clothing, pearls, gems, vases, and other
personal property. In such cases it is better for slaves to die in the houses
of their masters than to serve strangers. Responsibility for their flight
should attach to the guardian, who has either caused discipline to be relaxed
by his negligence, or has punished the slaves with undue severity, or subjected
them to starvation or scourging, for they love their masters more than they
hate them. This law is better than the ancient one, for, under the terms of the
latter, the custody of slaves was relaxed, and the life of minors frequently
endangered.
It is not permitted to sell the house in which the father died or the minor was
brought up, for it would be sad enough not to see the statues of the family
ancestors fastened therein, or to have them torn away. Therefore the house and
all other immovable property shall remain as part of the patrimony of the
minors, and no building of any kind originally belonging to the estate shall be
destroyed, or allowed to fall into ruin through the fraudulent acts of the
guardian. If, however, the father or any other person of whom the minor is the
heir should leave a building in bad condition, the guardian, after having taken
the evidence of several persons with reference to it, shall be compelled to
repair it, so that the annual rent will bring more to the minors than the value
of the same will lose by neglect.
Slaves, who are familiar with any trade, must contribute their labors to the
profit of the minor, and the others who have no trade and cannot be of any use
to their master, shall be supported partly by their labor, and partly by
provisions forming part of the estate. This law has in view not only the
interests of minors, as against their guardians, but also as against prodigal
and dissolute women, who, for the most part, not only abandon the property of
their children but also the lives of the latter to their new husbands.
It happened under the old law, by whose provisions the practice of loaning at
interest money belonging to minors (on which the ancients based the entire
force of patrimony), that this practice was no sooner temporary than it became
permanent and established; and that the money loaned under such circumstances
was often lost, and the inheritance of the minors reduced to nothing. Hence a
sale of property made by a guardian without the authority of a decree shall be
null and void, with the exception solely of such clothing as, being worn out by
use, or, having been spoiled, can serve no purpose by being preserved. We do
not forbid superfluous animals to be sold, even though they may be the property
of minors.
Given on the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Constantine, Consul for the
seventh time, and Constantine-Csesar, 326.
23. The Same to Felix.
If, through the negligence or fraud of his guardian or curator, the land of a
minor should be lost because he was unwilling to pay the rent imposed upon said
land by emphyteutical contract, the said guardian or curator shall be required
to indemnify the minor out of his own property for any loss which he may have
sustained.
Given at Constantinople, on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof May, during the
Consulate of Dalmatius and Xenophilus, 333.
24. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Eutychianus, Prse-torian Prefect.
Guardians or curators, immediately after their appointment, must, in the
presence of public officials, be careful to make a formal inventory of all the
property and credits of the minors. They must also place all gold, silver, and
other personal property which is not changed by lapse of time, that is found
among the effects of the ward, in as safekeeping as possible, so that they can
purchase suitable lands with the proceeds of said property; or if none can be
found (as is usual) they can, in compliance with the terms of the ancient law,
provide for the increase of said property by means of loans at interest, the
collection of which is at the risk of the guardian.
Given at Constantinople, on the seventh of the Kalends ofMarch, during the
Consulate of Arcadius, Consul for the fourth time, and Honorius, Consul for the
third time, 396.
25. The Emperor Justinian to John, Prsetorian Prefect.We order that the debtors
of wards or minors shall be permitted to make payment to them through the
medium of their guardians and
curators, who have previously given proper security, provided that this has
been done by virtue of a judicial decision without any loss. After this has
taken place, and the judge has rendered his decision, and the debtor has
discharged the obligation, he shall then enjoy perfect security, and no one
shall subsequently be subjected to annoyance on this account; for whatever has
been done properly and in accordance with law in the beginning should not be
revived in any event whatsoever.
We do not, however, extend the operation of this law to rents, income, or
anything else of this kind to which the ward or the minor may be entitled; but
if a foreign debtor should desire to make payment and release himself from
liability arising from a loan at interest, or from any other such obligation,
he can do so, for then We order that the above formalities shall be observed.
Given at Constantinople, on the tenth of the Kalendsof March, after the fifth
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
26. The Same to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
A certain woman, having drawn up her will, passed over her son, and the latter
became the guardian or curator of his brother, or of a stranger who had been
appointed heir by the mother of the guardian or curator. In the present
instance, it is perfectly plain that the guardian or curator occupies a
dangerous position; for whether he refuses his authority or consent for the
ward or minor to enter upon the estate, lest by doing so his rights may be
prejudiced (for if he does, he runs the imminent risk of an action of
guardianship on the ground of voluntary agency being brought against him by
either the ward or the minor to indemnify him for loss suffered through his
delay), or whether he, being alarmed by apprehensions of this kind, gives his
consent, he still runs a risk, as by acquiescence he loses his rights, for he
appears to have confirmed the will of his mother, which he thought should be
attacked.
In addition to this, many other cases arise in which a guardian or curator may
be apprehensive of prejudicing his interests, as, for instance, where
hypothecation and various other matters are involved.
We find that it has been generally laid down that all rights of action to which
a guardian or curator is liable on account of his conduct in office should be
assigned against the former ward or minor, after the guardian or curator has
relinquished his trust. Induced by this excellent example, We desire to remove
the fear of a guardian or curator in all other cases also, in which he may
apprehend that his rights will in some manner be prejudiced; therefore We grant
him the power to administer the affairs of his wards or minors with the
greatest confidence, being aware that this Our law preserved for him his rights
unimpaired, and that he will suffer no loss through giving his authority or
consent under such circumstances.
Given at Constantinople, on the tenth of the Kalendsof September, after the
fifth Consulship of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
27. The Same to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
We extend the scope of the Constitution that We have recently promulgated,
which has reference to payments to be made in the case of the contracts of
minors, whether they relate to rents, income, or other similar sources, as well
as to interest. It is, however, only applicable to interest recently due, and
not to that accrued for several years, the total of which does not exceed the
sum of a hundred solidi.
Given at Constantinople on the tenth of the Kalendsof November, after the fifth
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
28. The Same to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
We decree that no guardian or curator of a ward, a minor, a madman, or any
other person for whom curators are appointed under the ancient laws, as well as
under Our Laws and Constitutions, shall refuse to undertake the defence of such
a person which he has agreed to conduct, but that he shall defend all those
above mentioned from the beginning of the suit, in every way authorized by law,
and shall prepare their cases in a proper manner, being well aware that this is
a necessary duty of his guardianship or curatorship. If, however, he should
refuse to do so, or delay to act, he can not only be removed on the ground of
suspicion, and be considered infamous, but he shall also be compelled to make
good out of his own property all losses which the persons aforesaid may sustain
through his refusal to undertake their defence.
(1) Where, however, anyone, after having been notified that proceedings have
been instituted against him, furnishes the ordinary security required in
proceedings of this kind, either after issue has been joined in which he has
appeared by himself and not by an attorney, or if he should become demented or
insane, We order that he shall at once have a curator appointed for him by a
competent court, through the care and foresight of the judge before whom the
action is pending, as well as through that of the cognates and other relatives
of the party in question, and even through the agency of the plaintiff, if he
should desire this to be done, so that the suit brought by him may not be too
greatly prolonged, and the curator who has been appointed may be required to
conduct the defence, and attend to the other matters growing out of the action.
(2) Those also (whether they be mothers or any other persons) who, at their own
risk, have asked that guardians and curators of their own property be
appointed, should compel the individuals whom they have designated as guardians
or curators to prepare to undertake the defence of the parties whom they
represent. If they should be unwilling to do this, and, on account of their
refusal, should be removed from the guardianship or curatorship, We require the
persons aforesaid to designate other guardians or curators for the
administration of those matters for which guardians or curators are appointed,
who will declare openly that they will conduct the defence. Lest such persons
may be abandoned without proper protection, or the rights of the parties
interested may remain too long without being
decided, We decree that immediately, that is to say, after the refusal of those
who were designated to undertake the defence, in cases (as has already been
stated) when this can be done, the appointment of other guardians and curators
shall be made, the cognates, other relatives, connections by marriage,
creditors, and all other persons who are interested being present, and advising
those who, according to the laws, have a right to appoint guardians or
curators.
(3) In this instance, wishing to state and define more clearly what kind of a
defence should be conducted, lest guardians or curators may think that too
heavy a burden is imposed upon them, We decree that they shall make such a
defence as does not require security to be furnished with a view to the
termination of the action; but only that they will proceed in behalf of the
ward or minor or any other person whom they represent, in conformity with the
provisions of the laws, and by the authority of this enactment, they are
granted permission to give the property subject to their administration as
security for the lawsuit, without any decree.
(4) Desiring to remove all doubt with reference to the defence of wards,
minors, and other persons, We order that guardians and curators shall not be
appointed, unless they first solemnly declare that every step for the
administration of the property of those entrusted to their care will be taken
by them, not only in the conduct of their affairs, but also in whatever relates
to furnishing security for the same. They must also state in plain terms that
they will conduct the defence of their wards and minors, and the other persons
previously mentioned, without any delay whatever, as they are required to do.
(5) In order to leave no doubt on this point, We add to these provisions that
all guardians and curators shall be permitted to sell at a just price, and
without any decree of court, all crops of every description, that is to say,
wine, oil, and grain, whether these are obtained from the rents of land, or
have been derived from property of the persons under their control, at the
price at which they are worth at the time and place of the sale, and any money
which may be collected from the sale of said crops shall be administered along
with the other property of the said wards, minors, or other persons.
Given at Constantinople, on the twelfth of the Kalendsof November, after the
fifth Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
TITLE XXXVIII.
CONCERNING THE LIABILITIES OF GUARDIANS AND CURATORS.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Quantus.
Freedmen who are appointed guardians on account of their knowledge of the
circumstances of their wards, although they alone may not be invested with the
power of administering the property of the said wards or minors on account of
their poverty, are, nevertheless,
all liable, whether they conceal from their fellow-guardians or curators those
things which they ought to know, as being connected with the welfare of their
wards, or whether they are guilty of fraud, either alone or in complicity with
others, or whether they should be regarded as suspicious, or whether they fail
to discharge the duties of their office, or do not manifest the respect which
they should do.
Given on the ninth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of
Alexander, Consul for the second time, and Marcellus, 227.
2. The Same to Saturus.
Personal liability for the administration of guardians who transact the affairs
of wards in one province does not extend to those who administer the
guardianship in another.
Given on the Nonesof July, during the Consulate of Alexander, Consul for the
second time, and Marcellus, 227.
3. The Emperor Philip and the Csesar Philip to Graticm..
If the property belonging to your ward, which was deposited in a warehouse and
which you should have sold, has been consumed by fire in your lodging, as you
allege, you assert without good reason that you should not bear the loss
resulting from your negligence or inactivity, but that it should be sustained
by your ward.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Philip and
Titian, 246.
4. The Same Emperor and Caesar to Florus.
It has frequently been stated in rescripts that guardians and curators are not
responsible for accidental occurrences which could not be provided against.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of Philip
and Titian, 246.
5. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Severus.
If you have been appointed guardian on petition, or by will, and have not
learned of your appointment, not because of negligence, but through excusable
ignorance, and you establish this fact by clear proofs, you will not be liable
for the administration of the guardianship during the time you were ignorant
that it had been conferred upon you.
Given on the third of the Idesof September, during the Consulate of Diocletian,
Consul for the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third time, 290.
6. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Epictetus.
It is reasonable that a guardian should not be responsible for the
administration of the guardianship, for any time following the termination of
the same.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
TITLE XXXXXXIIXX..
WHEN MINORS CAN SUE OB BE SUED ON ACCOUNT OP THE ACTS OF THEIR GUARDIANS OR
CURATORS.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Septimius.
If Juliana, against whose curators a decision has been rendered in your favor,
has passed her twenty-fifth year, a praetorian action to enforce judgment can
be brought by you against her, and her property, for it has frequently been
decided that guardians and curators cannot be sued on account of their
administration of the affairs of wards or minors after the termination of their
office.
Given at Rome on the eighth of the Kalendsof July, under the Consulate of
Antoninus, Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
2. The Emperor Alexander to Sorarchus.
Although your guardians, when they lent your money, made stipulations in their
own names, you will be entitled to an equitable action.
3. The Emperor Gordian to Prudentianus.
If the money lent in the name of the minor to the guardian or curator has been
employed for the benefit of the property of the former, it is only reasonable
that a personal action should be granted against the said minor.
Given on the Nonesof September, during the Consulate of Gordian and Aviola,
240.
4. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Maximiana.
If those who have been appointed your guardians or curators while you were
under age should afterwards continue to administer your affairs, and lease your
lands, sue them in accordance with the forms of the law. An equitable action
based on their contracts can be demanded by you against the heirs of the
lessee.
Given on the third of the Nonesof March, under the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors.
5. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Onesima.
A right of action cannot be transferred by a guardian to his ward unless for
certain reasons.
Given on the Idesof December, during the Consulate of the Csesars.
TITLE XL.
WHERE THERE ARE SEVERAL GUARDIANS OR CURATORS,
ALL OR ONE OF THEM CAN SUE OR BE SUED IN THE
NAME OF THE MINOR.
1. The Emperor Antonins to the Soldier Cassius.
You should not be ignorant that a case can be defended by one of the guardians
or curators of a minor, when the others refuse to undertake the defence.
Given on the Nonesof November, during the Consulate of Mes-sala and Sabinus,
215.
2. The Emperor Constantine, and the Csesar Licinius, to Sym-machus.
If liability for the administration has been divided among guardians by
provinces, it issettled that those only can sue and be sued who are discharging
the duties of the guardianship and curatorship in each province, to prevent the
guardians of minors in one province from being brought into court in another.
Given on the day before the Nonesof February, during the Consulship of
Constantine and Licinius, 319.
TITLE XLI.
NEITHER A GUARDIAN NOR A CURATOR SHALL ACT AS A COLLECTOR OF TAXES.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Sextus.
A competent judge is well aware that those who are conducting the affairs
either of the guardianship or curatorship of wards or minors, and have not yet
rendered the account of their administration, should not be permitted to act as
collectors of taxes. But although you accepted an office of this kind contrary
to law, as you have voluntarily appeared before me, you will not be guilty of
the crime of deceit, if you satisfy the Treasury as well as your wards. If,
however, being already liable to the Treasury on this account, you state that
you have subsequently been appointed a guardian, you can be released from
liability for the guardianship.
Given at Rome on the eighth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of
Antoninus, Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
TITLE XLII.
CONCERNING THE GUARDIAN OR CURATOR WHO DOES NOT FURNISH SECURITY.
1. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus to Titus and Flavianus.
If you have not yet reached lawful age, demand security from those who you
state have been appointed your curators by your adversary while he was
performing the functions of a magistrate, and who are not solvent, for they
should be prevented from administering your affairs, unless they provide for
your security by means of a bond.
Given on the Nonesof July, during the Consulate of ^milianus and Bassus, 260.
2. The Same Emperors, and the Ctesar Valerian, to Euploius.
Application having been made to the Governor of the province, he will order
that if the remaining guardian does not furnish secu-
rity in accordance with his order and the requirements of the law, he shall be
removed from office if, without being branded with infamy, he did this on
account of poverty; but if he has acted fraudulently he will be considered
infamous, and the Governor shall order other suitable guardians to be
substituted in the place of those who are deceased, especially as you allege
that the patrimony of the ward has been increased by the addition of another
estate. The guardians who have been appointed must demand an account of the
guardianship from the heirs of those who you say have died.
Given on the Idesof May, during the Consulate of Secullaris and Donatus, 261.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Stratonicus.
There is no doubt that guardians who have not been appointed by will have no
authority to administer property unless the guardianship is protected by
security previously furnished. Therefore, where a guardian who has not given
security for his administration is sued, the judgment rendered against him
cannot affect your rights, nor can the business which he has transacted be
considered as possessing any validity. Hence you will in vain apply for the
relief of complete restitution, when whatever has been done by him is void in
law.
Given at Nicomedia, on the eighteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the
Consulate of Diocletian, Consul for the third time, and Maximian, 287.
4. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Tertullus.
The condition of all guardians is not the same. For example, where a
testamentary guardian has been confirmed by a Governor, or one is appointed
after investigation, it is clear that he is not required to give security for
the preservation of the property of his ward; still, it has long been the
practice that where several guardians have been appointed after investigation,
and one of them has, in accordance with the terms of the Edict, furnished
security for the preservation of the property of his ward, he shall be
preferred to the others in the administration of the guardianship.
Given at Nicomedia, on the Idesof December, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
5. The Emperors Constantine and Maximian to the Csesars Sev-erus and Maximus.
A guardian who is obliged to furnish security, but has not done so, cannot in
any manner alienate any of the property of his ward. But it is perfectly
evident that, after he has been chosen for the administration of the
guardianship, he can demand possession of the property in the name of his ward,
and that he should perform any other acts which are necessary to be done at the
time.
Given on the eleventh of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Constantius and Maximian, 305.
TITLE XLIII. CONCERNING SUSPECTED GUARDIANS AND CURATORS.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Domitia.
You can cause your freedman, who is the guardian of your son, to be declared
liable to suspicion, if you think that he has fraudulently administered the
property of his ward, provided his office has not been terminated by the
arrival of the ward at the age of puberty; for if he has ceased to be a
guardian by law, an action of guardianship should be brought against him.
Given at Rome on the Idesof August, during the Consulate of the two Aspers,
213.
2. The Same to Longinus.
Where, through the fault of curators, the transfer of their trust to them is
delayed, they become liable. If, however, you think that this delay has been
caused by fraud, demand that they be declared suspicious, and you can have
others appointed in their stead.
Given on the Idesof January, during the Consulate of Lsetus, Consul for the
second time, and Cerealis, 216.
3. The Emperor Alexander to Fortunata.
The Governor of the province will, by the employment of more severe measures,
compel the guardians of your children to discharge the duties of their
administration. If, however, they persist in the same obstinacy, you will not
be prevented from asking that they be declared suspicious, in order that others
may be appointed in their stead.
Given on the Idesof January, during the Consulate of Alexander, Consul for the
third time, and Dio, 230.
4. The Same Emperor to Thalida.
You can demand that the guardian who has been appointed by the will of your
father be declared suspicious, if you think that he has committed fraud while
acting in that capacity.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and Paternus, 234.
5. The Same to Asclepias.
In applying for the removal of guardians or curators on the ground of
suspicion, it is necessary in the first place to carefully consider not only
the amount of their property, but whether anything has been done by them either
negligently or fraudulently.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and Paternus, 234.
6. The Emperor Gordian to Felix.
You are performing the duty required by affection when you attempt to protect
the children of your brother, as blood relationship
demands. Therefore, if their guardians or curators should not properly
administer their affairs, and, having demanded that they be declared
suspicious, you proved that this is the case, you can easily have others
appointed in their stead. If, however, they have committed no fraudulent act,
but are so poor that the property of the children of your brother will be
endangered by their administration of the same, the Governor of the province
must decide whether a curator, who is solvent, should be added to them. The
right to demand their removal is not restricted to their ascendants of either
sex, but is also enjoyed by their cognates, as well as strangers and
connections by marriage, and even by him who has the administration of the
property, if he is not under the age of puberty; which step must be approved by
his cognates of good reputation.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof November, during the Consulate of Pius and
Pontianus, 239.
7. The Same to Gorgonia.
The Governor of the province shall order him whom you accuse of being a
suspicious guardian or curator to abstain from the administration of all your
property during the hearing of the case, and until it has been terminated. In
the meantime, another may be appointed in his stead for the management of the
property.
Given on the seventh of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Sabinus,
Consul for the second time, and Venustus, 341.
8. The Emperor Philip and the C&sar Philip to Proculus.
If you have not made application for your fellow-guardian to be declared
suspicious, and be removed from the administration of the property of your
ward, the demand that you now make for him to transfer the guardianship to you
in the name of said ward, can, by no means, be admitted.
Given on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of
Peregrinus and ^milianus, 245.
9. The Emperors Diocletian and Maxvmian to Hammianus.
It is clear that guardians who have been declared suspicious on account of
fraud committed by them, and not those who have been removed on account of
negligence, become infamous.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of the Caesars.
TITLE XLIV.
CONCERNING A GUARDIAN OR CURATOR APPOINTED TO CONDUCT LITIGATION.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Miltiades.
If you have any action to bring against your wards, you can bring it, provided
your fellow-guardians appear and defend the case; and
if you have no fellow-guardians, curators should be appointed for the purpose
of defence in litigation of this kind.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of
Antoninus, Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
2. The Emperor Alexander to Evarestus.
The judge having jurisdiction of such matters shall decide whether you are
entitled to an action for the recovery of the land belonging to your father's
estate. You should, however, take into consideration your duty as guardian
(which office you say you hold), in order that, if eviction should take place
in consequence of the proceedings, you will not subject your ward, as the heir,
to the payment of a larger price than was given by the other party, if you
undertake the defence, and you can either set it off against your accounts, or
you can bring a counter action of guardianship.
Your rights, if you have any, will not be prejudiced under these circumstances;
and curators can be appointed for the ward for the purpose of defending the
case, which should be brought against you as claimant of the property.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Julian,
Consul for the second time, and Crispinus, 225.
3. The Emperor Galliemis to Valerius.
A guardian or curator appointed for the purpose of defending the case of a ward
cannot be sued for the acts of his administration, as the guardianship has only
been undertaken for a special purpose. Therefore if (as you allege) you have
transacted no business with the exception of that for which you were appointed,
suit will in vain be brought against you.
Given on the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Valerian and Lucian, 266.
4. The Same Emperor to Irenseus.
If, acting as a guardian appointed to conduct a lawsuit, you have expended
anything in good faith, you can collect it in the customary manner from your
fellow-guardians.
Given on the Kalendsof November during the Consulate of Pa-ternus and
Arcesilaus, 263.
5. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Tigranus.
When, either under the terms of a will, or through legal relationship, the
responsibility of the guardianship of the children of your brother has been
imposed upon you, you should be under no apprehensions with reference to any
disputes which you state formerly existed between you and your deceased
brother; for if suit should be brought, an attorney having been appointed, and
a curator designated to conduct the case of the wards, which should be done
with the formalities required by law, the interests of all parties will be
protected.
Given on the fourth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of the Caesars.
TITLE XLV.
CONCERNING ONE WHO TRANSACTS BUSINESS IN THE PLACE OF A GUARDIAN.
1. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus to Marcellus.
Women, also, who administer the affairs of wards in the capacity of guardians,
are required to render accounts.
Given during the Consulate of ^Emilianus and Bassus, 260.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Cazsars, tc Marcus.
A person who has not been legally appointed guardian, but who acts in the name
of minors, can be removed by an exception (if he is not a guardian), although
he may discharge the duties enjoined upon persons of this kind.
Given on the Nonesof December, during the Consulate of the Caesars.
TITLE XLVI. WHERE A MOTHER PROMISES INDEMNITY.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Brutia.
The guardians who have been appointed by the magistrates upon your application,
are at their risk, rather than that you, contrary to the condition of your sex,
should be liable to anyone for the reason that you have demanded guardians to
be appointed for your children on your own responsibility.
Given on the third of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Maximus, Consul
for the third time, and Urbanus, 225.
2. The Emperor Philip and the Csesar Philip to Asclepias and Menander.
You allege that indemnity has been promised to you in the name of your wards by
their mother and paternal uncle, who have desired to transact certain business,
and, under such circumstances, if the said wards have reached lawful age, they
can proceed against you legally, and not against their mother or their uncle;
hence, it is not without reason that you ask to be indemnified against what you
state was undertaken at their risk, during their administration of said
business.
Given on the fourth of the Idesof July, during the Consulate of Praesens and
Albinus, 247.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Caianus.
You improperly contend that the mother is liable to you for the administration
of an incapable guardian appointed at her instance, as this cannot take place
unless it was specifically stated in the decree authorizing his appointment
that she would be liable.
Given on the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the same Emperors.
TITLE XLVII.
WHERE A GUARDIAN Is APPOINTED AGAINST THE WISHES OF THE MOTHER.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Tertius.
If you prove that Fuscinius was appointed guardian of your son in opposition to
the last will of his deceased mother, the Praetor will decree that he shall be
removed from the guardianship, without being considered infamous. This
provision, however, will not apply if the guardian should be convicted of
having been guilty of fraud.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of
Lateranus and Rufinus, 198.
TITLE XLVIII.
A GUARDIAN SHOULD ASSIST IN THE TRIAL OF A CASE OF His WARD AFTER THE LATTER
REACHES PUBERTY.
1. The Emperor Philip to Dexter.
It has been frequently stated in rescripts that guardians who have not yet
transferred their administration to curators must assist in the defence of the
cases of their wards. Therefore if, as you allege, the parties whom you mention
have in their possession any documents which can be of assistance in the appeal
of the case, the Governor of the province, after application has been made to
him, shall order them to produce said documents, or be liable for not doing so.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of Philip
and Titian, 246.
TITLE XLIX. WHERE MINORS SHOULD BE BROUGHT UP.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Dionysodorus.
The bringing up of your wards should be entrusted to their mother in preference
to all other persons, if she has not given them a stepfather. Where, however, a
dispute with reference to this point arises between her and the cognates and
guardians, the Governor of the province, after having taken into consideration
the rank and relationship of the parties, should decide where the child is to
be brought up; and when he renders such a decision, he whom he charges with
this duty will be obliged to perform it.
Given on the seventh of the Idesof February, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and Julianus, 224.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Grata.
The Governor of the province will decide whether your grandson by your daughter
shall reside with you, or with his paternal uncle,
after having- taken into account the affection which each of you entertains for
him, and which one he is most likely to succeed as heir.
TITLE L. CONCERNING THE SUPPORT TO BE FURNISHED TO A WARD.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to FoMstinus.
When a ward is not furnished support by his guardian, he should apply to the
Governor of the province who will perform his duty in seeing that no delay
takes place in providing him with food.
The same rule applies if a suit is pending with reference to the status of the
ward or minor, or concerning his property.
Given at Rome, on the sixth of the Idesof July, during the Consulate of La3tus,
Consul for the second time, and Cerealis, 216.
2. The Emperor Alexander to Euphidus.
Although for the most part it is required that the support given to wards or
minors by a decision of the Prsetor should be regulated in proportion to their
means, still, sometimes those who transact the business of others make
provisions for them at their own instance, to avoid having any controversy in
court. Hence, where a guardian, being a good and innocent man, provides for his
ward in accordance with his own judgment, which it is sometimes necessary for
him to do in order to avoid revealing the secrets of the estate, and exposing
debts which may be doubtful, since, in the meantime, it is better to keep
silent than to have any inquiry made concerning the amount of their property,
by voluntarily applying to the judge to establish their allowance and giving
him information against the interests of the wards, there is no doubt that they
should be reimbursed for any expenses which they may have incurred for the
support, the bringing up, and the education of the wards, in accordance with
the opinion of a good citizen. For it should not be tolerated that a young man
who has received instruction and has been supported should refuse to pay such
expenses, if he cannot prove that they have been incurred by someone else, just
as if he had lived on wind, and was not imbued with the principles of a
freeman.
Given on the Nones ofDecember, during the Consulate of Maximus, Consul for the
second time, and ^Elianus, 224.
TITLE LI.
THE DECISION OP GUARDIANSHIP. 1. The Emperor Antoninus to Leo.
As an account of the administration of your guardianship has been demanded by
you, it is not in conformity with the trust or with legal evidence (as you
allege), for you to be compelled to show that
the testator either increased or diminished the estate of the wards by the
terms of his will.
2. The Same to Prsesentinus.
The judge who has jurisdiction over the case shall examine whether the debts
due to the estate were good at the beginning of the guardianship, and whether
they have subsequently become uncollectible through the gross negligence of the
guardian; and if it is clear that they have been depreciated through the fraud
or evident negligence of the guardian, he must provide for indemnification of
the ward by an action of guardianship growing out of the negligence of the
guardian.
Given on the Nonesof July, during the Consulate of Antoninus, Consul for the
fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
3. The Same to Vitalius.
If your curator, after a decree of the Governor, appropriates a sum of money
which had been deposited for the purchase of a certain tract of land, and
purchases it for himself, you can take your choice whether you will claim the
property as having been bought with your money, or whether you will demand it
with interest as having been converted by him to his own use. The judge before
whom the action is brought shall render his decision in accordance with the
circumstances.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Lastus,
Consul for the second time, and Cerealis, 216.
4. The Emperor Alexander to Aglaiis.
There is no reason why he who rejects the estate of his father in conformity
with the terms of the Edict should have an action of inheritance brought
against him. Nor does it make any difference if an action will lie in his favor
against his curators or guardians, where he did not designedly reject the
estate. In a proceeding of this kind, which has reference to what the guardians
did, or should have done, their negligence alone is considered; and no account
is taken of the damages sustained by the ward through not accepting the estate.
The result of this is that, if you have compromised with your guardians or
curators, no action will lie in favor of the creditors of your father as
against you.
Given on the third of the Kalends ofMay, during the Consulate of Alexander,
223.
5. The Emperor Gordian to Victorinus.
It has been established for a long time that all guardians or their heirs
should appear before the same judge. Therefore, as you allege that your father
administered the guardianship with another person, the Governor of the province
should appoint the same judge for the purpose of determining how much you, as
well as the heirs of the fellow-guardians of your father, should each be
required to pay.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Pius and
Pontianus, 239.
6. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Conon and Others.
As it is alleged that your guardian is not only guilty of having made a
forbidden sale, but also of fraud with reference to the price, the Governor of
the province should not hesitate to order the remainder of the price, together
with interest for" which your property was sold, immediately to be returned to
you, if you desire to have the sale confirmed. It is superfluous for you to
petition Us to have the heirs of him who sold the property pay you the price of
the same, which you have demanded from them, for the reason that this cannot be
concealed from the knowledge of the Governor.
The guardians who are concerned in the transaction, or their heirs, should be
sued in the first place, on account of the affairs which have been administered
by them, and the other guardians can only be held liable for damages for
business which they have transacted as substitutes. If, however, it is shown
that all of them administered the guardianship together, you will have the
right to select which one you will sue, so that the rights of action which you
have against the others may be assigned to the one whom you have chosen.
Given on the fourth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of the
Emperor Diocletian, Consul for the fourth time, and the Emperor Maximian,
Consul for the third time, 290.
7. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Alexander.
It is a certain rule of law that anything that minors have lost through the
fraud, or gross or slight negligence of a guardian or curator, they can recover
by the action of guardianship, or by the praetorian action of voluntary agency,
even if the said guardian or curator did not acquire the property when he could
have done so.
Given on the day before the Idesof April, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors.
8. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Dalmatius.
The prescription of long time does not prevent guardians from being sued in the
action of guardianship. Therefore, if you have not released your guardians by a
compromise, a novation, or a receipt, you will not be prevented from demanding
whatever is due to you before the Governor of the province.
Given on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof May, under the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors.
9. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Julian.
You can sue your former guardian before the Prsetor to compel him to render an
account, or to restore what you are entitled to and which remains in his hands.
For although it is alleged that your mother, having received the administration
of your property from the
hands of your guardian, promised to indemnify him for any loss you might
sustain in consequence, still, a right of action based on the stipulation will
lie in your favor against your mother's heirs.
Given on the day before the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
10. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Pomponius.
If the deceased administered your guardianship, you cannot claim or hold the
ownership of his property, but an action of guardianship will lie in your favor
against his heirs. It is, however, necessary for the debt to be proved by other
evidence; for as neither he nor his wife had possession of the property
previous to the administration of the guardianship, the evidence which you
offer is not sufficient; for neither industry, nor the increase of their
property which is obtained by their labor or in many other ways should be
forbidden to the poor.
Ordered on the tenth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of the
Caasars, 293.
11. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Chrusianus.
Where a guardian continues in the administration of the guardianship after a
girl has arrived at the age of puberty, he can be compelled by an action of
guardianship to render an account for the entire time. If, however, he does not
interfere in the management of the affairs of the ward after his administration
has been terminated, he will not be responsible for the time which has
subsequently
elapsed.
Given on the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 293.
12. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Quintilla.
An action of guardianship will lie in favor of the heirs of a ward against
those of the guardian.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the
Csesars, 293.
13. The Emperor Justinian to Julian, Prsetorian Prefect.
In order to dispose of the doubt attaching to the ancient law, We order that if
a guardian or curator has stated that the property of a ward or minor is
greater in amount than it really is, whether he did so for the welfare of the
ward, or minor, or through his own mistake, or for any other reason whatsoever,
it shall, in no way, prejudice the truth, but this shall prevail; and the
estimate of the property of the ward or minor shall not be calculated on any
other basis than that which the nature of the property requires. Where,
however, the said guardian or curator publicly stated the amount of the
property of the ward or minor in an inventory, and by means of a document of
this kind made it greater than it really was, the value of said property shall
not be estimated in any other way than by
means of the said inventory, and the guardian or curator shall be compelled to
render an account of the estate in accordance with the terms of that document.
For no man can be found who is so stupid (even if he is a fool) as to suffer
anything against himself to be inserted in a public inventory.
(1) The rule should be strictly observed that a guardian or curator shall not
venture to have anything to do with the property of his ward or minor, or claim
for himself any right to administer it before an inventory has been publicly
drawn up, and the said property transferred to him in the usual manner, unless
the testator from whom it was derived especially forbade an inventory of the
same to be made. All guardians and curators are notified that, if they have
failed to make an inventory, and are removed from office as being suspected,
and are subjected to the penalties provided by the laws, and are afterwards
branded with perpetual infamy, they cannot enjoy the benefit of the Imperial
absolution from this dishonor.
Given at Constantinople, on the Idesof August, during the Consulate of
Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
TITLE LII.
CONCERNING THE DIVISION OP GUARDIANSHIP, AND FOR WHAT PORTION OP THE SAME EACH
GUARDIAN Is LIABLE.
1. The Emperor Gordian to Optatus.
If, when the administration of the guardianship was terminated, your colleagues
were solvent to the extent to which they were liable, and afterwards not having
been called to account, they became insolvent, the rule of law does not permit
that the fault of others should be atoned for at your expense.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Gordian, Consul
for the second time, and Pompeianus, 242.
2. The Emperors Carinus and Numerianus to Primigenius.
If the division of the administration has not yet been made between guardians
or curators in the same place or province in which they were appointed, the
minor has a right to select one of them and collect the entire indebtedness
from him, and, by doing so, he will release any other rights of action against
the other guardians or curators to which he may be entitled. But where the
division of the administration has been made either by the Governor, or by the
will of the testator, the minor can sue either one of the said guardians or
curators on account of his share of the administration.
In a case of this kind, the guardians or curators are only responsible for the
share of the administration with which they have been entrusted, unless they
have failed to remove one of their number on account of his being suspected of
being guilty of fraud or negligence; or they stated their suspicions of this,
when it was too late, and the said guardian or curator had become insolvent; or
whether,
in proceeding against the suspected person, they have voluntarily betrayed the
interests of the ward; it will be of no advantage to them to allege that their
fellow-guardian did not administer the affairs of
the trust.
Where, however, they themselves divided the administration between them, the
minor will not be prevented from suing any one of them for the entire amount,
provided he transfers to the one whom he selects all the rights of action which
he has against the others.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Carinus,
Consul for the second time, and Numerianus, 284.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximlan, and the Csesars, to Zoticus.
Although guardians cannot, by means of a mutual agreement, release one another
from liability, still, there is no doubt that the one who administered the
trust, as well as his heirs, can be sued in the first place, if he is solvent.
Given on the fourth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
TITLE LIII.
CONCERNING THE OATH TO BE TAKEN DURING LITIGATION.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Asclepius.
When receiving a judge for the transfer of the guardianship as against the
heirs, you desire that all the documents having reference to the ward shall be
returned to you at the time of the commencement of the suit. If, through fraud,
they are not produced, you will have a right to be sworn, provided you wish to
extend the affection due to your former ward by invoking the sanction of
religion.
Given on the Kalendsof August, during the second Consulate of Antoninus and
Geta, 206.
2. The Emperor Antoninus to Sevenis.
He who demands an account of the administration of a guardianship or a
curatorship cannot be compelled against his will to take the oath in court, but
if he wishes to do so, he should be heard, if the heir of the guardian either
through fraud, or for the purpose of deceiving the ward, refuses to produce the
documents in which the latter is interested. When, however, he is not convicted
of fraud, gross negligence, or an intention to deceive the heir, as the oath
under such circumstances does not apply, the judge shall ascertain the truth
which he can do by means of convincing evidence.
Given on the eleventh of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of the two
Aspers, 213.
3. The Same to Priscianus.
The sum mentioned in the decree which the judge, after having caused you to be
sworn, has rendered against your former curators, cannot be diminished by an
agreement.
Given on the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Lsetus, Consul for the
second time, and Cerealis, 216.
4. The Emperor Gordian to Mutian.
Aguardian is subject to one law and his heir to another, for if the guardian
should not produce the inventory and other documents demanded, the oath in
court can be admitted against him; and the same rule applies to his heir, if he
has found the documents among the papers of the estate, and fraudulently
refuses to produce them. But as you allege that as proceedings were instituted
against the guardian himself, they must be transferred by you against his
heirs; and, unless the documents in question are produced, the Governor of the
province must perform his duty, being well aware what it is as prescribed by
the terms of the constitutions.
Given on the seventh of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of Pius and
Pontianus, 239.
5. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Artemidorus.
Although it has been decided that, in an action of guardianship, the oath
should not be taken against the heirs for the reason that they have not made
the inventory, still, it is proper for the judge to render a decision against
them after having ascertained by other evidence that fraud has been committed
by the guardian.
Given at Nicomedia, on the eighth of the Kalendsof January, under the Consulate
of the Csesars, 294.
TITLE LIV. CONCERNING THE HEIRS OF GUARDIANS OR CURATORS.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Fuscianus.
The heirs of a guardian should not be held liable for his neglect, which is not
comparable to gross negligence, if proceedings were not instituted against him,
as they have neither profited by the loss of the ward, nor have done nothing by
way of favor.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Lateranus and
Rufinus, 198.
2. The Emperor Antoninus to Valentine and Maternus.
Your father, having been appointed a guardian or curator, and not having been
excused, you can, none the less, as his heirs, be sued in an equitable action
or one on guardianship, although you allege that he did not administer the
guardianship or curatorship; for lia-
bility exists on account of his failure to administer the same. It has,
however, frequently been stated in rescripts that proceedings should first be
instituted for their acts against those who administered the trust.
Given on the eleventh of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of
Antoninus, Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
3. The Same to Vita.
Proceed against the heirs of your former guardian by an action of guardianship,
and whatever he was liable to you for on account of being a surety, will also
be included in the action.
Given on the third of the Nonesof July, during the Consulate of Antoninus,
Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
4. The Emperor Alexander to Frontimis.
The heirs of those who have administered a guardianship or curatorship are
required to restore whatever may have come into their hands which forms part of
the property of the ward or the minor. There is also no doubt that an account
should be rendered of whatever the guardian or curator should have
administered, but did not.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of
Alexander, Consul for the third time, and Dio, 230.
TITLE LV. WHEN A GUARDIAN OR A CURATOR DOES NOT ACT.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Zodicus.
It is certain that not only those who administered the affairs of a
guardianship, but also those who ought to have done so, and did not, will be
liable in an action of guardianship for what could not be recovered from their
fellow-guardians, for the reason that they failed to have them declared
suspicious when they should have done so.
Moreover, although you could not bring an action involving infamy against your
patron, you still were able to provide that you should lose nothing by the
administration of the guardianship, by making the necessary application to the
court having jurisdiction of such matters.
Given on the second of the Idesof December, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and ^Elianus, 224.
2. The Same to Justus.
Where persons do not interfere in the affairs of a guardianship or curatorship,
they are not liable when those guardians or curators who have administered the
guardianship are solvent. If, however, they have failed to perform certain acts
which they should have performed, all will be equally liable for gross
negligence.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Julian,
Consul for the second time, and Crispinus, 225.
TITLE LVI. CONCERNING INTEREST BELONGING TO WARDS.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Crescentina.
It was long ago settled that a gu'ardian or curator who has employed the money
of his ward for his own benefit will be liable for legal interest on the same.
Given on the Nonesof June, during the Consulate of Antoninus, Consul for the
fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
2. The Emperor Alexander to Ampliatus.
There is no doubt that interest should be paid on what is due on account of the
guardianship, although payment is required for what is due from a fellow-
guardian who is insolvent, as this would not have happened if the removal of
the guardian had been accomplished by means of a statement that he was liable
to suspicion.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Julian,
Consul for the second time, and Crispinus, 225.
3. The Same to Vitalius.
If you have not been able to lend the money belonging to your ward to persons
who are solvent, or employ it in the purchase of land, the judge will know that
interest on said money cannot be collected from you.
Given on the Idesof April, during the Consulate of Modestus and Probus, 229.
4. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Ditatius and
Aurelius.
Your ward cannot be compelled to bring an action of guardianship against you,
but if you owe him anything, try to bring him into court by frequently serving
notice upon him, so that interest may not run on what you owe; and if, through
dissimulation, he protracts the affair, file your statement in writing before
the Governor of the province. In this way, you will provide for your own
security, as well as that for your children. This also applies to curators.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of the
Csesars, 293.
TITLE LVII.
CONCERNING THE SURETIES OR GUARDIANS AND CURATORS.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Felix.
You must choose whether you will proceed against the guardians or curators
themselves, their heirs, or those who became their sureties ; or you can divide
your action if you prefer to do so; for suit
cannot be brought against a defendant and his sureties for the entire amount,
at the same time.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of Julian,
Consul for the second time, and Crispinus, 225.
2. The Same to Priscus.
It is a certain rule of law that if the principal is chosen to be sued, and is
solvent, the surety will be released, and therefore if the surety is merely
accepted for the amount for which the guardian or curator will be liable (as
you state that the guardian or curator having had judgment rendered against him
has made payment), how can any doubt arise as to the release of the surety? If,
however, any stipulation has been entered into with reference to the integrity
of the property of the ward, or security has been given for anything which
cannot be made good by the guardian or curator, the surety will remain bound to
make up the deficiency.
Given on the seventh of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Fuscus,
Consul for the second time, and Dexter, 226.
TITLE LVIII. CONCERNING THE COUNTER ACTION OP GUARDIANSHIP.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Strata.
If you have paid a sum of money for your fellow-guardian, after judgment has
been rendered against you, no action will lie in your favor against the ward to
compel him to assign his right of action to you against him who has been
released by your having made payment. Where, however, you have purchased the
claim, having been appointed attorney in your own behalf, you can bring an
action to enforce judgment against the heirs of the person for whom you made
payment.
Given on the second of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Fabian and
Mutianus, 202.
2. The Emperor Antoninus to Primitivus.
If you, through no fault of your own, have had judgment rendered against you in
favor of your female ward, and while absent and undefended you acquiesced in
the decision, as you have taken measures to satisfy the judgment, you can have
her rights of action against your fellow-guardian assigned to you by your ward,
or you can avail yourself of the praetorian action.
Given on the second of the Idesof October, during the Consulate of the two
Aspers, 213.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Thesis.
If your father, whom you allege administered the estate of his step-son, died
after having executed a will according to law, and by it appointed his former
ward his heir, as it is established that a claim
for the hereditary share of the guardianship has not been extinguished by
merger, it will be proper for you as the co-heir of your father to render an
account for the remaining portion of the guardianship before a competent judge.
In accordance with the requirements of good faith, set-off will be admitted for
the amount which you allege your father expended for the benefit of his ward,
and if, after this, any more is due, you will be obliged to pay it. Where,
however, being aware that more has been expended for his benefit than you are
liable for, he does not think that an action of guardianship should be brought
on this ground, you can sue him in a contrary action.
Given on the eighteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 294.
. TITLE LIX.
CONCERNING THE AUTHORITY WHICH SHOULD BE GRANTED BY A GUARDIAN OR CURATOR.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Antoniamis.
The absence of neither the guardian nor curator will prejudice, in any way, a
stipulation made in behalf of a ward or a minor.
Given without date, during the Consulate of the above-mentioned Emperors.
2. The Same Emperors and C&sars to Serena.
By releasing them while you were a minor without the authority of your
guardian, you can, by no means, lose your right of action.
Given on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 293.
3. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Gaius.
The prescription of long time does not protect anyone who has purchased
something from a ward without the authority of his guardian.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the
Csesars, 293.
4. The Emperor Justinian to John, Prtetorian Prefect.
In order to make Our statement clear to posterity, We order that guardians or
curators must, by all means, be present when minors under the age of twenty-
five years either institute criminal proceedings, or are defendants under
circumstances where the laws permit minors and wards to be accused, as it is
more prudent and better that minors should make their defences or prosecute
their cases with the full advice of their guardians, in order that they may not
either say or suppress anything through their want of experience or juvenile
impetuosity, which, if it had been stated on the one hand, or not
mentioned on the other, might have been of advantage to them, or have prevented
them from being injured.
Given at Constantinople, on the tenth of the Kalendsof March, after the fifth
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
5. The Same to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
Desiring to remove all doubt which formerly existed as to whether a single
testamentary guardian, or one appointed after investigation, could act by his
sole authority (even though there were several guardians who were not appointed
for different places), or whether all those who were legally or judicially
appointed could be compelled to give their consent, We order that where several
guardians have been appointed either by the will of the father, or called by
law, or named by the judge either after an investigation or without ceremony,
the consent of one guardian alone shall be sufficient, where the administration
is not divided either by localities, or by portions of the estate. For it is
necessary for each one to give his consent to the ward with reference to the
part of the estate, or the locality for which he has been designated, and We
order that, in this respect, testamentary guardians shall not differ from those
appointed after investigation, or such as are called by law, for which reason
they are all equally obliged to furnish security, and a subsidiary action in
favor of their wards will lie against them.
These provisions, however, must be understood only to be applicable where the
dissolution of the guardianship is involved, as, for instance, where the ward
desires to give himself in arrogation; for it would be absurd if the
guardianship should be abolished, not only without the consent, but perhaps
without the knowledge of the person appointed. For then, whether the guardians
are designated by will, or after investigation, or whether they are called by
law or appointed without ceremony, it is necessary for all of them to consent,
so that what concerns them all may be approved by all. These provisions must
likewise be observed with reference to curators.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof September, after the fifth Consulate
of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
TITLE LX.
WHEN GUARDIANS OR CURATORS CEASE TO DISCHARGE THE DUTIES OF THEIR OFFICE.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Hernula.
When curators are added to guardians, it is perfectly clear that the duties of
both are terminated by the arrival of the minor at the age of puberty, and
therefore that other curators should be appointed on account of the weakness
attaching to the age of the minors.
Given at Rome, on the fourth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of
Antoninus, Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Menippus.
It is perfectly evident that the duties of a guardian cannot be terminated
merely by the will of the ward.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 292.
3. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Prsetorian Prefect.
Abolishing the indecent examination established for the purpose of ascertaining
the puberty of males, We order that just as females are considered to have
arrived at puberty after having completed their twelfth year, so, likewise,
males shall be held to have arrived at that age after having passed their
fourteenth year, and the disgraceful examination of the bodies of such persons
is hereby terminated.
Given at Constantinople, on the eighth of the Idesof April, during the
Consulate of Decius, 529.
TITLE LXI.
CONCERNING THE APPOINTMENT OP AN AGENT BY A GUARDIAN OR CURATOR.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Alphocratio.
If your children, who are their own masters, have succeeded their mother,
although it may be shown that you were their guardian, still it is settled that
you may petition for their affairs to be managed during your absence, not by an
attorney, but by an agent appointed by you under a decree.
Given on the Nonesof January, during the Consulate of the Caesars, 293.
TITLE LXII.
CONCERNING THE EXCUSES OF GUARDIANS AND CURATORS AND WHEN THEY MAY BE OFFERED.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Aviola.
You are laboring under an erroneous idea when you think that because you are an
eunuch you are exempt from performing the duties of guardianship.
Given on the Kalendsof May, under the Consulate of Chilo and Libo, 205.
2. The Same to Habentianus and Cosconius.
If you have been appointed curators in general terms, and it has not been
mentioned in the decree that you are only to discharge your duties in Italy,
you should go before a competent judge and obtain your release from
administration in the province. If this should be
done, the minors can petition to have curators appointed for them in the
province.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of Chilo
and Libo, 205.
3. The Same to Crispinus.
It is certain that if you, being freeborn, have been appointed guardian of a
freedman, you can be excused, but as the Governor of the province did not think
that you should be heard because your application was barred by prescription,
as you applied to him too late, and did not appeal from this decision, you are
advised that you must comply
with it.
Given on the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Albinus and
JElianus, 207.
4. The Emperor Antoninus to Agathus Demon.
It has been established by a Decree of the Senate that anyone who marries his
female ward is understood to contract an illegal marriage, and will be branded
with infamy. If, however, you, while absent and ignorant of the fact, were
appointed the curator of Demetria, to whom you were married, you can rest
secure, provided someone is substituted in your stead; for the ignorance of a
husband should not be considered as fraud under the Decree of the Senate.
Given on the eleventh of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Sabinus
and JSmilianus, 207.
5. The Emperor Alexander to Basilius.
The illustrious order of the Senate, at the suggestion of the Divine Marcus,
decreed that freedmen could, under no circumstances, be excused from the
guardianship or curatorship of the children of their patron or patroness;
therefore, it would be of no advantage to them to allege that they have been
appointed curators for said children, against the consent of their patron or
patroness, in order to avoid administering the guardianship of said children.
6. The Same to Maximian.
The same constitution which established the term of fifty days, within which
persons who have been appointed guardians or curators can excuse themselves,
also provided that the time shall run from the date when the decree of the
Praetor or the will of the father was brought to the attention of the person
appointed to discharge this duty. If, however, anyone, after the time when
notice was served upon him, should be unjustly treated by the court, and does
not appeal, he must comply with the decision.
Given on the third of the Nonesof May, during the Consulate of Julian, Consul
for the second time, and Crispinus, 225.
7. The Same to Antoninus.
No one is excused from guardianship or curatorship for the reason! that he is
either a creditor or a debtor of the person for whom he has]
been appointed; but he ought to have an associate, so that, if circumstances
should demand it, the minor who needs the assistance of others may be
protected.
Given on the third of the Idesof July, during the Consulate of Julian, Consul
for the second time, and Crispinus, 225.
8. The Same to Maximus.
Tenants, that is to say, the lessees of lands belonging to the Treasury, cannot
allege this as an excuse for exemption from civil functions, and therefore they
should discharge the duties of guardianship imposed upon them.
Given on the fourth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of Fuscus
and Dexter, 226.
9. The Same to Romanus.
Your brother should not be excused from guardianship or curator-ship for the
reason that he has lost an eye, hence you understand that he cannot avoid the
duty imposed upon him.
Given on the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of Modes-tus and Probus,
229.
10. The Same to Crispinus.
You should have had no doubt that collectors of taxes while performing their
duties are exempt, not only from civil charges, but also from guardianship.
Given on the Idesof August, during the Consulate of Alexander, Consul for the
third time, and Dio, 230.
11. The Same to Hylas.
You, having been appointed a testamentary guardian, should have applied within
fifty days to be excused from the administration of the property of your ward,
which is situated in another province from the one in which you are, and where
you reside. If you failed to do this, your application to be excused will be
barred by prescription; but if the Governor of the province is of the opinion
that you are not capable of administering the property, on account of its being
widely scattered, he will provide for curators to be joined with you in the
management of the same.
Given on the eighth of the Idesof December, during the Consulate of Pompeianus
and Pelignus, 232.
12. The Emperor Gordian to Valentine.
Voluntary acceptance of guardianship does, in no way, deprive a person of the
privileges to which he is entitled.
Given on the eleventh of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of Pius
and Pontianus, 239.
13. The Same to Apollinarus.
Neither the freedman of senators or others are exempt from civil charges merely
for the reason that they are transacting the business
of their patrons. The freedman of a senator, however, who is transacting the
affairs of his patron, may be excused from guardianship or curatorship.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of Gordian
and Aviola, 240.
14. The Same to Heraclida.
The Governor of the province must severely punish the magistrates who appointed
your uncle guardian, if he should ascertain that this has been done with the
expectation of his paying them money to be excused from performing his duties.
Hence if he is entitled to any excuse, and can show that he has not been
nominated for any other reason than to be annoyed by a lawsuit, he who
appointed him shall, in compliance with the terms of the constitution, be
required to return to him everything which he has expended in the proceedings.
Given on the Idesof September, during the Consulate of Gordian and Aviola, 240.
15. The Same to Taurus.
Although you have been retained in the guardianship because the excuse which
you offered was not accepted, and you have had recourse to an appeal, and, in
the meantime, the persons whom you mentioned have reached the age of puberty,
the examination of the appeal must, nevertheless, proceed in the manner
prescribed by law, on account of the risk attending the administration of the
trust.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of Arian
and Pappus, 244.
16. The Emperor Philip to Theodotus.
If (as you state) you have been appointed guardian of those with whom you have
a dispute concerning an estate, and, the time formerly prescribed within which
your excuse must be offered has not yet expired, you can appear before the
Governor of the province, who will render a decision in compliance with the
Decrees of the Emperors according to the importance of the case.
Given on the tenth' of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Peregrinus
and .ZEmilianus, 245.
17. The Emperors Gallienus and Valerian to Epagathus.
Although the question is not specifically mentioned in an Address of the Divine
Marcus on this subject, still, he who has been appointed curator of his
daughter-in-law after the marriage has taken place, should be excused, lest he
may act contrary to the terms of the said address and be guilty of want of
propriety.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof January, during the Consulate of Valerian,
Consul for the second time, and Lucian, 266.
18. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Sabinus and
Others.
It is a positive rule of law that guardians are not required to appeal after
having been appointed. Therefore, although you have not appealed, still, if you
think that you have a good excuse, you will not be prevented from presenting it
to the Governor of the province within the time prescribed by the Constitution
of the Divine Marcus. For the fact that the father of your ward has left the
usufruct of all his property to his former wife, as you allege, will not be
sufficient to release you from the guardianship.
Given on the Nonesof April, during the Consulate of the Caesars.
19. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Dionysius.
You desire something unusual when you petition to be excused from the
guardianship of a son, for the reason that you contend that his mother can sue
you by the contrary action of guardianship.
Without date or designation of consulate.
20. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Cratinus.
If you have been appointed the curator of minors whose guardian you previously
were, you cannot be required to administer the curator-ship against your will.
Hence, if the time prescribed for offering excuses has not yet expired, you can
make use of a proper defence.
Given at Nicomedia, on the tenth of the Kalendsof December, during the
Consulate of the Csesars.
21. The Same Emperors and Caesars to Parammon.
You have not a valid excuse for being released from guardianship, because you
allege that you hold property in common with your uterine brothers, as a
division of it can be made by the appointment of a curator.
Given at Nicomedia on the eighteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the
Consulate of the Csesars.
22. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Hermodorus.
If, after having been appointed guardian, your excuse has been admitted by the
Decree of the Governor, you will be released, for it is clear that no
responsibility for the administration will attach to you.
Given at Nicomedia, on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the
Consulate of the Csesars.
23. The Same Emperors and Ctesars to Neophytus.
The principles of humanity and affection do not permit you to be compelled to
bring suit against your sister or her children, on account of matters connected
with the guardianship, as the welfare of the ward himself, of whom you have
been appointed guardian, appears to require another course, that is to say,
that he should have a guardian who will not be prevented from conducting his
defence through affection for his adversary. Therefore, in accordance with the
rule which We
have formulated after having been consulted, you must go before the Praetor and
he will act in accordance with your wishes, as well as for the welfare of your
ward.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of Tuscus
and Amulinus, 295.
24. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Flavian, Prastorian Prefect.
We have, up to this time, granted exemption from guardianship or curatorship to
the owners of vessels, so that they are only required to serve in this capacity
where the minors belong to their association.
Given at Milan, on the third of the Nonesof March, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
25. The Emperor Anastasius to Antiochus, Imperial Chamberlain.
We order that the illustrious men belonging to Our Imperial palace, known as
silentiarii,shall be exempt from guardianship and curator-ship while in
attendance on Our person.
Given on the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of John and Asclepio, 300.
TITLE LXIII.
WHERE A GUARDIAN OR CURATOR HAS BEEN EXCUSED BY MEANS OF FALSE ALLEGATIONS.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Symmachus and Diotimus.
If, during the absence of your relatives or of those who have volunteered to
defend you, the person appointed your guardians or curators have caused
themselves to be released from the discharge of their duties by means of
improper allegations, in order that they may not profit by having deceived the
judge, the Governor of the province shall hear you, and if it appears that they
have extorted an unjust decree, he shall decide that they must assume the
responsibility for the administration from the time of their appointment.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and ^Elianus, 214.
2. The Emperor Philip and the Csesar Philip to Aulizanus.
It is clear that the guardians whom you assert have, after administering the
property of their wards, obtained their release from the Governor of the
province just as if they had done nothing with reference to the guardianship,
they can, by no means, avoid responsibility for the administration.
Given on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of Philip
and Titian, 246.
3. The Same Emperors and C&ssars to Octavius.If (as you allege) the other party
has been excused from the administration of the guardianship or curatorship of
your brother and
yourself, rather through favor than for any lawful reason, he will not be
released from liability for the charge imposed upon him. Without date or
designation of consulate.
TITLE LXIV.
WHERE A GUARDIAN OR CURATOR is ABSENT ON BUSINESS FOR THE STATE.
1. The Emperor Gordian to Guttius.
Those who have been appointed guardians or curators, and are about to be absent
on public business, should have themselves excused for the time, in order that
they may not be held liable in the meanwhile. Therefore, if you have done this,
you ought not to be apprehensive of being called to account for the time during
which you were absent. If, however, you have neglected to do so, demand in
court that the person who administered the trust in your absence be sued first.
Given on the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Gordian and Aviola, 240.
2. The Same to Reginius.
It is certain that those guardians who have ceased to discharge their duties on
account of being absent on business for the State ought to be exempt for an
entire year following their return.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Gordian,
Consul for the second time, and Pompeianus, 242.
TITLE LXV. CONCERNING THE EXCUSES OF VETERANS.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Saturninus.
Those who have been honorably discharged after having served in the army for
twenty years, and retain their reputations untarnished, shall enjoy the
privileges conceded to veterans.
Given on the seventh of the Idesof August, during the Consulate of Antoninus,
Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
2. The Emperor Gordian to the Veteran Celer.
Although it has been decided that veterans can only be compelled to administer
the guardianship or curatorship of the sons of their fellow-veterans, or of
soldiers, and only one of these at a time, still, if they should be appointed
the guardians or curators of others, they must present their excuses before a
competent judge within the time prescribed by law.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Gordian and
Aviola, 240.
TITLE LXVI.
CONCERNING THOSE WHO ARE EXCUSED ON ACCOUNT OF THE NUMBER OF THEIR CHILDREN.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Herodian.
Those who are appointed guardians or curators, and have three children at Rome,
concerning whose condition no doubt exists, or four in Italy, or five in the
provinces, have a right to be excused.
Given on the Nonesof April, during the Consulship of Geta and Plautianus, 204.
2. The Emperor Antoninus to Marcellus.
A deceased daughter is of no advantage to anyone for the purpose of declining
the acceptance of a municipal office, nor shall any grandchildren be counted
whose father is living, as they only benefit a father in a case of this kind.
Given on the Idesof June, during the Consulate of Antoninus, Consul for the
fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
TITLE LXVII.
CONCERNING THOSE WHO ARE EXCUSED ON ACCOUNT OF
ILLNESS.
1. The Emperor Philip, and the Czesar Philip, to Sabinus.
Anyone who is blind, deaf, dumb, insane, or is suffering from an incurable
chronic disease, has a valid excuse for declining a guardianship or
curatorship.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of
Praesens and Albinus, 247.
TITLE LXVIII. WHO CAN BE EXCUSED ON ACCOUNT OF AGE.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Severus.
If your father is over seventy years of age, and is appointed either a guardian
or a curator, he can legally be excused.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof September, during the Consulate of Chilo and
Libo, 205.
TITLE LXIX.
WHO CAN BE EXCUSED ON ACCOUNT OF THE NUMBER OF GUARDIANSHIPS.
1. The Emperor Severus and Antoninus to Pompeianus.If you are administering
three guardianships or curatorships at the same time, which you have not
undertaken without due considera-
tion, you shall not be oppressed with the responsibility of a fourth
guardianship or curatorship of guardians or minors. Where, however, your duties
have been terminated by the arrival of the wards at the age of puberty, or the
minors at majority, other trusts can be substituted for them, whose
administration you will be obliged to assume, even though you may not yet have
rendered your accounts of that of the former guardianships or curatorships.
Different kinds of excuses which are not well grounded, although they may be
mingled with good ones, are of no avail in obtaining a release; therefore you
should know that he who has two children and is administering two guardianships
is not entitled to be released from another to which he has been appointed.
Given on the fourth of the Idesof October, during the second Consulate of
Antoninus and Geta, 206.
TITLE LXX.
CONCERNING THE CURATOR OP AN INSANE PERSON OR A SPENDTHRIFT.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Mariniana.
It is customary for curators to be appointed for spendthrifts and insane
persons, though they may have attained their majority.
Given on the fourth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Messala
and Sabinus, 215.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Avitius.
The benefit of the Rescript of the Divine Severus, by which the rustic estates
of wards or minors are forbidden to be sold or encumbered without a decree of
the Governor, does not cause any injury to the agnates of an insane person.
Hence, if a tract of land belonging to a person who has lost his mind is
encumbered to you by one of his agnates, by way of pledge, contrary to the
Decree of the Governor, the obligation of pledge with reference to it, will
stand; but you will have the right to an equitable personal action against him,
if the money which was loaned was employed for his benefit.
Given on the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of Pius and Pontianus,
239.
3. The Same to Aurelia.
If your father is not sane, petition to have curators appointed for him, by
means of whom, if any business he transacted should be revoked, after proper
examination, matters may be restored to their former condition.
Given on the seventh of the Idesof April, during the Consulate of Gordian and
Aviola, 240.
4. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Asclepiodotus.As you allege that the
mother of an insane woman, who is her own mistress, and repudiated her husband,
who alone had the right to
repudiate her, executed, along with him, certain instruments relating to the
affairs of her daughter, you are informed that she could not do anything
contrary to the interests of the said insane person, because she has legally no
right to represent her.
Given at Byzantium, during the Idesof April, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors.
5. The Emperor Anastasius to the People.
In order that We may not appear to have intended to unduly benefit an
emancipated brother or brothers, in their succession to other brothers, without
imposing upon them the burdens of guardianship, We decree by the terms of this
law that, notwithstanding the provision of the Twelve Tables concerning the
appointment of curators, they can legally be appointed for their insane
brothers and sisters.
6. The Emperor Justinian to Julian, Prietorian Prefect.
It sometimes happens that the affliction of insane men remains continuous, and
with others the attacks of disease are suspended, and lucid intervals occur,
and in this latter instance a great difference exists, for some of the lucid
intervals are short, and others are of long duration. In former times the
question arose whether the authority of the curator continued to exist during
the lucid intervals of insanity, when it temporarily ceased, and when the
disease returned, it was restored. Hence We, desiring to decide this doubtful
point, do hereby decree that, as when insane persons of this kind recover their
senses it is uncertain and impossible to determine whether this will endure for
a long or for a short period, and as the parties in question frequently remain
on the border line of insanity and health, and after they continue for a
considerable time in this condition, the lunacy seems in some cases to be
removed, We decree that the appointment of the curator shall not be considered
as ended, but to exist as long as the insane person lives, for generally a
disease of this kind is incurable; and We also decree that, during their
perfectly lucid intervals, the curator shall not exercise his authority, and
that the demented person, while he is temporarily in possession of his senses,
can enter upon an estate and do everything else which sane men are competent to
do.
If, however, he should again become insane, the curator must intervene in his
affairs, so that everything may be done in the name of the latter, as often as
the disease returns, in order that the appointment of a curator may not be made
frequently, or in such a way as to be ridiculous, and seem to be appointed as
often as he is required to cease to exercise his functions.
Given on the Kalendsof September, during the fifth Consulate of Lampadius and
Orestes, 530.
7. The Same to Julian, Prsetorian Prefect.
An insane person, who remains constantly under the care of his parents,
undoubtedly cannot have a curator, for paternal solicitude is sufficient for
the management of his property, which he obtained as
castrense peculium,or from other sources, whether he acquired it before he
became insane, or whether it came into his hands while he was in that
condition; and this also applies to the cases of those who have only the mere
ownership of property. For where can such affection as influences a father be
found in a stranger? Or to whom is the authority of managing the property of
children to be entrusted, if their parents are excluded? Although Tertullian,
the interpreter of the ancient law, in the single book which he wrote on
castrense peculium,appears to have discussed this point in an obscure manner,
We now have stated it with perfect clearness.
(1) When, however, the parents of an insane person happen to die, Our
Constitution, which We have promulgated with reference to what should be left
to an insane person by will, as well as concerning the substitution which can
be made on his account, shall remain in full force.
(2) But where a man incurably insane is legally his own master, there is no
doubt that, under the ancient law, he can share in the estate of his father
which has been left to his children, when it plainly appears that he is a
proper heir of his parents.
(3) If, however, for any cause, another inheritance or succession should
descend to him, then a great and inexplicable doubt arose under the ancient law
whether, while still insane, he should be admitted to enter upon the estate, or
demand praetorian possession of the same, or not; and whether his curator could
be permitted to demand praetorian possession of the estate. An important
discussion on both sides of this question took place among jurists. Hence We,
for the purpose of reconciling the authorities, do hereby decree that an insane
person can, under no circumstances, accept an estate or obtain praetorian
possession of it; but We grant permission to his curator, nay more, We require
him, if he should think that the succession would be advantageous, to accept
the prsetorian possession of the estate which resembles that formerly granted
by a decree, as the demand for it was abolished by a law of the Emperor
Constantine, by which a new proceeding was introduced which took the place of
the ancient application.
(4) As the ancients established many regulations with reference to the
appointment of a curator of an insane person, for example, in what manner a
bond or security should be furnished by him with reference to certain property
and certain persons, as they were in doubt whether every curator should furnish
the same security, it appears necessary to Us, having a view to the interests
of the human race, to remove all this obscurity and inextricable confusion, and
provide for the entire matter a complete and luminous remedy. And as We first
issued a decree authorizing the appointment of a curator for insane persons of
both sexes, We now proceed to the consideration and removal of other
difficulties.
(5) Where a father, in his last will, by which he either appointed or
disinherited his heirs, designated a curator for an insane son or daughter,
when it is necessary for security to be given, the will of the father is
sufficient, and the person appointed shall obtain the curator-
ship, provided that, in this most flourishing City he appears before the
Prefect of the same, and in a province before its Governor in the presence of
the most pious bishop of the diocese and his three coadjutors, and, having
placed his hands on the most Holy Gospels, he declares that he will conduct all
the affairs of the said insane person lawfully and for his benefit, and that he
will not omit anything which he may think to be for his welfare, or permit
anything to be done which he believes will be to his disadvantage.
Extract from, Novel 72, Last Chapter. Latin Text.Generally speaking, this oath
is required of all curators, but they are not exempt from rendering accounts.
The same rule applies to
guardians.
END OP THE EXTRACT.
THE TEXT OF THE CODE FOLLOWS.
The curator shall undertake the administration of the estate after an inventory
has been publicly drawn up with all the requisite formalities, and he can
dispose of said estate as he may desire, his own property being hypothecated as
security for his administration, as in the case of the guardians and curators
of minors.
(6) If, however, the father did not execute a will, and the law calls an agnate
as the curator, or if there is none, or a suitable one does not exist, it will
be necessary for a curator to be appointed by the court; and in this instance,
the appointment shall be made according to the aforesaid division, in this most
nourishing City before the most distinguished Urban Prefect, but if the said
insane person is of noble birth, the Senate must be called together, and, after
investigation, a curator of the best reputation and the highest integrity shall
be appointed. Where no such person can be found, the appointment shall be made
under the sole direction of the most distinguished Urban Prefect.
Where the curator is the possessor of a considerable amount of property, this
will suffice for the faithful management of his trust, and his appointment can
be made without his being obliged to furnish security. If, however, it should
be ascertained that he does not possess sufficient property, then the best
security possible shall be required of him; and in every instance his
appointment shall, by all means, be made with his hands placed on the Most Holy
Scriptures.
The curator himself, no matter what his wealth or rank may be, must take the
aforesaid oath to properly manage the affairs of the trust, and draw up a
public inventory, in order that all the estate of the insane person may be
everywhere administered as well as possible. In the appointment of the above-
mentioned curator all these formalities must be observed in the provinces
before the Governor of the same, and the most reverend bishop of the diocese,
and his three coadjutors. The regulations concerning the appointment, the oath,
and the inventory, the security, and the hypothecation of the property of the
curator, must by all means be complied with.
(7) When the curator of an insane person has been appointed in this manner, and
the said insane person afterwards becomes entitled to any property either by
inheritance, succession, legacy, trust, or from any other source whatsoever, it
shall be added to his estate, and, together with the remainder, be given into
the hands of the curator, he of course making an inventory of all said
property, and it shall remain in his charge; but if the insane person should
afterwards recover his senses, and approve of the acquisition of said property,
it shall be restored to him.
(8) If, however, the insane person should die in that condition, or, having
recovered his senses, should reject the property, for example it should be an
inheritance, it will go to those who have been substituted for him if they are
willing to accept it, or to the heirs at law, and in their default, to Our
Treasury. It must, however, be observed that those persons are entitled to the
succession who were the next of kin to the insane person at the time of his
death, provided that, when they are called to the succession, the person has
not in the meantime been insane. All securities or bonds which the authorities
of the ancient law introduced, and which have caused inextricable confusion,
are hereby absolutely abolished. All legacies, trusts, and other acquisitions
obtained by the insane person should undoubtedly be added to the remainder of
his estate.
(9) If, however, he should recover his senses, and be unwilling to accept the
property, and should openly reject it, or his heirs should do the same thing,
it must at once be separated from the remainder of his estate, just as if it
had never belonged to it in the first place, and should pass by lawful descent
in such a way as to neither be a disadvantage nor a benefit to the estate of
the said insane person.
(10) If, however, the curator of the insane person who was appointed in
accordance with the provisions of Our laws should die, another shall be
appointed in the same manner and with the same formalities, just as if the
first one had been found to be liable to suspicion, and the other was
subrogated to him. This rule, also, was established by the ancient laws.
(11) All these regulations relating to the appointment of curators which have
been introduced by this new law are applicable to future cases, and any
curators which have previously been appointed shall not be removed on account
of it; nor shall any new restrictions be imposed upon them, but, having been
appointed under the ancient law, its rules having reference to their
appointment shall remain unaltered. No bond or security formerly required in
the succession to which insane persons are entitled shall be furnished.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof September, during the fifth Consulate
of Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
TITLE LXXI.
LANDS AND OTHER PROPERTY BELONGING TO MINORS SHALL NOT BE ALIENATED OR
ENCUMBERED WITHOUT A
DECREE.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Minutianus.
The sale of a tract of land made on account of its having been pledged and in
pursuance of a judicial decision is not included in the Decree of the Senate
which provides that the real property of wards or minors shall not be
alienated, unless this is done by the authority of the Prsetor or Governor of
the province. If, however, you are of such an age as to be entitled to relief,
having applied to a competent judge, he will order that complete restitution be
given you, after having examined the case in the presence of the adverse party.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the
two Aspers, 213.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Clearchus and Others.
It is not necessary for you to demand complete restitution, if your guardians
or curators have sold the property without the authority of a decree, even
though it may have been hypothecated. If, however, the creditors did this, you
will be entitled to the benefit of the Edict, if the sale was fraudulent, and
it is shown that you have sustained injury with the connivance of the
purchaser.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of Gordian
and Aviola, 240.
3. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus to Theodosius and Others.
As the property which you acquired after you were emancipated could not have
been alienated by your father as your curator, without the authority of the
Governor, especially if the said property was sold by him as his, and not as
belonging to you, you have a right to recover
it by law.
Given on the third of the Nonesof January, during the Consulate
of Tuscus and Bassus, 259.
4. The Same to Mithridates.
Neither urban estates nor property in a city can be sold or alienated by wards
or minors, and it cannot be transferred from their ownership either by means of
set-off or exchange, and much less by gift, or in any other way, without a
decree of court. Hence, if you have conveyed a tract of land to your brothers
by way of set-off, you can bring suit to recover it, and if, on the other hand,
you have obtained anything from them under the same contract, you should return
it.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Secularis,
Consul for the second time, and Donatus, 261.
5. The Same to Serenus.
Although the Governor decided that an urban or rustic estate belonging to a
ward could be alienated or encumbered, still, the Senate
reserved a right of action in favor of the ward if he could prove that the
judge had been deceived by false allegations, and you also are not forbidden to
institute proceedings of this kind.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Secularis,
Consul for the second time, and Donatus, 261.
6. The Emperors Cams, Carinus, and Numerianus to Varus.
The sale of the real property of minors cannot be made through an application
made by an attorney to the Prastor, or the Governor of a province, as this
cannot legally take place unless documents are produced before either of the
above-mentioned officials, which show the necessity of the sale, and a decree
to that effect is formally issued.
Given on the Nonesof May, under the Consulate of Carus and Carinus, 283.
7. The Same Emperors to Isidor.
If, while you were a minor under the age of twenty-five years, you executed a
bond to your father for the return of a donation which he made to you when you
were emancipated, as an instrument of this kind is in violation of the Decree
of the Senate, it will not prejudice your rights.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof December, during the Consulate of Carus and
Carinus, 283.
8. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Theodota.
It is clear that the ownership of the rustic estates which', in violation of
the Decree of the Senate, were given to you before marriage as a betrothal gift
(this having been done at your request) cannot be transferred to you, as this
has been prohibited by law, they will remain part of the property of your
husband.
Given on the third of the Nonesof November, during the Consulate of Diocletian
and Aristobolus, 285.
9. The Same Emperors to Mutianus.
Although he who you allege sold the rustic estate of a minor did so at the time
when he was acting as curator, the sale having been made contrary to the terms
of the Rescript of the Divine Severus, it was very properly set aside by the
decision of the Governor. You will not, however, be prevented from claiming the
pledges of his own property which the curator encumbered as a guarantee against
eviction.
Given during the Nonesof November, during the Consulate of Diocletian and
Aristobolus, 285.
10. The Same to Gratits.
The Governor will grant you relief in your claim for the ownership of lands
which were alienated without the authority of a decree, and if he should
ascertain that the entire amount of the purchase-money paid to your curator was
not added to your property, he will allow you to
be sued only for that amount which may be proved to have been expended for your
benefit, or added to your estate.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof August, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors.
11. The Same to Trophinus.
If your patron, who is a minor, sold your rustic estate without the authority
of a judicial decision, it is unnecessary to mention the low price at which it
was sold, as the Decree of the Senate prohibits an alienation of this kind, and
the title does not pass. If, however, acting under the authority of a decree,
he sold the said land at a very low price, he being ignorant of the true value
of the same, complete restitution in accordance with the terms of the Perpetual
Edict will, after proper investigation, be granted you.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
12. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Leontius.The rustic estate of a minor,
situated in a province, can only be sold on account of a debt after a decree of
the Governor has been
issued.
Given at Heraclea, on the second of the Kalendsof May, during the
Consulate of the Csesars.
13. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Zenophila.
It is not lawful for a rustic estate belonging to a minor, whether the same be
tributary, patrimonial, or emphyteutical, to be sold without a decree of the
Governor.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
14. The Same Emperors and Csssars to Phrominius.
Adopt the opinion of the most learned Papinianus and the other authorities whom
you have mentioned in your petition, and file an exception on the ground of bad
faith, if the wards demand the principal and interest which belongs to the
Treasury, and you can prove that they did not tender you the amount of the debt
paid on their account, and they claim the lands in the province which, with
their crops, were sold without the authority of a Decree of the Governor.
Given on the ninth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
15. The Same Emperors and Caesars to Sabina.
If, while you were a minor under the age of twenty-five years, you gave in
payment a certain rustic estate when you should have given another, the Decree
of the Senate does not permit you to be deprived of the ownership of the
property.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
 16. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Eutychia.
If, while you were a minor, you sold a rustic or urban estate (as not the
situation of the latter, but its nature, should be considered), and you did
this with the authority of your guardian, or, being beyond the age of puberty,
you acted without the Decree of the Governor of the province in which the
property was situated, by the terms of the Decree of the Senate you cannot be
deprived of its ownership or your rights to the same, but an action will lie in
your favor for its recovery, together with its crops, and if there are none of
the latter, you will be entitled to a personal action. If, however, the
purchaser can prove that he could not pay your expenses or discharge your
obligations out of his other property, and that besides the money received by
way of price has been entirely expended for your benefit, he can, by the aid of
an exception oh the ground of bad faith, contest your claim, until you repay
him the purchase-money and interest which you have received, as well as the
expenses which he has incurred for the improvement of the land.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof April, during the Consulate of the Csesars.
17. The Emperors and the Csesars to Philip.
The terms of the Decree of the Senate do not permit land held in common by
minors to be disposed of without a decision of the Governor of the province,
for it was long since settled that an alienation of such property cannot be
made without a judicial decree, except where the person having the largest
share demands a division of the same.
18. The Emperor Constantine and the Cassar Constantine to Severus.
Where minors, either in the name of their father or on their own account, are
oppressed with debts, whether they are due to the Treasury or to private
individuals, the Constantinian Prsetor, after having examined the case, shall
render a decree confirming the sale, if the truth of the allegations should be
established.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Probianus and Julian, 322.
TITLE LXXII. WHEN THERE is NO NEED OF A DECREE.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Valentinus.
If you can prove that the father of the ward, against whose guardians you have
brought suit, consented that the land should be transferred to you if he
received the price of the same, the agreement shall be observed. In this case,
the authority of the Governor is not necessary, as the interests of the
guardians will be protected if the latter conform to the will of the deceased.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of Antoninus
and Geta, 306.
2. The Emperor Aurelian to Pulcher.
It was necessary to ascertain whether the illustrious Saturninus, having
appeared before the Emperor, received a special right to make the sale, for the
consent of the Emperor takes the place of a decree of the Governor.
Given during the Idesof January ....
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Stratonicianus.
A rustic or an urban estate can, under no circumstances, be alienated by a
minor under the age of twenty-five years without a decree of the Governor,
unless a will of his father, or that of the testator whose estate has come into
the hands of the minor, is understood to have made provision for such
alienation.
Given at Nicomedia, on the twelfth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate
of the above-mentioned Emperors.
4. The Emperor Constantine to the People.
We permit the guardians and curators of persons of every description to sell
clothing which is worn, and superfluous animals, without the authority of a
decree.
Given on the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Constantine, Consul for the
seventh time, and the Caesar Constantius, Consul for the fourth time, 326.
TITLE LXXIII.
WHERE ANYONE, NOT BEING AWARE THAT PROPERTY BELONGS TO A MINOR, PURCHASES IT
WITHOUT A DECREE.
1. The Emperor Gordian to Felix.
If she who succeeded to the rights of the guardian, either by an hereditary or
a praetorian title, should sell your land as belonging to a ward, the purchaser
who knowingly bought it from the heir of the deceased guardian can acquire no
defence by prescription through the purchase of another's property. If,
however, the heir sold the property as his own, and the purchaser ignorantly
bought it as belonging to another, he does not immediately become the owner of
the land by delivery, but he can only make use of the defence of prescription
for the established time, as you do not deny that you are of lawful age.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof September, during the Consulate of Pius and
Pontianus, 239.
2. The Same to Crispina.
If your property has been sold contrary to the Decree of the Senate, bring suit
against the possessor of the same, so that if you can prove the fact, you may
recover possession, and all the profits may be restored to you, especially if
it is established that he who bought it is not a bona fidepurchaser.
Given on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof . . . , during the Consulate of
Gordian, Consul for the second time, and Pompeianus, 242.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Agatha.
Your rustic or urban estates which have been alienated contrary to the Decree
of the Senate, without investigation, or the promulgation of any decree, are
not legally held even by a second purchaser, unless the time fixed by law has
elapsed.
Given at Nicomedia on the Idesof February, during the Consulate of the Csesars.
4. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Alexander.
As the property in question was transferred as against the purchaser to him to
whom the property was donated contrary to the Decree of the Senate, and then
acquired by a lawful title, it must be ascertained whether the present owner
has held said property without dispute and in good faith for the term of ten
years, the former owner being present; or whether the latter being absent, the
defendant is shown to have been the undisputed possessor for the term of twenty
years. If this should be plainly established before you, the claimant must be
excluded without delay on the ground of long-time prescription.
Given on the Idesof June, during the Consulate of the Caesars.
TITLE LXXIV.
WHERE A MINOR, AFTER ATTAINING His MAJORITY, RATIFIES AN ALIENATION MADE
WITHOUT A DECREE.
1. The Emperor Gordian to Licinia.
You allege that your father's curator sold a rustic estate to the heir of the
creditor, or the former guardian of your father, without obtaining a Decree
from the Governor, and that your father, having been deceived, ratified the
sale. If it should be proved that the land was sold for too low a price, and
that your father, having been led into error, consented to the sale through
mistake, it is not unreasonable that what is lacking of the proper price should
be paid. This should be ordered by the Governor of the province, who must know
that if the other party did not act in good faith, he should be given the
choice of returning the land with the profits, or of making up the deficiency
by paying the money with the lawful interest.
Given on the Nonesof October, during the Consulate of Pius and Pontianus, 239.
2. The Same to Alexander.
If your lands have been alienated by your guardian without the authority of a
decree, and you have not expressly confirmed the sale, or if the possessor is
one in good faith, but has not had possession for a sufficient time to render
legal what in the first place was wrongfully
done, the Governor of the province shall order the property to be returned to
you.
Given on the seventh of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of Pius and
Pontianus, 239.
3. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Prsetorian Prefect.
Where the property of minors has been alienated or encumbered without a decree,
while they were still in charge of regularly appointed curators, or the said
minors, having attained their majority, have been released from their care
through the benefit of age, and, after a long silence, have filed a complaint
on this ground, so that the illegal alienation or encumbrance has been
confirmed by their protracted silence, We decree that a certain time shall be
fixed for the establishment of such a confirmation. Therefore We order that if
no complaint is made with reference to an alienation or encumbrance of this
kind, for the term of five continuous years after the minor has attained his
majority, that is to say, after he has reached the full age of twenty-five
years, by him who did this, or his heir, the act can, by no means, be revoked
under the pretext of the omission of judicial sanction, but shall stand, just
as if the property had been legally alienated or encumbered in the beginning by
virtue of a lawful decree.
Donations by minors cannot be confirmed by a decree, for even if, after they
are entitled to the benefit of age, they should transfer any immovable property
to another as a donation (except in the case of one made in consideration of
marriage), this cannot be confirmed, unless the donor should acquiesce, and ten
years have elapsed after the minor has reached the age of twenty-five years,
the parties being present; or twenty years after, if they are absent; so that,
in the case of an heir, the time only can be counted which passed in silence
after the latter attained his majority.
Given on the Idesof April, during the fifth Consulate of Decius, 529.
TITLE LXXV.
CONCERNING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS TO BE INSTITUTED AGAINST MAGISTRATES.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Mutianus.
If the magistrates by whom guardians or curators were appointed for you
compelled them to stipulate in their own names that they would make good any
losses, and if anything was paid they would receive it, and they took sureties
for this purpose, the actions which you have brought against your guardians or
curators will not annul the obligation against the magistrates for any amount
over and above that which is secured.
A praetorian action can be brought by you against the magistrates who appointed
the curators, if, after having exhausted all their property, and having
recovered what is proved to have been fraudulently
alienated, you have not been satisfied in full. If you bring such a suit, and
the magistrates assign to you their rights of action against the sureties whom
they have accepted, you can proceed against them, although you have a
prsetorian action without the assignment.
Given on the Nonesof January, during the Consulate of the two Aspers, 213.
2. The Emperor Alexander to Paternus.
An action is not usually granted against the heirs of a magistrate, when a
guardian has not been guilty of gross negligence in providing proper security
for his ward.
Given on the third of the Nonesof July, during the Consulate of Julian, Consul
for the second time, and Crispinus, 225.
3. The Emperor Gordian to Probianus.
If you and your colleague, while discharging the duties of the magistracy,
appointed a guardian who was insolvent, without requiring him to furnish proper
security, the ward cannot be indemnified except by calling both of you to
account, and you will not unjustly demand that a right of action be granted you
for your colleague's share of the liability.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of Pius and
Pontianus, 239.
4. The Same to Anuntianus.
Proceedings cannot be instituted against a person who has appointed an
insolvent guardian or curator before the property of the latter, as well as
that of his surety and his colleagues, has been exhausted, as you have assumed
the risk of the administration together, and the ward or minor has not been
fully indemnified.
Given during the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Atticus and
Prsetextatus, 243.
5. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Eugenia.
With reference to municipal magistrates who have appointed guardians, it is
established by a Decree of the Senate proposed by Our Divine Father, Trajan,
that if the said guardians, at the end of their administration, should prove to
be insolvent, and the entire amount cannot be collected from the surety; an
equitable action for the deficiency will lie in favor of the wards against the
magistrates.
Given on the seventh of the Idesof December, during the Consulate of the same
Emperors.
6. The Emperor Zeno to &lianus, Prsetorian Prefect.
When, as is customary, a decree of appointment was added to the decision of the
Pra?tor authorizing the general administration of a curator, it is clear that
the appointment is not valid; but it is the fault of the clerk who, in
appraising the property of the minor, did not assign to the estate a value of
more than two hundred pounds of gold, and accepted security for that amount.
In this instance, the account of the curator should not be called in question,
if any injury to the property of the minor is proved to have resulted contrary
to the provisions of the law, but legal proceedings should be instituted on the
ground of the negligence or fraud of the clerk, who suffered the true valuation
of the property of the minor
to be concealed. ..,, -> ,_Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof January,

THE CODE OF OUR LORD
THE MOST HOLY EMPEROR JUSTINIAN.
SECOND EDITION.
BOOK VI.

TITLE I.
CONCERNING FUGITIVE AND MUNICIPAL SLAVES, FREEDMEN, AND ARTISANS ASSIGNED TO
DIFFERENT WORKS WHO BELONG TO PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS OR TO THE STATE.

1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to JEmilia.
It is clear that a fugitive slave commits a theft of himself, and therefore
that he is not entitled to either usucaption or prescription based upon long
time, in order that the flight of slaves may not, for any reason whatsoever,
result in loss to their masters.
Given on the Idesof December, during the Consulate of Maximian, Consul for the
second time, and Aquilinus, 386.

2. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Pompeianus.
It is the duty of the Governor to grant authority to seek for
fugitive slaves.
Given on the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of the Csesars.

3. The Emperor Constantine to Probus.
If fugitive slaves are captured while on the way to the country of the
barbarians, they may either be punished by the amputation of a foot, or they
may be condemned to the mines, or any other penalty whatsoever may be imposed
upon them.
Without date or designation of consulate.
Extract from Novel 134, Last Chapter. Latin Text.If the nature of the crime
requires the loss of a member, under the new law one hand only shall be cut
off, and the slave convicted of
theft shall not be put to death, nor shall he lose another member, but he shall
be punished in some other way.
Persons are called thieves who commit this offence secretly and without arms;
those, however, who employ violence either with or without arms, by entering
houses, or by depredations on the highway or the sea, shall be subjected to the
penalty prescribed by law.

4. The Emperor Constantine to Valerian.
Whoever harbors a fugitive slave in his house, or on his land, without the
knowledge of his master, must surrender him, together with another of the same
value, or pay twenty solidi.If he should harbor the same slave for the second
or third time, he will be required, in addition to the said slave, to give up
two or three others to the master, or the aforesaid valuation of each one of
them.
Where minors are guilty of this offence, their guardians or curators are liable
for a similar sum. If the guilty party is not able to pay the penalty above-
mentioned, he shall be punished according to the discretion of a competent
judge.
If a slave falsely stated that he is freeborn, and was hired by anyone, the
person who employed him cannot be accused. It is necessary for the slave to be
tortured in order to determine whether or not he who received him fraudulently
induced him to leave his master, in order that his house or his land might be
profited. If it should be disclosed by the examination of the slave that the
act was malicious, he who was guilty of it shall be deprived of one of his own
slaves who will belong to the Treasury.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Gallicanus
and Bassus, 317.

5. The Same Emperors to Januarius.
It is established that slaves belonging to the public, who are skilled in
certain trades, must remain in their respective towns, and if anyone should
induce such a slave to betake himself elsewhere, he must surrender him whom he
has instigated to do so, together with another of the same value, and the sum
of twelve solidimust be paid by him to the Treasury of the town whose slave he
took away. Freedmen, also, who have trades, when induced to leave, shall be
returned in the same manner to the city.
If the fugitive slave is not sought for and returned by the efforts of the
defender of the city, the said defender shall be required to furnish two other
slaves in his stead, nor can he profit by the indulgence of the Emperor, and no
sale of the said slave made by him personally or through another will be valid.
Given on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of
Constantine, Consul for the fifth time, and the Caesar Lici-nius, 319.

6. The Same Emperor to Tiberianus, Count of the Spains.When anyone claims a
fugitive slave, and the person having possession of him alleges that he is the
owner, for the purpose of evading
the law which establishes a certain penalty for those who conceal fugitive
slaves, or he instigates the slave himself to say that he is free, the
worthless scoundrel whose status is in question shall immediately be subjected
to torture, in order that, the truth having been ascertained, an end may be put
to the dispute. This will not only be a benefit to both claimants, but it will
also deter slaves from taking to
flight.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of
Pacatianus and Hilarianus, 332.

7. The Emperors Valens, Valentinian, and Gratian to Felix, a Man of Consular
Rank.
Anyone who conceals a fiscal slave shall not only be compelled to restore him,
but also to pay twenty pounds of silver to Our Treasury, by way of penalty.
Given on the eleventh of the Idesof April, during the Consulate of Gratian,
Consul for the second time, and Probus, 371.

8. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Albinus, Prefect of
the City of Rome.
If a slave employed in a workship or in any other public establishment,
unmindful of his own condition, should marry a female slave in the house of
another, not only himself, but also his wife and children, shall forthwith be
returned to their former condition and labor.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Timasius
and Promotus, 389.

TITLE II.
CONCERNING THEFTS AND THE OFFENCE OF CORRUPTING
A SLAVE.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Theogenes.
If any persons have purchased land with your money, under the direction of your
slave, you must choose whether you will bring a personal action of theft or one
on mandate. For justice will not suffer you, at the same time, to bring a
criminal action, and require a bona fidecontract to be carried out.
2. The Same Emperors to Merchants.
You demand what is contrary to law when you ask that property which you state
has been stolen from you must be paid for by the owners before being returned
by you. Therefore, take care to be more cautious in your business transactions
hereafter, lest you may not only sustain losses of this kind, but also be
liable to suspicion of crime.
Given on the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of Chilo
and Libo, 205.
3. The Emperor Antoninus to Secundus.
If the property which your stepfather stole from you has not yet been dedicated
to the service of the divine temple, you will be entitled to an action of theft
against him.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof September, during the Consulate of Laetus,
Consul for the second time, and Cerealis, 216.
4. The Emperor Alexander to Aurelius Herod.
You can bring the suit for corrupting a slave only against him who you allege
induced your slave to leave you, if he rendered him more vicious than he
formerly was. You can also bring an action of theft against him, if he harbored
him after having caused him to take to flight. You are not, by any means,
forbidden to bring these actions by an attorney.
Given on the Idesof September, during the Consulate of Alexander, 223.
5. The Same to Cornelius.
What your adversary requires of you, namely, that you should produce the vendor
of the property which you acknowledge is in your possession, is in accordance
with law; for it is not proper to say that you purchased it from some passerby
who was unknown to you, if you wish to avoid suspicion, which should not attach
to an honest man.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and ^Elianus, 224.
6. The Same to Pythidorus.
Anyone who, knowingly, has sold a slave belonging to another, without the
consent of the owner, or has given him away, or has disposed of him in any
other manner, can in no respect affect the rights of the owner. If he conceals
him, or retains him in his possession, he is guilty of theft.
Given on the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Julian, Consul for the
second time, and Crispinus, 225.
7. The Same to Datus.
If he to whom you allege you entrusted money to be given to your mother only
paid over a portion of it, and converted the remainder to his own use, he
committed a theft.
Given on the Idesof June, during the Consulate of Modestus and Probus, 229.
8. The Same to Valentinus.
The collector of taxes is also liable to an action of theft if, after you have
paid the tax which you owed, he, aware that nothing is due from you, takes away
your female slave, or sells her. A transaction of this kind does not permit the
purchaser to obtain a title to the said
slave by usucaption, and an action for her recovery will lie in your
favor.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate
of Pompeianus and Pelignus, 232.
9. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Edisius.
Whether your slave has been taken from you by theft, or you have been deprived
of him by force, even though the said slave may be dead, the responsibility
will still attach to the robber or the thief, and either one of them will be
liable to the punishment prescribed by law.
Given on the seventh of the Kalendsof February ....
10. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Valerius.
If the Governor of the province should ascertain that the slave who was sold
was stolen or kidnapped, as the purchaser cannot acquire him by usucaption, on
account of the defect in the title, before possession of the slave is returned
to his master, Ije must take measures for him to be restored to you, if he
should find that you have succeeded to the person to whom he previously
belonged.
Without date or designation of consulate.
11. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Demosthenes.
Have recourse to the Governor of the province with reference to the property
which you allege in your petition that the stepmother of your ward
appropriated, and if he should ascertain that she took it after he in whose
behalf you apply has become the owner of the said property, he will not be
ignorant that she is liable to the payment of quadruple damages for manifest
theft; and if this should not be the case, she should be condemned to pay
double damages for non-manifest theft.
Given on the seventh of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of the
Cassars.
12. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Quinta.
The children of a female slave, who were born while she was in possession of a
thief, cannot be acquired by usucaption, before they have gone into possession
of their owner, and it is established that he who stole the mother will be
liable to an action of theft on their account. Therefore, you will not be
prevented from making use of an action of theft, as well as a personal action,
or one against the possessor for the recovery of the slaves, as the one which
includes the penalty can, by no means, deprive you of the employment of the
other. For there is no question that in law the action for recovery can be
brought at the same time as the criminal action, as even those who have
purchased slaves belonging to others, where they were aware of the fact, will
be liable to an action of theft.
Given on the Idesof October, during the Consulate of the Csesars.
13. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Domnus.The laws forbid suit to be brought
after a theft has been compromised. If, however, you did not compromise, but
only a portion
of the property stolen from you was returned, you can bring suit to recover the
remainder, or a personal action, or an action of theft, before the Governor of
the province.
Given on the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the Caesars.
14. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Dionysius.
You can bring suit against those who have knowingly received property stolen by
a slave, not only as receivers of stolen goods, but you can also bring a penal
action of theft against them.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
15. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Socrata.
You should not be ignorant that heirs are not under any circumstances liable to
the action of theft,1 but you can bring an action in remagainst them, with
reference to documents which have been stolen and retained.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
16. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Artemidorus and Others.
If he who received your slave for the purpose of furnishing him with provisions
should sell him, he commits a theft.
Given on the Kalendsof October, under the Consulate of the Csesars.
17. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Colon.
Although ordinary custom does not permit a wife who has been guilty of the
crime of plundering an estate to be liable to the action of theft, still, the
heirs, who were also the children of the deceased, will be prevented from
bringing an action in remagainst her, on account of the property belonging to
their father's estate, which she has in her possession.
Given on the Idesof December, during the Consulate of the Csesars.
18. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Dionysiodorus. "The terms of the Perpetual
Edict set forth that he who has obtained property by shipwreck or fire, or is
said to have caused any loss under such circumstances, is liable for quadruple
damages, if the action is brought within the available year, but only for
simple damages in addition to the penalty already prescribed by law if it is
brought after the expiration of a year.
Given at Nicomedia, on the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.

NEW CONSTITUTION OF THE EMPEROR FREDERICK HAVING REFERENCE TO THE ABOLITION OF
LAWS AND CUSTOMS PROMULGATED AGAINST THE FREEDOM OF THE CHURCH,
COLL. 10.
No matter where ships may approach the land, when they are wrecked by accident
or run aground, the vessels themselves, as well as the goods which they
contain, shall be preserved for those to whom they belonged before the ships
met with this accident; and every custom in violation of this law, no matter in
what place it may be observed, is hereby abolished, unless the ships are
employed in piracy, or are hostile to Us, or to the Christian name.
Those who violate this Our constitution shall be punished by confiscation of
their property, and, if the circumstances demand it, their audacity in
disobeying Our mandate shall be repressed by other measures.
19. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Nestiseus.
When a false agent receives a deposit or collects a debt without the consent of
the owner, he is guilty of theft, and is liable to be sued for double damages,
as well as to an action for non-manifest theft, in addition to being compelled
to return the property.
Without date or designation of consulate.
20. The Emperor Justinian to Julian, Prsetorian Prefect.
If anyone should induce a slave belonging to another to steal the property of
his master, and bring it to him, and the slave reveals this to his master, and
the latter permits him to take the property to the guilty person who has
instigated him to steal it, and the former should be found in possession of the
said property, the ancient authorities were in doubt as to what action he who
had received it was liable, whether to that of theft, or to the one for having
corrupted a slave, because he attempted to corrupt him, or whether he is liable
to both. Therefore, for the purpose of settling controversies of this kind, We
have decided that not only the action of theft can be granted against him, but
also the one for having corrupted a slave; for although the slave was not made
any worse on this account, still, the advice of the person attempting to
corrupt him was given with the intention of impairing his honesty. And just as
according to the rule of law, while a theft may not actually be committed, the
culprit who handles property against the will of the owner is considered to
have stolen it, and should be liable to the action of theft on account of his
fraudulent act; so, it is not unreasonable that the action for the corruption
of a slave will lie against him on account of his criminality, in order that he
may be sued in a penal action, just as if he had actually corrupted the slave,
lest, encouraged by impunity, he might attempt to pursue the same course with
another slave who could easily be corrupted.
Given on the Kalendsof August, during the fifth Consulate of Lampadius and
Orestes, 530.
21. The Same to Julian, Prsetorian Prefect.
'The question arose among the ancient authorities, if a slave, whom someone
possessed in good faith, should commit theft of the property of others, or of
him who had possession of him, whether the latter would be entitled to a noxal
action for theft against his true owner, or whether the above-mentioned action
could be brought against him by the person against whom the theft was
committed. Some authorities, on the assumption that a general rule can be
formulated from the ancient laws in favor of a man of this kind, by which he
against whom the action of theft is not granted could have a noxal action
brought against him, held that this rule was based upon mere conjecture, and
that the action of theft could, under no circumstances, include the bona,
fidepossessor of the slave; and that the noxal action of theft could lawfully
be granted to him, if the property was stolen from him, against the true owner
of the slave. Hence the bona fidepossessor of the slave could, on account of
the theft which he had sustained, have a noxal right of action against the
owner; even though the slave was proved not to have been in the possession of
the latter. He would also be entitled to an action against the true owner, not
only for the property which the slave took away while under his control, but
also for that which he stole from his bona fidepossessor, even if it should be
proved that he was not yet under the control of his true owner. This is the
interpretation which the authorities conjectured was to be given to the ancient
laws.
We, however, examining this point thoroughly, and more in conformity with the
truth, have adopted the rule promulgated in the beginning. Therefore, as a bona
fidepossessor is in possession of the thief as his master, it is reasonable
that while he is under his control he should be liable in a noxal action to
others, if they had property stolen by the slave, and that he himself should
have no right of action against the true owner of the slave, in accordance with
the rule that he who is entitled to the action of theft against another cannot
himself be liable to one based on the same offence.
Where, however, the bona fidepossessor has lost control of the said slave, and
he is found in the hands of his true owner, then he himself will, by no means,
be liable to the noxal action of theft, but he will have the right to bring a
noxal action of theft against the true owner for property which the slave stole
when under his control, as well as for any thefts of which he was previously
guilty after having been released from the control of his bona fidepossessor,
and before he came into the possession of his true owner.
Thus, a second time, the case stated conforms to the general rule, for he who
has a right of action of theft against the owner cannot himself be held liable
to others in the action of theft; and hence the doubt formerly entertained by
the ancient jurists, and disclosed by their contrary opinions is disposed of by
Our interposition, and a bona fidepossessor is entitled to an action during the
prescribed term, and is not responsible; while the owner himself at one time is
not liable to the action, and at another it can be brought against him.
Moreover, where a man who, while actually free, is, nevertheless, held by
another in good faith as a slave, commits a theft, and it should be legally and
undoubtedly ascertained that he is free, he can be sued for the theft by him
who had possession of him in good faith; and the latter, if the said freeman
should steal from a stranger, cannot be sued, but the former must be liable for
his own theft, as the general rule promulgated with reference to a slave and
for the benefit of one who is not a slave but a freeman, and his own master, is
that a noxal action cannot be brought against the latter, and is unknown to our
laws.
Given on the Kalendsof October, during the fifth Consulate of Lampadius and
Orestes, 530.
22. The Same to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
It is a clear rule of law that, where a theft has taken place, an action will
lie in favor of him who is interested in not having had it committed. Where,
however, anyone lent another property belonging to himself, and it was stolen,
the question arose among the ancient legal authorities whether an action of
theft could be brought by the person who received it for his use, against the
thief, of course where the latter was solvent; for the reason that the borrower
himself was liable to an action of loan by the owner of the stolen property. It
was, however, hardly conceded that he himself would have a right of action,
unless he was known to be in poverty, for then the authorities held that the
action of theft would lie in favor of the owner. For here the doubt increased,
if at the time when the theft was perpetrated, the person who borrowed the
property was solvent, but afterwards was reduced to indigence before the suit
was brought to which he was previously entitled, whether the right of action
which he had once acquired should still remain in him, or revert to the owner
of the property; and then the question arose whether, in a case of this kind,
the right of action was alterable, or not.
Another subdivision remains to be made with reference to this discussion,
namely, where the person who received the property for use was partly solvent
so that he could not make payment of all that was due, but only of a portion of
the same, whether or not he would be entitled to the action of theft.
(1) Hence, We have resolved the doubts of the ancients so far as these matters
are concerned; nay, it is better to say that We have finally disposed of these
perplexing distinctions by an opinion which is more simple than the
difficulties were great, and We hold that the owner shall be authorized to
choose whether he shall proceed by an action of loan against the person who
received the property, or bring an action of theft against the one who stole
it; and having selected one of these methods of procedure, the owner cannot
change his mind, and have recourse to the other, and if he decides to sue the
thief, he who received the property for use shall be absolutely released from
liability.
Where, however, as the lender, he proceeds against him who borrowed the
property, he can, under no circumstances, bring the action of theft against the
thief, and he who is sued on account of the property which was loaned will
himself be entitled to the action of theft against the thief; provided that the
owner, being aware that the property has been stolen, proceeds against him to
whom it was lent.
(2) When, however, he brings suit, not knowing that the property was in
possession of the person to whom it had been lent, or, being in doubt whether
this was the case, and, after the property has been found, he wishes to abandon
the action of loan, and have recourse to that of theft, permission shall be
granted him to do so, and to proceed against the thief, and he cannot
successfully be opposed, as he was uncertain who had the property when he
brought the action of loan against him who received it for use, unless the
owner of the same has been indemnified by him. For in this case, the thief will
be absolutely released from liability to the action of theft by the owner, but
he will be substituted for the person who made good to the owner the property
lent to him, as it is perfectly evident that if, in the beginning, the owner
brought the action of loan, being ignorant at the time that the property had
been stolen, and after he ascertained this and proceeded against the thief, he
who borrowed the property will be absolutely released, no matter what the
result of the action brought against the thief by the owner of the property may
be.
The same rule will apply where he who borrowed the article for use is partly,
or entirely, solvent.
(3) A second doubt arose among the ancient authorities, that is to say, what
should be decided where someone borrowed property for use, and another stole it
from him, and the latter, having been sued, had judgment rendered against him,
not only for what was stolen, but also for the penalty of theft, and the owner
afterwards came in and desired to collect the entire amount of the judgment, as
being rendered for property belonging to him ?
In cases of this kind the ancient jurists were also in doubt whether only his
property, or the value of the same, should be delivered to the owner, or
whether the sum exacted as a penalty should also be paid to him. And although
various opinions were held by them on this point, and Papinianus himself made
different statements regarding it, We have decided that notwithstanding the
conflicting opinions of Papinianus, not his first, but his second conclusion,
should be adopted, in which he held that the profit ought, by no means, to come
into the hands of the owner of the property. For he who has borne the risk
should also obtain the advantage; so that he who received the property as a
loan will not suffer any loss, but will be permitted to enjoy the benefit
resulting from his efforts.
(4) In the resolution of the doubts above set forth, a third question arose,
and why should We not decide it, also? For, as it is a perfectly plain rule of
law that a husband cannot, during the existence of the marriage, bring the
action of theft against his wife, for the reason that the law is ashamed to
grant such an atrocious proceeding
against a person so intimately connected with him, the point raised by the
ancient jurists was as follows: where property which was lent to a man for use
was stolen from him by his wife, the question arose whether the owner would
have the right to bring suit for theft against the woman, or whether, on
account of the necessity of the case, her husband, being liable to the action
of loan, would have a right to bring the action of theft against her? Many
arguments on this point were advanced by the authorities.
It can, however, clearly be settled by the present law, and by Our former
decisions which are included in this constitution.
For if We grant the choice to the owner to proceed against either of the
parties whom he may select, that is, either against the one who borrowed the
property, or against him who committed the theft, in this instance, the
husband, on account of the respect attaching to marriage, shall have a right to
bring, not an action of theft, but one for the surreptitious removal of
property, if the owner should choose to proceed against him.
The owner has perfect liberty to bring an action of loan against the husband,
or an action of theft against the wife, with the understanding that where he
who borrowed the article is solvent, the action of theft cannot be brought
against the wife, lest where husband and wife do not live in harmony, this may
be made the occasion of some artifice, and the wife may, with the consent of
the husband, be given up by him, and suffer the penal condemnation for theft.

of Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
TITLE III. CONCERNING THE SERVICES OP FREEDMEN.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Romanus.
If, at the time of your manumission, services were imposed upon you as a
condition of the same, you are advised that you must render them. It is,
however, usually agreed between patrons and freedmen that something in the way
of service shall be given for the latter, although a price cannot be demanded
for what is done, unless when, on account of poverty, necessity may require
this to be paid for support, which is unusual; and even though no services have
been imposed upon you, still, if your patron should lose his property, you will
be obliged to support him.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate
of Chilo and Libo, 205.
2. The Same Emperors to Eutyches.
A slave who has been manumitted cannot again be reduced to servitude by the
person who liberated him, nor can he be compelled to perform services
subsequently imposed upon him.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof May, during the second Consulate of
Antoninus and Geta, 206.
3. The Same Emperors to Quintiniamis.
He who has received money from a stranger with the understanding that he shall
manumit his slave, and also exacts money from the slave on account of work
performed, whether services were imposed upon him or not, shall be forced to
return the money paid as constituting a debt which is not due.
Given on the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of Albinus and
.^Emilianus, 207.
4. The Emperor Antoninus to Valerian.
If you prove that you are entitled to money derived from the sale of the
services of your freedman, the Governor will order it to be paid to you by him.
The freedman has perfect liberty to execute a will, provided that the agreement
which he made was not entered into for the purpose of oppressing liberty.
Given on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of the two
Aspers, 213.
5. The Same Emperors to Terentius.
Your mother cannot claim services imposed upon one whom she manumitted, in
accordance with the terms of a trust, unless the time when she manumitted him
preceded that fixed by the trust. If, however, he should not show her the
respect due to a patroness, she can apply to a competent judge to claim what
she is entitled to.
Given on the third of the Idesof May, during the Consulate of the two Aspers,
213.
6. The Emperor Alexander to Cecilius.
The freedmen and freedwomen of deceased persons do not owe services to the
foreign heirs of their patrons, or to the husbands of their patronesses.
Given on the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of Alexander, 225.
7. The Same to Minicius.
It is not lawful for patrons to receive money for the services of their
freedmen, although if the services are not performed, a want of proper respect
cannot furnish a good ground for its collection. He who has had two sons under
his control at the same, or different times, is, by the Lex Juliarelating to
Marriages, released from the obligation of rendering services.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of Julian,
Consul for the second time, and Crispinus, 276.
8. The Same Emperor to Augustinus.
If you have been purchased with your own money from him who manumitted you, you
do not owe him any services, nor can you be punished by him for ingratitude.
You will not, however, be allowed to deny that he is your patron.
Given on the third of the Idesof September, during the Consulate of Julian,
Consul for the second time, and Crispinus, 226.
9. The Same to Lictorius.
You have exalted the rank of your freedwoman by having married her, and
therefore she should not be compelled to perform services for you, as you
should be satisfied with the benefit of the law which provides that she cannot
legally marry another without your consent.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Fuscus and
Dexter, 226.
10. The Same Emperor to Herculianus.
Titius executed a will conferring freedom upon his slave Gaius, under the
following condition: "I desire that my slave, Gaius, shall be manumitted when
three years have elapsed from the time of my death, provided he performs for my
heirs the same services which he was accustomed to perform for me in my
lifetime."
As the said slave always rendered the same services to the testator every day,
and after his death continued to render them to his heirs until the time when
he obtained his freedom, it is clear that, having become free, he cannot be
compelled to perform the same services
afterwards.
Given on the seventh of the Idesof August, during the Consulate
of Fuscus and Dexter, 226.
11. The Emperor Gordian to Africanus.
A child born of a freedwoman is freeborn. Where a man has given his consent in
the marriage of his freedwoman, although he cannot exact services from her,
still he does not lose his rights as a patron.
Given on the third of the Nonesof August, during the Consulate of Pius and
Pontianus, 239.
12. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Veneria.
Persons who have been manumitted are at perfect liberty to reside wherever they
choose, nor can they again be reduced to slavery by the children of their
patrons, to whom they only owe respect, unless they are proved to be
ungrateful; nor do the laws compel freedmen to live
with their patrons.
Given on the ninth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of
the same Emperors.
13. The Emperors Valens, Valentinian and Gratian to Probus, Prsetorian Prefect.
Punishment shall be inflicted upon anyone who harbors the freedman of another
who owes services to his patron.
Given on the third of the Idesof July, during the Consulate of Gratian, Consul
for the second time, and Probus, 371.
TITLE IV.
CONCERNING THE PROPERTY OF FREEDMEN AND THE RIGHTS OP PATRONAGE.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Secunda.
It makes a great deal of difference whether a slave obtains his freedom by
means of his own money, and is manumitted by his purchaser, or whether he is
entitled to his liberty by reason of a sum paid by his master; for, in the
first instance, it is established that the patron cannot be admitted to the
possession of the estate contrary to the will of his freedman; but in the
second instance, he retains all the rights of patronage. Therefore, when the
property of Sabinianus, the son of a patron, who, during his lifetime, was
entitled to all the rights of patronage, was claimed by the Treasury on account
of his being a public enemy, according to the regulations established by the
Divine Pertinax, and adopted by Us, Our Treasury will succeed to the rights
imposed upon his freedmen.
Given on the fifth of the Nonesof July, during the Consulate of Faustinus and
Rufinus, 211.
2. The Emperors Valens and Valentinian to Florian, Count of Private Affairs.
If freedmen, with the consent of their patrons, choose to marry Our female
slaves or serfs, their patrons are hereby informed that they will hereafter
forfeit the benefits of patronage.
Given on the third of the Idesof October, during the fifth Consulate of
Lupicinius and Jovinus, 367.
3. The Emperor Justinian to Demosthenes, Pr&torian Prefect.When a patron
hereafter expects his freedman to be released from the rights of patronage,
either by the execution of instruments between the parties while living, or by
a will or codicil, or by means of verbal statements, the ancient interpretation
of the law having been abolished, no doubt can exist that the freedman will be
released from the right of patronage solely by the expression of words of this
kind; nor are those rights reserved by Us for patrons, unimpaired, where
successions descend ab intestato;and which the ancients decided should be
preserved with reference to the property of freedmen, even -after the execution
of such instruments.
As everyone is aware that, just as in the case of the restitution of birth, all
rights of patronage are abolished, so under these circumstances the same effect
should be observed. This rule of law applies where manumission takes place
inter vivos,and the release of the right of patronage has been granted by last
wills; so that restitutions of birth, in all instances in which freedmen are
only entitled to their liberty, may obtain as much force as possible in Our
Empire, as We prefer that it be inhabited rather by freeborn persons than by
those who have been emancipated from slavery.
The respect, however, which is due from freedmen to patrons, and the rights
which can be exerted by them against ungrateful freedmen, shall remain
unimpaired; and if the right of patronage should be lost through the effect of
words, in accordance with the rule established by Us, the restitution of birth
alone will not entirely dispense with this right due to individuals who are
freeborn.
Moreover, in those instances in which unworthy persons have been deprived of
the rights of patronage by means of penal actions, the latter shall continue to
have full effect.
Read seven times in the New Consistory on the Palace of Justinian.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof November, during the fifth Consulate of
Decius, 529.
TITLE V.
WHERE AN ALIENATION HAS BEEN MADE BY FREEDMEN IN ORDER TO DEFRAUD THEIR PATRON.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csssars, to
Claudius.
If a freedman should alienate any property for the purpose of defrauding his
patron, it is established that power should be granted to revoke the alienation
for the amount of the lawful share to which
the patron is entitled.
Given on the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
2. The Same Emperors and Csssars to Julia.
When a patron succeeds to the inheritance of a freedman, who dies intestate, he
can, by means of the Calvisian Action, revoke any alienation fraudulently made.
But, as you assert that the patron has confirmed the donation of the land after
the death of his freedman, the heirs of the patron cannot, in any way,
invalidate the act of the person granting the manumission.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
TITLE VI. CONCERNING THE DEFERENCE TO BE SHOWN TO A PATRON.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Zoticus.
You cannot bring an action involving infamy against your patron. Given on the
second of the Idesof May, during the Consulate of Maximus, Consul for the
second time, and JElianus, 224.
2. The Same to Leontogonus.
Freedwomen who have been lawfully married with the consent of their patron
cannot be compelled to render him services.
Given on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of
Maximus, Consul for the second time, and JElianus, 224.
3. The Same to Xanthus.
Slaves who are manumitted by their masters in compliance with an agreement owe
them all the respect ordinarily required by law.
4. The Same to Victorinus.
If you have offered violence, and shown insolence towards him who manumitted
you, that is to say, him who, by generously releasing you from servitude,
enabled you to become his adversary, the Governor of the province shall decide
how he shall punish such audacity, for if money was due to you from your
patron, or if any controversy existed between you on the subject of property,
you should not immediately have recourse to litigation. If, however, you should
venture to do a thing of this kind, you can readily convince the judge of the
justice of your claim without the use of injurious expressions, and still
preserve all the deference due to your patron.
Given on the second of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of Julian,
Consul for the second time, and Crispinus, 225.
5. The Emperor Gordian to Sulpitia.
There is no doubt that freedmen should show the children of their patron
ordinary respect, even though the latter may have been convicted of crime.
Hence, if they do not recognize their duty to manifest towards them the
reverence to which they are entitled, they will not unreasonably appear to have
given provocation for being' treated with severity.
Given on the Nonesof September, during the Consulate of Sabinus, Consul for the
second time, and Venustus, 341.
6. The Same to Cornelius.
There is no doubt that freedmen or freedwomen, especially those upon whom no
services have been imposed, are required to evince ordinary respect for those
who have manumitted them, rather than to perform servile labors for their
benefit, and that they cannot be placed in chains.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Atticus and
Pratextatus, 243.
7. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Metrodorus.
Authority ought not to be granted to freedmen to injure in any way the
stepchildren of their patronesses. It is intolerable that the freedmen of your
stepfather should be permitted to injure you, as you allege, and hence the
Governor of the province will have no hesitation in punishing those who are
guilty, in accordance with their condition.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof May, during the Consulate of Maximus, Consul
for the second time, and Aquilinus, 286.
8. The Same Emperors to Hermia.
It is not right for you to refuse to your patroness the respect to which she is
entitled.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of
Diocletian and Maximian, 287.
TITLE VII. CONCERNING FREEDMEN AND THEIR CHILDREN.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Daphnus.
It is well known that a woman who has manumitted a slave under the terms of a
trust cannot afterwards accuse him of being guilty of ingratitude, for this
power is only granted to one who gratuitously bestows freedom upon a slave, and
not to one who gives it when it is
due.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of
Messala and Sabinus, 215.
2. The Emperor Constantius to Maximus, Prefect of the City.
If a slave, who has been manumitted, has manifested ingratitude to his patron,
and has behaved towards him with insolence or obstinacy, or has been guilty of
some slight offence against him, he shall again be placed under the control and
authority of his master, if the latter can prove that he was ungrateful in a
complaint brought before an ordinary judge, or judges specially appointed. Any
children that may have been subsequently born to him shall also be reduced to
slavery, as the crimes of their parents do not affect those who were proved to
have been born at the time that the former obtained their
freedom.
Anyone, however, who has been formally liberated in Our Council, and, after
punishment, shows by his repentance that he is worthy of again being invested
with Roman citizenship, shall not enjoy the benefit of freedom, unless his
patron obtains this favor for him in consequence of his entreaties.
Given at Rome, on the Idesof April, during the Consulate of Constantius, Consul
for the fifth time, and the Caesar Constans, 319. 8. The Emperors Honorius and
Theodosius to the Senate.Freedmen shall not only not be heard against their
patrons, but they must also manifest the same respect for their heirs that they
do for the patrons themselves, for they will have a right to proceed against
them for ingratitude, just as those who manumitted them can do, if, unmindful
of the freedom which was bestowed upon them, they are guilty of servile
wickedness.
Given at Ravenna, on the seventh of the Idesof August, during the Consulate of
Marinianus and Asclepiodotus.
4. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Bassus, Prsetorian Prefect.
When persons of the condition of freedmen, or their children, are shown to have
been ungrateful, they can undoubtedly again be reduced
to slavery.
Given at Ravenna, on the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Theodosius,
Consul for the eleventh time, and Valentine, 425.
TITLE Vill.
CONCERNING THE RIGHT TO WEAR GOLD RINGS, AND THE RESTITUTION OF BIRTH.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Philadelphus.
The Order of Decurions cannot restore birth and grant the right to be freeborn,
but this can be requested of Us.
Given at Ravenna, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate
of the above-named Emperors.
2. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Eumenes.
The use of gold rings, granted by the indulgence of the Emperor to freedmen,
gives them the appearance of being freeborn, but does not confer the condition
itself. Where freedmen are restored to the rights of former birth, they become
freeborn by virtue of Our favor.
Granted on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof . . . , under the Consulate of the
Caesars.
Extract from Novel 78, Chapters I, and II. Latin Text.
At present, however, those who manumit their slaves declare them to be Roman
citizens (for this cannot be done otherwise) and by virtue of this manumission
they have the right to wear gold rings, and be regenerated; but although they
are considered freemen and freeborn, the rights of patronage still remain
unimpaired.1
TITLE IX.
WHO CAN BE ADMITTED TO THE PR^STORIAN POSSESSION
OP PROPERTY AND WITHIN WHAT TIME THIS SHOULD
TAKE PLACE.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Macrina.
The praetorian possession of an estate granted to a son under paternal control
can be demanded even when his father is ignorant of the fact, and it also
benefits the latter if he ratifies the demand; but it is lost, if the time
prescribed by law has elapsed.
Without date or designation of consulate.
2. The Same to Crispinus.
If you alone have a right to the possession of an estate on account of your
near relationship to the deceased, you will be entitled to the
1 It was the theory of the Romans that all persons were born free and equal, a
principle, however, which was very far from being adopted in practice. On this
assumption was founded the natalibus suis restitutio,or the fictitious
restitution to his natal rights, by which a slave, when manumitted under
certain circumstances, was considered to have been freeborn. The patron's
consent was ordinarily deemed necessary for the bestowal of their mark of
imperial favor, and the full enjoyment of the privileges of a Roman citizen was
materially restricted by the fact that the patronal rights of his former master
were left intact, as shown by the text, an inconsistency which discloses how
loth the Roman patrician was to relinquish any of his authority over his former
dependents.ED.
term of a hundred available days from the time when you knew that your relative
was dead, for the purpose of obtaining possession of it. Given on the third of
the Nonesof November, during the Consulate of Geta.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Crescentius.
There is no doubt that the possession of an estate which has been accepted in
the name of an infant will legally descend to his heirs, even though he died
before being able to speak.
Given on the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of Maximus, Consul for the
second time, and Aquilinus, 286.
4. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Marcellus.
If an emancipated girl did not accept the possession of an estate within a
year, under the privilege granted to children in such cases, she cannot
transmit the claim to the succession to her heirs.
Given at Heraclea on the third of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of
the Csesars.
5. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Maximus.
You are unduly apprehensive if you think that the time fixed for the acceptance
of the possession of the estate will elapse, while the question remains
uncertain whether you are entitled to it by the terms of the will, as the heir
at law, or under what other title possession should be granted you.
6. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Frontina.
It is clear that ignorance of the law will be of no advantage to women in
accepting praetorian possession of property, so far as the time prescribed by
the Perpetual Edict is concerned.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of the Caesars.
7. Part of a Letter of the Emperors Constantius and Maximian, and the Csesars
Severus and Maximian.
It is plainly stated that a guardian can accept praetorian possession in the
name of his ward. The ward, however, cannot do so without the authority of his
guardian, unless, not having reached the age of puberty, he petitions for it,
and a competent judge, being aware of the fact, should grant him possession of
the estate; for, under such circumstances, the benefit of the succession is
considered to have been obtained by him under praetorian law.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof September, during the Consulate of Constantius
and Maximian, 306.
8. The Emperor Constantine to Dionysius.
Anyone who thinks that he is entitled to property belonging to the estate of
his parents or other relatives is hereby notified that he will not be prevented
from acquiring it, if, through rusticity, or ignorance of
the facts, or absence, or any other good reason, he is known to have failed to
have demanded praetorian possession within the time prescribed by law, as this
provision relaxes the strictness of the former practice.
Given at Heliopolis, on the day before the Idesof March, during the Consulate
of Constantine and the Caesar Constans.
9. The Same Emperors to the People.
As we have already excluded the subtleties of empty verbiage, We decree that
the following rule shall be observed, namely, that when any statement is made
in a will with reference to the acceptance of an estate, before any judge, or
even before duumvirs, it shall be done within the time fixed by former laws,
and if relatives in a more distant degree than those entitled to it have
acquired possession, it shall, nevertheless, have the same validity after the
time has elapsed as if the ordinary course had been pursued.
Given at Laodicea on the Kalendsof February.
TITLE X.
WHEN THE SHARES OF AN ESTATE TO WHICH THOSE WHO Do NOT DEMAND THEM ARE ENTITLED
ACCRUE TO
OTHERS, WHO ASK POSSESSION OF THE SAME. 1. The Emperor Gordian to Marthana.
Whenever lawful succession does not take place, and the possession of the
estate is granted to several children, some of whom neglect to take advantage
of the benefit granted by the Perpetual Edict, there is no doubt that those
alone who acquire possession of the estate will have their shares of the same
increased by the addition of those of the others who did not formulate a demand
for them.
TITLE XL
CONCERNING THE PRAETORIAN POSSESSION OF PROPERTY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
PROVISIONS OF THE WILL.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Vitalis.
While an appeal from the decision by which a will is declared to be forged is
pending, and it is still uncertain whether the deceased died intestate or not,
there is no ground to grant praetorian possession of the estate on account of
proximity of relationship.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and ^lianus, 224.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Corneliiis.
There is no doubt that, in accordance with the Edict of the Praetor, possession
of an estate cannot be demanded in accordance with the
provisions of the will, unless it bears the seals of seven witnesses. If,
however, it can be shown that this same number of witnesses were present when
an unwritten will was made, it is a well-established rule of law that a will of
this kind has been legally executed, and in accordance with it possession of
the estate should be granted.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Atticus
and Praetextatus, 243.
TITLE XII.
CONCERNING THE POSSESSION OF AN ESTATE IN OPPOSITION TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE
WILL WHICH THE
PR^TOR PROMISES TO CHILDREN.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Rufus.
Where the possession of an estate contrary to the provisions of a will has been
granted to descendants, they should, in accordance with the Edict, only pay the
legacies bequeathed by the testator to his ascendants and to his children.
Given on the fourth of the Idesof October, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and .^Elianus, 224.
2. The Same to Clara.
When a posthumous child is born, who was neither appointed an heir by his
father nor disinherited by name, the will is broken; and if praetorian
possession of the estate contrary to the provisions of will is demanded by its
guardian in the name of the infant, possession in accordance with its
provisions cannot take place.
Given on the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Julian, Consul for the
second time, and Crispinus, 225.
TITLE XIII.
CONCERNING PRAETORIAN POSSESSION OF THE ESTATE OF
A FREEDMAN CONTRARY TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE WILL
GRANTED TO His PATRONS OR THEIR CHILDREN.
1. The Emperor Gordian to Herculianus.
Although you allege that he who was manumitted by you and your sister was
liberated in accordance with the terms of the trust contained in your father's
will, still, if he appointed foreign heirs, you can obtain possession of your
lawful share of the estate contrary to the provisions of the will, if you make
the demand; or you can do so in opposition to an unwritten will, if one of this
kind was executed, provided you file your claim for the said lawful share of
the estate within the time prescribed by the Edict.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of Gordian
and Aviola, 240.
2. The Emperor Anastasius to Asclepiodotus.
The patron of a freedman upon whom certain duties and services have been
imposed is excluded from prastorian possession of his estate contrary to the
provisions of the will.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Viator
and ^Emilianus.
TITLE XIV. CONCERNING THE PROCEEDING UNDE LIBERI.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Sarpedo.
If your grandfather should die, leaving three emancipated sons, and they
acquire possession of his estate unde liberi,it is clear that they will be his
heirs pro rota.
Given on the fourth of the Nonesof . . . , during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and Aquilinus, 286.
2. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Zosimus.
Where a son or a grandson, who is a proper heir, is called to the succession ab
intestato,no one else can be the heir at law.
Given on the third of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of the same
Emperors and Csesars.
3. The Emperor Constantine to Leontius, Count of Private Affairs in the East.
He who rejects the estate of his father will not be entitled to that of his
deceased paternal grandfather, to whom his father succeeded as heir at law,
above all if he has been emancipated, unless he obtains this advantage by means
of praetorian possession of their estates.
Given on the eighth of the Idesof April, during the Consulate of Liminius and
Catulinus, 349.
TITLE XV.
CONCERNING THE PROCEEDINGS UNDE LEGITIMI AND UNDE COGNATI.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Ulpia.
You cannot be prevented from claiming the estates of your cousins who died
intestate, if they did not belong by law to a nearer relative, and you accepted
possession of the same.
Given on the third of the Idesof August, during the Consulate of Julian, Consul
for the second time, and Crispinus, 225.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Zeno.As you allege that your second
cousin, that is to say, the son of your female cousin, died intestate, you
understand that you cannot
claim his succession without demanding praetorian possession of his
estate.
Given at Laodicea, on the seventh of the Kalendsof June, during
the Consulate of the above-named Emperors.
3. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Felix.
Succession is also granted by praetorian law in equal shares to grandsons of a
maternal grandmother.
Given on the Idesof October, during the Consulate of the Caesars.
4. The Same Emperors to Syrista.
It should not be asked whether anyone who retains possession of an estate does
or does not do so with the intention of acquiring it for himself, or whether he
has lost his hereditary right to the estate, or to praetorian possession of the
same.
Given on the eleventh of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
5. The Same Emperors to Plato.
It is certain that no cognate can legally succeed to an estate, except by means
of praetorian possession, but if the cognates of the deceased should be
unwilling to succeed him, they cannot be compelled to demand praetorian
possession of his estate.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of the
Caasars.
TITLE XVI. CONCERNING THE EDICT REGULATING THE SUCCESSION.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Julian.
If your mother did not accept possession of the estate of her uncle, on account
of her being insane, you, her son, will be admitted to prse-torian possession
of the said estate of your great-uncle, in accordance with the terms of the
Edict, by which, if the nearest relatives do not demand it, it will be granted
to those next in succession.
Given on the third of the Idesof December, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and ^Elianus, 224.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Firmus.
If the brother of the grandmother of those whose succession is in question
entered upon the estate under the will, and, as you assert they died intestate,
and the will was forged, and the person above mentioned also died intestate
without having demanded praetorian possession, and you, although in the fifth
degree, demanded praetorian possession of his estate on the ground of being his
successor, before the prescribed time had elapsed, you can legally claim their
estate. But if there is no doubt that if he who is in the fourth degree of
relationship made the demand in conformity with the Edict, and did not conceal
it from you, you will petition Us in vain.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof April, during the Consulate of the Caesars.
TITLE XVII. CONCERNING THE CARBONIAN EDICT.
1. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Flora.
If a question relative to your status and that of your son is raised by the
person against whom you petition, you will perceive that the demand for the
delivery of the property which your son claims as belonging to the estate of
his father has been made prematurely; for if your son still remain under the
age of puberty, praetorian possession of the estate should be given him in
accordance with the terms of the Carbonian Edict, and security should be
furnished by him, until it is proper for him to be placed in possession.
If, however, security is not furnished, possession should be given to all the
claimants, and the question of the servitude postponed until your son has
arrived at puberty.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
2. The Emperors Theodosius, Arcadius, and Honorius to Rufinus, Prsetorian
Prefect.
The Carbonian Edict has reference to persons born in undoubtedly lawful
marriage, and to such as are born afterwards, where their legitimacy has been
satisfactorily established, and their title to succession proved to be legal.
Hence anyone who has been appointed a new heir, and who has been placed in
possession of the estate, can enjoy the property of the others without fear of
molestation, until he arrives at the age of puberty.
Given on the fourth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of
Theodosius, Consul for the third time, and Habundantius, 293.
TITLE XVIII. CONCERNING THE SUCCESSION UNDE VIR ET UXOR.
1. The Emperors Theodosii's and Valentinian to Hierius, Praetorian Prefect.
A husband and wife succeed one another reciprocally, as heirs at law to their
entire estates, in accordance with the terms of the ancient laws, whenever
neither has any ascendants or descendants, or any other lawful or natural
relatives, to the exclusion of the Treasury.1
1 The law of descent in England, derived from the Feudal System, always gave
the preference to males, and allowed the widow nothing but her dower, the
marriage gift, and the third part of whatever had been acquired by the labor of
her husband and herself. This rule dates back to the Saxon domination. "Si quis
sine liberis decesserit, pater aut mater ejus in. hereditatem succedant; vel
frater aut soror, si pater aut mater desint; si nee has habeat, soror patris
vel matris; et deinceps, in quintum geniculum, quicunque propinquiores in
parentela fuerint, hereditario jure succedant; et dum virilis sexus extiterit,
et hereditas ab inde sit, femina non hereditetur."
"Si sponsa virum suum supervixerit, dotem et maritacionem suam, cartarum

Moreover, if the marriage took place without any dowry having been given, and
the husband or wife who dies first is wealthy, and the survivor is poor, the
latter, along with the common children or those of another marriage, will
succeed to one-fourth of the estate, where there are three children or less.
Where there are more than three, they will succeed to equal shares, so that the
property may be preserved for the issue of the same marriage if there is any;
or if there are no children living, or the survivor never had any, he or she
will acquire the ownership, and will be considered to have obtained his or her
share as a legacy.
TITLE XIX.
CONCERNING THE REJECTION OF THE POSSESSION OF THE PROPERTY OF AN ESTATE.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Theodosianus.
An emancipated person who has rejected the praetorian possession of an estate
will, in vain, attempt to again bring up the question, under the pretext that
his decision was made during the absence of his patron.
Without date or designation of consul.
2. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Theodorus.
A father will not be permitted to reject the possession of property given to
him by his son, for the purpose of defrauding the latter.
Given at Nicomedia, on the sixth of the Kalendsof December, during the
Consulate of the Csesars.
TITLE XX. CONCERNING HOTCHPOT.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Deuteria.
It is clearly a rule of law that emancipated children, who have been appointed
heirs by the will of their father, and have obtained the
gamgivam suam et terciam partem de omni collaboracione sua, preter vestes et
lectum suum; et si quid ex eis in elemosinis vel communi necessitate consump-
serit, nichil inde recipiat.
"Si mulier absque liberis moriatur, parentes ejus cum marito suo partem suam
dividant." (Leges Regis Henrici PrimiLXX, 20, 22, 23.) These regulations were
confirmed and extended by the laws of William the Conqueror. Under the English
rule inheritances never lineally ascend.
In many States of the Union, when either husband or wife dies intestate, and
without children or their direct descendants, the survivor is entitled to the
entire estate of the deceased, both real and personal.ED.
estate under it, are not compelled to contribute what was given to them by
their father as a donation to the common mass of the estate for the benefit of
their brothers, unless he provided by his last will that this should be done.
Given on the third of the Idesof July, during the Consulate of Julian, Consul
for the second time, and Crispinus, 225.
Extract from Novel 18, Chapter VI. Latin Text.
The hotchpot of the dowry and other gifts does not apply to estates left by
will, or which are ab intestato,even though the father should have expressly
directed that this should be the case. All other provisions which have been
made with reference to hotchpot remain in full force.
2. The Same to Primus.
If a father, dying intestate, should leave two sons, and a daughter in whose
name he had promised a dowry, the three children shall inherit equally, and the
dowry shall still be subject to hotchpot; so that the brothers will be released
from the necessity of furnishing it as heirs of their father
Given on the third of the Idesof September, during the Consulate of Julian,
Consul for the second time, and Crispinus, 225.
3. The Same Emperor to Alexander.
A clause included in a dotal instrument providing that the woman shall be
contented with the dowry given at marriage, and shall have no right to the
estate of her father, is disapproved by the law, and the daughter cannot for
this reason be prevented from succeeding to the estate of her father if he dies
intestate. She must, however, account to her brothers, who remained under the
control of their father, for the dowry which she received.
Given on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Agricola
and Clementinus, 231.
4. The Emperor Gordian to Marinus.
Daughters are required to bring their dowries into the common mass of the
estate only where they succeed to their father who died intestate, or demand
praetorian possession contrary to the provisions of the will. Nor is there any
doubt that a profectitious or adventitious dowry bestowed or constituted by the
father should be accounted for to the brothers who were under his control. It
has finally been decided, after many conflicting opinions have been given by
learned jurists, that those who did not die while members of the family will
only be entitled to hotchpot of the profectitious dowry.
Given on the fourth of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Gordian and
Aviola, 240.
5. The Same to Alexandria.
You have no right to demand the dowry during the existence of the marriage.
For, although your father died intestate, you should
account to your brother for your dowry, but you have not, on this ground, any
right of action against your husband to recover it, as you can set off the
share of the estate to which you are entitled against the
dowry.
Given on the Nonesof September, during the Consulate of Gordian
and Aviola, 240.
Extract from Novel 97, Chapter VI. Latin Text.
This law applies whether the husband is solvent or not, and if he is not, the
woman will be to blame for not having exacted her dowry during marriage
according to the Law of Justinian, when she saw that her husband was becoming
poor, which she could do, being her own mistress and of legal age.
When the mother gives the dowry, and the father consents to her doing so, the
daughter can sue to collect it. If her parents are dead, she can contribute her
right of action alone (even though it may be worthless) in order to recover the
dowry from the estate. This is the case when it is small, but where the dowry
subject to hotchpot is of considerable value, the daughter can exact it even
against the consent of her father.
These rules shall be observed whenever reason for hotchpot exists, even if the
succession to the estate of a grandmother is in dispute.
6. The Same to Claudius.
Emancipated brothers are accustomed to contribute, for the benefit of their
other brothers who remained under the control of their father, whatever
property belonged to them at the time that he died, of course, with the
exception of anything due from them to others.
Given on the seventh of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Peregrinus
and ^milianus, 245.
7. The Emperor Philip to Tymnnia.
It is an established rule of law that a daughter who was appointed heir by the
will of her father is not required to bring her dowry into the mass of the
estate for the benefit of her brothers, who are also her co-heirs, unless her
father expressly stated that this should be done.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Prsesens and
Albinus, 247.
8. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Calippus.
If your sister deceived you in the division of your father's estate, and did
not bring the dowry which she received from your father, who died intestate,
into the common mass of the same, the Governor of the province, after the
allegations of the parties have been examined, will order that the dowry shall
be included with the other property, and after having deducted the excess to
which he thinks she is entitled, shall direct it to be returned to you.
The same rule applies where a division has been made by the award of an
arbiter.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof July, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors.
9. The Same Emperors and Caesars to Onesimus.
If you have both been emancipated by your father, hotchpot will not be
required. If, however, your brother was under the control of your father at the
time of his death, and the latter left no will or any other final distribution
of his property, and it is proved that you were emancipated, and are entitled
to the estate of your father as heir at law, the terms of the Perpetual Edict
certainly call for hotchpot.
Given at Heraclea on the sixth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of
the Caesars.
10. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Hirena.
Where a daughter receives property left to her by a codicil of her father, or
from someone outside the family, she cannot be compelled to place her dowry in
the common mass of the estate, even though her father may have urged that this
be done.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
11. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Artemia.
When, by the birth of a posthumous child, who was passed over by his father,
the will of the latter is broken, and the child succeeds as heir, at law, it is
provided by the Perpetual Edict that an emancipated son shall contribute all
his property to the mass of the estate, after having demanded possession of the
same; for it is clearly shown that he would have been obliged to do so if the
child born subsequently had come to the world during the lifetime of his
father, and there is no doubt that all actions should be denied to emancipated
children if they do not make the contribution required by law.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors.
12. The Same and the Csesars to Philantea.
There is no question that hereditary actions should be refused to a daughter
who, although she was under the control of her father, refuses to account to
her brothers of the same family for the dowry which she had at the time of her
father's death. Wherefore, you should wisely Snd in accordance with law
contribute your dowry for the benefit of your brothers, who you state were
under the control of your common father when he died.
Moreover, as long as your brothers remain in the family of your father, they
will not be entitled' to their peculium,(unless it was castrense,or bequeathed
to them as a preferred legacy), but it must be brought into the common mass of
your father's estate to be divided; and it is an absolute and plain rule of law
that no change can be made
in any property derived from this source, and that it must remain in the same
condition in which it was originally.
Given on the eleventh of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
13. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Antistia.
If you acquired a tract of land by donation after the death of your father,
your sister cannot claim your share of the same; but if it was given to you by
your father, while you were under his control, as you with your sister succeed
to the estate of your common father, your demand to hold said property as a
preferred legacy is contrary to law.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof February, during the Consulate of the
Cffisars.
14. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Stratonica.
If your former husband became the heir at law of your father, and his
posthumous child succeeded you, the Governor will not hesitate to refuse the
hereditary actions to the aunt of your son, to which she was entitled at the
time of the death of her father, if she does not bring her dowries to the mass
of the estate.
Given on the seventh of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Tuscus and
Anulinus, 295.
15. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Philip.
Emancipated children are not compelled to contribute property which they have
acquired after the death of their common father, but, retaining the same, they
will be entitled to their hereditary share of their father's estate.
Given on the Idesof December, during the Consulate of the Csesars,
297.
16. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Socrates.
It has been held, with the greatest propriety, that a daughter, who with her
brothers, succeeded as co-heirs to her father, who died intestate, cannot
recover anything by an action in partition, if she does not contribute her
dowry to the mass of the estate, in addition to what her father may have left
her by a codicil.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
Csesars, 297.
17. The Emperor Leo to Erythrius, Prsetorian Prefect.
In order that children of either the male or female sex, whether they are their
own masters or are under the control, and entitled by any right whatsoever to
the intestate succession of their father, that is to say, because no will was
made, or if one was made, on account of having demanded praetorian possession
contrary to its provisions, or if it has been set aside in consequence of being
attacked as inofficious, may be treated alike and with justice, We have thought
that,
in the interests of equity, it should be inserted into the present law that in
dividing the property of parents who have died intestate, a dowry as well as an
ante-nuptial donation should be placed in the mass of the estate, whether the
father or mother, the grandfather or grandmother, the great-grandfather or the
great-grandmother, on either the paternal or the maternal side, gave or
promised the dowry or ante-nuptial donation in behalf of either a son or a
daughter, a grandson or a granddaughter, or a great-grandson or a great-
granddaughter.
No exception shall be made, whether the above-mentioned relatives contributed a
donation to the wives in behalf of their children, or to the husbands in behalf
of theirs, in order that the said donation might enure to the benefit of their
wives, so that in the division of the property of the father who died
intestate, and whose estate is in question, the said dowry or ante-nuptial
donation must be brought into the mass of his estate.
As it has been provided by the terms of former laws, in the case of children of
both sexes who have been emancipated, whatever property they acquired from
their parents at the time of their emancipation, as is customary, or what they
may have obtained from them after emancipation, must be placed in the common
mass of the estate.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Buscus and
John, 467.
18. The Emperor Anastasius to Constantine, Prtetorian Prefect.
We order that children who, by the authority of Our law, can become their own
masters through petitions presented to Us, and by virtue of Imperial Rescripts,
shall be ordered to make contribution to the common mass of the estate, in the
same manner as others who have been emancipated in accordance with the ancient
laws, in conformity with those provisions which have been enacted with
reference to other emancipated persons.
Given at Constantinople, on the twelfth of the Kalendsof August, during the
Consulate of Probus and Avienus the Younger.
19. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Praetorian Prefect.
We have thought it proper to completely remove the doubt which has arisen with
reference to the hotchpot of a dowry or ante-nuptial donation, and which has
already been thoroughly discussed by certain persons. For, if a man should die
intestate, and leave one or several sons, or one or several daughters, and any
of said daughters should die, leaving a number of grandchildren of either sex;
or if, on the other hand, a woman should die intestate in like manner, leaving
one or several sons, or one or several daughters, and any of said sons or
daughters should die, leaving a number of grandchildren of either sex, and
there was no doubt whatever about the succession, it was clear that the
grandchildren are entitled to two-thirds of the estate of their father or
mother, and that the other third should be reserved for their paternal or
maternal uncles or aunts, as has already been provided by a former
constitution.
With reference, however, to the hotchpot of the dowry or antenuptial donation
which the defunct person had given for his or her surviving daughter, and in
behalf of his or her deceased son or daughter, serious doubt arose. For the
surviving children of the decedent contended that they were not obliged to
surrender the dowry or ante-nuptial donation which had been given for their
benefit, by their father or mother, to be placed in the estate, and shared by
the children of their deceased brother or sister, on the ground that no
constitution had been promulgated with reference to a contribution of
this kind.
On the other hand, however, the grandchildren of the deceased not only disputed
this, but even asserted that the burden of contribution was imposed by the
Constitution of the Emperors Arcadius and Honorius, of Divine memory, only upon
maternal uncles, and did not apply to paternal uncles, or to paternal or
maternal aunts. Therefore, for the sake of disposing of this subtle
distinction, We order that not only the sons and daughters of a deceased person
shall also contribute to the mass of the estate any dowry or ante-nuptial
donation given to them by their parents, for the benefit of the grandchildren
of both sexes, who were the children of the deceased person, but that the said
grandsons and granddaughters shall also contribute in like manner to the
estates of their paternal or maternal uncles, or paternal and maternal aunts,
any dowry or ante-nuptial donation which they may have received from their
father or mother, in order that all these contributions, having been mingled
with the mass of the estate of the deceased, the children or grandchildren may
obtain two-thirds of the portion of the same which their fathers or mothers
would have had if they had lived, and that the third share shall, together with
that to which they themselves are entitled, go to the sons or daughters of the
deceased person whose estate is concerned.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of Our
Lord Justinian, Consul for the second time, 528.
Extract from Novel 18, Chapter IV. Latin Text.
This diminution of the third of the estate is altered by the new law, which
requires an equal distribution in the case of all such persons.
20. The Same to Menna, Prxtorian Prefect.
We hereby explain clearly a matter which has unreasonably been brought into
controversy by certain authorities; namely, that all property included in the
legitimate fourth share of an intestate succession shall, by all means, be
brought into hotchpot for the benefit of their co-heirs by those who bring suit
on the ground of the will being inofficious, even if they are called to the
estate of the person who died intestate. This shall not only apply to other
property, but also to that acquired by one of the heirs by means of the money
of the deceased, who served in the army; so that the profit which he obtained
at the time of the death of the soldier, whether the latter executed a
will or died intestate, shall be charged to the fourth part of the estate, and
be contributed to the common mass of the same.
The rule also, that all the property composing the fourth legitimate portion
shall be brought into hotchpot in case of intestacy, will by no means hold in
the contrary case, so that anyone can say that all the property contributed
should, by all means, be included in the fourth portion of those who instituted
proceedings against the will as inofficious, as only such property should be
included in the said portion as is expressly stated by the laws can be done.
(1) As the question arose whether an ante-nuptial donation or
dowry given by a father, mother, or other relative in behalf of a son
or daughter, a grandson or a granddaughter, or any other descendants,
shall be liable to hotchpot, if any one of the children before marriage
had received or should receive only an ante-nuptial donation or a
dowry, and not merely a simple donation, and another of either sex
had received or was entitled to receive neither an ante-nuptial donation
or dowry from either parent, but merely a simple gift, in order that
no injustice may be done, if the person who received the ante-nuptial
donation or dowry should be forced to account for it, and one who
had only received an ordinary donation should not be compelled to
place it in the mass of the estate, if anything of this kind should occur,
We order that the said person shall be compelled to account for the
same, just as in the case of one who had received an ante-nuptial
donation or a dowry, and that also the one to whom no dowry or
ante-nuptial donation had been given, but who merely received an
ordinary present from his or her parents, shall account for it; nor
can he or she refuse to do so on the ground that an ordinary gift is
not placed in hotchpot, except where the donor imposed a condition
of this kind at the time when it is donated.
Given at Constantinople, on the eighth of the Idesof August, during the
Consulate of Decius, 529.
21. The Same to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
In order that no one may hereafter entertain any doubt with reference to
contributions of this kind, We have considered it necessary to add the
following provision to the Constitution which We have already promulgated in
favor of children, namely, to forbid that property partially acquired by
parents should be subject to hotchpot between children after their death. For
as in the distribution of an estate they cannot be compelled by the terms of a
former law to place any castrense peculiumin its common mass, so We decree that
any other property which has not been wholly acquired by the parents shall also
belong to the children.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof November, during the fifth Consulate of
Lampadius and Orestes, 530.


TITLE XXI. CONCERNING THE WILL OF A SOLDIER.

1. The Emperor Antoninus to the Soldier Floras.
If your brother, while a soldier, appointed you his heir, especially for
property which he had at home, you cannot claim that which he left in the camp,
even if he who was appointed heir of the same refuses to accept it. But those
entitled to the estate become his heirs at law, provided no one has been
substituted in the place of the said heir, and it is clearly proved that your
brother did not consent that the castrensian property should go to you, for the
will of a soldier in active service is observed as law.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof September, during the Consulate
of the two Aspers, 213.

2. The Same to the Soldier Septimus.
When a soldier appointed a comrade of his heir only to his castrensian
property, his mother will be entitled by law to all his other possessions, on
the ground of his dying intestate. If, however, he appointed a foreign heir,
and he accepted the estate, your demand that his property be transferred to you
is contrary to law.
Given on the eleventh of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of
Antoninus, Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.

3. The Same to Vindicianus.
Although the wills of soldiers are not subject to the ordinary legal
formalities, as, on account of military simplicity, they are permitted to make
them in any way they desire, and in any way they can, still, the testamentary
disposition made by the late Valerian is based upon the authority of the Common
Law. For as, being the head of a household, he appointed his daughter heir to
two-twelfths of his estate, and his wife heir to one-twelfth, but did not make
any disposition of the remaining portion, it is clear that he divided his
estate into three parts, with the evident intention that she should have two-
thirds who received two-twelfths, and that she who was appointed heir to one-
twelfth should obtain the remaining third.
Given during the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of Antoninus, Consul
for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.

4. The Emperor Alexander to Junius.
If Rufinus, an illustrious tribune of senatorial rank, after having arrived at
his majority, made a will and manumitted you, you should know that you are
entitled to your lawful freedom. If, however, he was under the age prescribed
by law when he executed his will, you cannot obtain your freedom, as it was
given contrary to law, for, under such circumstances, the legal restitution is
not abolished in favor of a soldier. If, however, the said testator had
intended to manumit you, and it was his probable intention to do so during his
lifetime, for the reason that freedom should be given when conferred
by the terms of a trust by a minor of any age, and if his said intention can be
proved, the result will be that slaves are legally entitled to their freedom
under a military will of this kind.
Given on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of
Alexander, 224.

5. The Same Emperors to Sozomenus.
Hence an estate and legacies are due to those to whom they have been bequeathed
by the will of a soldier, whether he was still in the service, or they were
left within a year after he was honorably discharged, because, among other
privileges granted to soldiers, they are freely permitted to bequeath their
property by their wills to whomever they may select, unless the law expressly
forbids them to do so.
Given on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of
Julian, Consul for the second time, and Crispinus, 225.

6. The Same Emperor to Valentine.
Where anyone, who is not a soldier, appointed two heirs by his will, for one of
whom his father had the right to make a will up to the time when he arrived at
puberty, and for the other he would not be able to make substitution, if he
afterwards became the heir, as it had been made reciprocally by the terms of
the will, it has been established by the opinions of persons learned in the law
and by the constitutions of My Divine ancestors, which apply to a case of this
kind alone, that he who executed the will could make a reciprocal substitution
of the said heirs, and that they both stood on the same footing.
But as the controversy to which you allude has reference to a military will by
which you were appointed heir with reciprocal substitution, conjointly with his
little daughter who afterwards died, and her mother claimed the estate of her
daughter for herself on the ground of intestacy, and you assert that it belongs
to you, because of the substitution which was made, the rule of law is clear
that soldiers are permitted by a peculiar privilege to substitute foreign heirs
for their own heirs, in case the latter should die, but you must prove that
this was your brother's intention.
Given on the eleventh of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Fuscus,
Consul for the second time, and Dexter, 226.

7. The Same Emperor to Fortunatus.
You cannot claim your freedom on account of the words, "I give and bequeath to
my freedman, Fortunatus," if this is inserted in the will of someone who is not
a soldier. But if, as you allege, the testator was a soldier, and did this with
the intention of granting you freedom, and not because he erroneously believed
you to be free, you will indeed be entitled to your liberty directly, and to
the right to claim the legacy by virtue of the peculiar privilege to which
soldiers are entitled.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Alexander, Consul for the second time, and Marcellus, 227.

8. The Emperor Gordian to the Soldier JEternus.
It is a certain rule of law that a soldier can appoint an heir for a
specified time.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate
of Pius and Pontianus, 239.

9. The Same Emperor to Valerius.
It is also well established by law that where a soldier, being aware that he
had a son, appointed other heirs, he is understood to have tacitly disinherited
him, just as when, being ignorant that he has a son, he appoints other heirs,
the said son will not be deprived of his estate; but the will will be void if
the son is under his control, and there is no doubt that he will be entitled to
the estate.
Given on the fifth of the Nonesof October, during the Consulate of Pius and
Pontianus, 239.

10. The Emperor Philip and the Csesar Philip to the Soldier Justinus.
When an unborn daughter has been passed over in the will of her father who is a
soldier, or where the father thought that she was dead, .in consequence of a
false report, and did not mention her in his will, silence under these
circumstances does not, by any means, cause disinheritance. But if the soldier
who appointed his daughter in his will left her a legacy, but did not appoint
her his heir, he disinherited her.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate
of Prsesens and Albinus, 247.

11. The Same Emperors and C&sars to the Soldier JEmilianus.
It is clear that the appointment of heirs who have been solicited to become
such even by the will of a soldier are of no force or effect.
Given on the seventh of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Praesens
and Albinus, 247.

12. The Same Emperors and Csssars to Domitia.
It is a well-established rule of law that in the will of a soldier the
Falcidian Law does not apply to legacies and trusts. If, however, a claim
should be made for more than the amount of the estate, you can protect yourself
by a competent defence.
Given on the sixth of the Nonesof July, during the Consulate of Praesens and
Albinus, 247.

13. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus to Claudia.
Our soldiers and centurions who have been convicted of military offences are
only permitted to make wills disposing of their cas-trensian property, and the
remainder goes to the Treasury by the
right of intestacy.
Given on the Nonesof August, during the Consulate of Valerian and Gallienus,
Consuls for the third and second time, respectively, 256.

14. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximum to the Heirs of Maximus.
If your mother, having been appointed heir by her brother who was a soldier,
obtained the estate for herself, although the will did not conform to the
requirements of the law, it is legally settled that, nevertheless, neither the
brother of the testator nor his children can evict her from the estate on the
ground of intestacy.
Given on the fifth of the Nonesof May, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors.

15. The Emperor Constantine to the People.
Where soldiers in active service wish to appoint their wives, children, or
friends, or any other persons whomsoever, their testamentary heirs, they can do
so in any way which they can, or desire; and neither the merit, the freedom,
nor the rank of their wives or children shall be called in question when they
produce the will of their father. Hence it is permitted, and always shall be
permitted by the rules of law, that, if they have written their intentions on
the scabbards of their swords, or on their shields, with the crimson letters of
their own blood, or have traced them in the dust with the points of their
swords, at the time when they were dying in battle, a will of this kind shall
be valid.
Given at Nicomedia on the third of the Idesof August, during the Consulate of
Optatus and Paulinus, 334.

16. The Emperor Anastasius to Hierus, Praetorian Prefect.
We order that the secretaries and attendants who draw up the papers, or obey
the orders of the officers of the army, shall by no means have the power to
make last wills for themselves, in accordance with military law, even though
their names appear to be inscribed upon the rolls of the army.
Given at Constantinople, on the Idesof February, under the fifth Consulate of
Paulus, 496.

17. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Prietorian Prefect.
In order that all those attached to the army may not think that they are
permitted to make their wills at any time and in any way that they desire, We
order that the above-mentioned privilege of executing last wills shall be
granted to those alone who are in active military service.
Given on the fourth of the Idesof April, during the fifth Consulate of Decius,
529.

18. The Same Emperor to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
Although minors who had obtained the rank of tribune were permitted by the
ancient laws to make last wills, still, it appears to be unworthy of Our aid
that one whose judgment is not yet mature should, by reason of military
privilege, enjoy the rights of men of full discretion, and while at such tender
age, through the exertion of a con-
cession of this kind, perhaps injure his parents or other relatives by leaving
his property to strangers. Therefore, We order that this shall under no
circumstances be done.
Given during the Kalendsof November, after the fifth Consulate of Lampadius and
Orestes, 532.

TITLE XXII. WHO CAN MAKE A WILL AND WHO CANNOT.
1. The Emperor Gordian to the Soldier Petronius.
Although as your father-in-law and his brother are partners in all the property
belonging to you, still, the brother of your father-in-law, at the time of his
death, was able to appoint anyone whom he wished his testamentary heir.
Likewise, he was not deprived of the right to make a will, for the reason that
it is alleged that the estate in which he was jointly interested with his
sister was as yet undivided.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Arianus
and Pappus, 244.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Viator and Pontia.
If he who appointed you his heir, along with his wife, was of sound mind at the
time when he executed his will, and was not afterwards oppressed with the
consciousness of some crime, but committed suicide on account of his being
incapable of enduring pain, or while impelled by an attack of insanity, and his
innocence can be clearly established by you, his last will should not be
rejected under the pretext of his voluntary death. If, influenced by the fear
of future punishment, he anticipated it by suicide, the laws forbid that his
last will shall be
considered valid.
Given on the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
3. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Licinius.
It is certain that persons of advanced age who are suffering from bodily
disease cannot be deprived of the right of testation, provided they are of
sound mind. It is, however, a positive rule of law that a son who is under
paternal control cannot make a will.
Given on the fourth of the Nonesof April, under the Consulate of the Csesars.
4. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Rado.
As your first cousin died before reaching his fourteenth year, and hence did
not have testamentary capacity, nothing can legally be demanded by virtue of
his last will. But if, having passed the abovementioned age, even though the
evidences of his virility may not yet have appeared, he executed a last will in
compliance with the formalities of the law, you will, in vain, attempt to have
it set aside.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof November, during the Consulate of the Caesars.
5. The Emperor Constantius to Rufinus, Prsetorian Prefect.
Eunuchs, like everyone else, shall be permitted to execute wills and make final
distribution of their property, and also to draw up codicils, provided that all
the formalities required in the execution of wills are observed.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Constantius,
Consul for the fifth time, and the Caesar Constans, 339.
6. The Same Emperor to Volusius, Prsetorian Prefect.
If anyone should appoint the Emperor his heir, he shall, in accordance with the
laws relating to wills, have the power to change his will, and appoint anyone
else whom he may wish.
Given at Milan, on the twelfth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of
Arbitio and Lollianus, 355.
7. The Emperors Valens, Valentinian, and Gratian to Maximus.
When the Emperor or the Empress are appointed heirs, they are subject to the
same laws as other persons. The same rule shall be observed in the execution of
codicils, and the creation of trusts legally drawn up on the form of letters.
And (as was provided by former laws) both the Emperor and the Empress have a
right to make and change their own wills.
Given on the seventh of the Idesof August, during the Consulate of Gratian,
Consul for the second time, and Probus, 371.
8. The Emperor Justinian to Demosthenes, Prastorian Prefect.
We order by this well-considered law that persons who have become blind either
through disease or accident can dispose of their property by verbal wills,
provided seven witnesses as well as a notary are present, which is required by
law when other wills are executed, all of them having been collected in the
same place expressly for this purpose, and notified by the testator that a
nuncupative will is to be made. The names of the heirs should then be
specifically mentioned, as well as the rank of each, and all other information
necessary to prevent the mere mention of their names from causing any ambiguity
to arise. It should also be stated what the share of each shall be, how many
parts of the estate they will be permitted to have, and how much the testator
wishes each legatee or beneficiary of a trust to receive; and finally,
everything should be enumerated which is included in the list of final
dispositions authorized by law.
All these matters having been mentioned in their order at one and the same time
and place, and the will having been drawn up by the hand of the notary in the
presence of seven witnesses, as previously stated, and having been signed by
their hands, and the said witnesses, as well as the notary, having duly sealed
the instrument, it shall obtain full authority as the will of the testator.
These formalities should be
observed in the same manner, even though no heirs are appointed, but legacies
or trusts are alone bequeathed, or the document executed resembles a codicil.
But, as human weakness is, above all, troubled by the thought of death, and
memory may not be able to recall many things at once, permission is hereby
given to such persons to entrust to whomever they may select the duty of
drawing up their wills or codicils; so that the witnesses and the notary having
been assembled in the same place, and they (as previously stated) having been
informed for what purpose they were brought together, the instrument shall be
produced, and shall be read by the notary to the testator and the witnesses, in
order that its contents may be known to all, and that the testator may
acknowledge it as his last will, and declare that it was his intention to make
the dispositions which have been read; and finally, the signatures as well as
the seals of the witnesses, and the notary, as has been previously stated,
shall be affixed to the instrument. But as there may not be a notary in all
places where his presence is desired, We order that when one cannot be found,
an eighth witness shall take his place, and what We have provided shall be done
by the notary in the manner aforesaid shall be performed by the eighth witness;
and free power is hereby granted to all persons executing wills in the manner
aforesaid to commit the document signed and sealed in this manneras the
preceding rules prescribeto any one of the witnesses for safe-keeping. We have
provided for this to be done, not only that persons who are blind may have
testamentary capacity, but in order that there may be no ground for fraud, the
will having been seen by so many eyes, understood by so many minds, and above
all placed in safe hands.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of
Justinian and Valerius, 521.
9. The Emperor Justinian to Julian, Praetorian Prefect.
It has been decided by Us, and by the Princes who have preceded Us, that an
insane person can execute a will during a lucid interval, although this was
doubted by the ancient authorities. The following question must be decided now
(and this, in like manner, exercised the wits of the ancients), namely: what
course should be taken if insanity should again attack a testator after he has
begun to make his will? Therefore, We order that a will of this kind, where the
testator became insane while in the very act of making it, shall be void. If,
however, he should, during a lucid interval, wish to execute a will, or make
any final disposition of his estate, and, being all the time of sound mind and
without the return of his affliction he began and finished the will, or other
final disposition of his estate, We decree that it shall stand, provided all
the formalities required by law in instruments of this kind were observed.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof September, during the fifth Consulate
of Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
10. The Same Emperor to John, Praetorian Prefect.
With reference to persons who are either deaf or dumb, for the reason that
these defects are generally found together, We order that if anyone is, at the
same time, afflicted with both of them, by having been born in that condition,
so that he is unable to either hear or speak, he cannot make a will nor a
codicil, nor lease a trust, nor be permitted to make a donation mortis causa,or
grant freedom, either by the wand of the Praetor, or in any other way, and We
direct that males as well as females shall be subject to this law.
Where, however, a misfortune of this kind, not derived from nature, but from
disease resulting after birth, afflicts either a male or female, and deprives
them of the power of speech, and closes their ears, if We assume that such a
person knows how to read and write, We permit him to do everything which We
have above forbidden, if he can inscribe it with his own hand. But when the
misfortune is single, which rarely happens, We allow one who is deaf, although
naturally this sense is different in degree, to perform all acts having
reference to wills, codicils, donations mortis causa,grants of freedom and all
other matters of this kind.
Where, however, the power of articulate speech has been granted him by nature,
nothing shall prevent him from doing everything that he wishes; because We know
that certain persons learned in the law have very properly been of the opinion,
and have stated that no one is absolutely deaf who hears when spoken to near
the head, which is in accordance with what was held by Jubentius Celsus. So far
as he whom an attack of disease has deprived of hearing is concerned, it cannot
be doubted that he can perform any legal act without hindrance.
In the case of one whose ears are open, and who can understand speech, but who
has almost no use of his tongue (although this point was frequently discussed
by the ancient authorities), still, if We suppose such a person knows how to
write, he will not be prevented from drawing up all kinds of instruments, if he
writes them out with his own hand, whether he has been afflicted with this
misfortune by nature or by an attack of disease.
No distinction with reference to males or females shall be observed in the
interpretation of this entire constitution.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof March, after the
fifth Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
11. The Same to John, Praetorian Prefect.
Let no one think that any alteration should be made in the law which We have
recently promulgated concerning property which cannot be acquired by parents,
or that children under paternal control, of any degree or sex whatsoever, can
make wills, whether they are the possessors of property without the consent of
their fathers, in accordance with the distinction established in the provisions
of Our law, or whether they have their consent to hold it, for under no
circumstances do We permit them to do so; but the ancient law which does not
concede testamentary capacity to children under paternal control
except in certain cases, and which also has reference to others to whom power
of this kind has already been granted, shall be absolutely
observed.
Given at Constantinople, during the Kalendsof September, after the fifth
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
12. The Same to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
All those persons who are permitted by the laws to have quasi castrense
peculiashall have permission only to dispose of such property by their last
wills in accordance with the terms of Our Constitution, which affords immunity
from a complaint of inofficiousness to testaments of this description.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Nonesof December, after the fifth
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.

TITLE XXIII.
CONCERNING WILLS, AND IN WHAT WAY THEY SHOULD BE DRAWN UP.

1. The Emperor Hadrian to Catonius.  It need not be discussed in this
case whether the witnesses are slaves or freemen, as at the time when
the will was sealed, the witnesses were present with the consent of
all the children, and no one, up to this time, has raised any
controversy with reference to their condition.  Without date or
designation of consul.

2. The Emperor Alexander to Expeditus.  Where a will has once been
published, it is none the less valid, even though the instrument
itself, in which the written bequest was made by the testator, is
proved to have been destroyed by accident.  Given on the Kalendsof
June, during the Consulate of Fuscus and Dexter, 226.

3. The Same Emperor to Antigonus.
It has frequently been decided that even the Emperor cannot claim an estate
under an imperfect will, for although the jurisprudence of the Empire exempts
the sovereign from complying with the ordinary legal formalities, still, no
duty is so incumbent upon him as to live in obedience to the laws.
Given on the eleventh of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of Lupus
and Maximus, 233.

4. The Emperor Gordian to Rufinus.
If the testator made a mistake in the name, title, surname, or family
designation, but no uncertainty exists as to what he intended, an error of this
kind will not in any way affect the truth.

5. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus to Lucillus.
Neither the statement nor the assurance made by testators, when appointing
heirs, that certain persons are their children, when they are not, will
prejudice the truth, and it is a positive rule of law that property bequeathed
to persons as children who are not such, is not due, according to what has been
decided by the Emperors.
Given on the sixth of the Nonesof July, during the Consulate of Valerian,
Consul for the third time, and Gallienus, Consul for the second time, 226.

6. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Terentia.
The terms of a will by which your mother, at the time of her death, stated that
she had donated nothing to anyone, will not affect the truth, if the case
should be found to be otherwise.
Given on the third of the Nonesof November, during the Consulate of Diocletian
and Aristobolus, 285.

7. The Same Emperors to Rufina.
The formal effect of the law can never be annulled by an error occurring in a
written will, for it is regarded rather as nuncupative than written. Hence,
where a will is properly drawn up, although the words "Let him be my heir," are
lacking, the result is that the legal heir will be obliged to pay the legacies,
or execute the trusts, in accordance with the intention of the testator.
Given on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of
Diocletian, Consul for the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third
time, 290.

8. The Same Emperors to Marcellinus.
The strictness of the law is somewhat relaxed in a case where one of the
witnesses, on account of a serious and unusual occurrence, is attacked by a
contagious disease, which deters others from acting, still, the remaining
formalities attending the execution of the will should not be absolutely
abandoned. Witnesses who are attacked by a disease of this kind are excused
from assembling and associating with one another, for the time; but the rule
for calling together the legal number of witnesses to a will must be observed.
Given on the sixteenth of the Kalends ofJuly, during the Consulate of
Diocletian, Consul for the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third
time, 290.

9. The Same to Patroclia.
If the formalities of the law of your country were not relaxed by a special
privilege in favor of the testator, and the witnesses did not perform their
duties as such in his presence, the will is void.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors, 290.

10. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Menophelimus.
Ifa will has been legally executed, and the heir is capable of receiving the
estate, the will cannot be rescinded by the authority of Our Rescript.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.

11. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Zeno.A will which has been executed in
accordance with law is none the less valid, if it is proved to have been
abstracted after the death
of the testator.
Given on the day before the Idesof November, during the Consulate
of the above-mentioned Emperors.

12. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Matrona.
If one of the witnesses necessary is lacking, or if all the witnesses have not
attached their seals to the will in the same place and in the presence of the
testator, using for that purpose their own rings, or those of others, the will
is void in law.
With reference to the erasures and additions to which you refer, they do not
affect the requirements of the law, but they raise the question of good faith;
so that it must be established whether the said corrections and erasures were
made at the suggestion of the testator, or were caused undesignedly by another,
or are to be attributed to the fraudulent act of someone else.
Given at Philippopolis, on the day before the Nonesof July, during the
Consulate of the above-mentioned Emperors.

13. The same Emperors and Csesars to Euryphida.
Although the power to make a will for the purpose of disposing of anyone's
property is granted by certain laws, no one is permitted to change the form of
jurisdiction, or to derogate from the public law.

14. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Achilleus.The appointment and
disinheritance of heirs made by your grandmother evidently proves that she
intended to execute a will, and not a
codicil.
Given on the Idesof December, during the Consulate of the Csesars.

15. The Emperor Constantine to the People.
For the reason that it is unworthy that the last wills and dispositions of
estates by persons who are deceased should become void on account of the
failure to observe a vain technicality, it has been decided that those
formalities shall be abolished whose use is only imaginary, and that, in the
appointment of an heir, a particular form of words is not required, whether
this be done by imperative and direct expressions, or by terms which are
indefinite. For it makes no difference whether the terms "I make you my heir,"
or "I appoint you my heir," or "I wish," or "I desire you to be my heir," or
"Be my heir," or "So-and-So shall be my heir," are employed; but no matter in
what words the appointment is made, or in what form of speech it is stated, it
shall be valid, provided the intention of the testator is clearly shown by the
language used. Nor are the words which a dying and stammering tongue pours
forth necessarily of importance.
Therefore, in the execution of last wills, the requirement of formal
expressions is hereby abolished, and those who desire to dispose of their own
property can write their wills upon any kind of material whatsoever, and are
freely permitted to use any words which they may desire.
Given on the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of the Emperors
Constantius and Constans, 339.

16. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Eutro-pius, Praetorian
Prefect.
It is neither doubtful nor uncertain that an estate, as well as a legacy or a
trust, can be left to persons invested with any office or authority, just as
they can be left to Emperors. It must also be added that where one who becomes
either the testamentary or legal heir of another, although the will of the
deceased may not have been executed in conformity with the laws relating to
legacies, trusts, or grants of freedom, still, if he acknowledged it
voluntarily as his own, the heir will be obliged to carry it out.
Given at Thessalonica, on the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Gratian,
Consul for the fifth time, and Theodosius, 380.

17. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to &ternalis, Proconsul of Asia.
A will should not be considered void for the reason that the testator mentioned
persons therein by different names, as what is superfluous does not cause any
injury, for where what is necessary is omitted, it affects the validity of
contracts and thwarts the intention of the testator, but abundant caution does
not do so.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Arcadius,
Consul for the fourth time, and Honorius, Consul for the third time, 396.

18. The Same Emperors to Africanus, Prefect of the City.
All wills and other documents, which are usually published in the presence of
the Superintendent of the Census, shall always be kept in the same place, nor
shall any transfer of them ever be permitted to be made; for the custom of
antiquity should be carefully observed, and if anyone in this City should
attempt to change it, he will be considered to have the intention of
invalidating the will of the deceased.
Given at Constantinople, on the twelfth of the Kalendsof October, during the
Consulate of Caesarius and Atticus, 397.

19. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
He who has notified the Emperor of the execution of his will is considered to
be released from complying with all the formalities required in wills, for the
reason that the testimony of the Emperor, as well as that of the noble and
distinguished members of his household, dispenses with their observance.
Therefore, he will rest secure who
publishes his last will by placing it on record before any judge, or municipal
magistrate, or by entrusting it to the ears of private persons; as no dispute
can arise with reference to a succession, where an heir is appointed in Our
presence, and in entire accordance with the law established by Our Council.
Nor, indeed, do We permit the rights of heirs to be prejudiced where no
rescript has been issued by Us with reference to said will, for We wish to hear
the last wills of testators and not to order them, lest, after Our opinion has
been rendered, any charges in them may appear to have been prohibited; since
that which has been communicated to Our ears by means of a petition must be
confirmed, if it is proved to be a last will, and the deceased is subsequently
shown to have done nothing contrary to its
provisions.
And in order that We may not be thought to have omitted anything, We order that
the heirs appointed in this way shall have all those rights which written heirs
are entitled to enjoy, and that no controversy shall be permitted to arise with
reference to a claim for the possession of an estate, since it is sufficient
for all things to be done by anyone as an heir, and the acceptance of the
estate is considered to comply with all the provisions of the law.
We decree, then, that all those who have testamentary capacity shall be
permitted freely to appoint their heirs by the presentation of a petition to
the Emperor, and when this is the case, they are hereby informed that what they
have done is valid.
Nor shall an appointed heir be under any apprehension, if he can prove by
competent witnesses that he has presented a petition in compliance with the
will of the deceased, provided other matters cannot prejudice him.
Given at Ravenna, on the twelfth of the Kalendsof March, after the Consulate of
Honorius, Consul for the eighth time, and Theodosius, 499.

20. Edict of the Same Emperors Addressed to the People of the City of
Constantinople, and all the Inhabitants of the Provinces.
We are unwilling that wills which have been drawn up in accordance with the
legal formalities should be declared void on the ground that the testator
subsequently made another which was not in writing, even if at the time of his
death he desired that We should have his estate. We forbid all persons,
including soldiers, to give testimony of this kind, and We order that they
shall be guilty of perjury where, when the wills of deceased persons have been
drawn up properly with all the solemnities required by law, they falsely
attempt to add anything not in writing, by mentioning Our name.
Therefore, let no one who has been appointed an heir, or who has been called to
the succession by law, be alarmed at the mention of Our name or of that of any
powerful person; and let no one dare to furnish evidence for this purpose, or
hear any statements with reference to matters of this kind, in Our name, or in
that of any private person in authority.
Given at Constantinople, on the seventh of the Idesof March, during the
Consulate of Theodosius, Consul for the seventh time, and Palladius, 407.

21. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Florentius, Praetorian Prefect.
We order by this carefully considered law that those who make a written will
and do not wish anyone to know what is contained therein, shall seal it, tie
it, roll it up, or conceal the writing in any other manner, whether it has been
written by the hand of the testator himself, or by that of someone else; and,
then, having called together seven Roman citizens, who have arrived at puberty,
shall oifer the said will to them all at the same time to be signed and sealed,
provided, however, that the testator shall say to the said witnesses that the
instrument which he offers is his will, and shall sign it with his own hand in
their presence. This having been done and the witnesses having signed and
sealed the will on one and the same day, and at the same time, it shall be
valid, and shall not be rendered void for the reason that the witnesses did not
know what was written therein. When, however, the testator does not know how,
or is unable to write his name, We decree that an eighth witness, having been
called in by him for that purpose, can sign it in his stead.
Where wills are dictated in the presence of witnesses, it is useless to require
the testator to summon them, and dictate and complete his will at the same
time, for, although it may have been dictated and written at another time, it
will be sufficient for the witnesses all to sign and seal it together on the
same day, and not at different times, when no other instrument has been
executed. We decree that the attaching of the signatures and seals of the
witnesses shall indicate the completion of the will. It is settled that a will
which has not been signed and sealed by witnesses shall be considered as not
having been executed.

(1) We do not desire that the wishes of the deceased shall be carried out by an
imperfect will, unless this is done solely by a parent for the benefit of his
children of both sexes. When, however, any strangers, in addition to the
children, are interested in a will of this kind, it is certain that it must be
considered void only so far as they are concerned, and their shares shall
accrue to the children.
Extract from Novel 107, Chapter I. Latin Text.
Where a will is drawn up without having been signed, and the father, knowing
how to write, has put down with his own hand the date and the names of his
children, as well as the number of shares they are to receive, or has indicated
any particular property in said will, it shall be valid. He can, by a will of
this kind, bequeath legacies to strangers, as well as create trusts, and grant
freedom to slaves.
Extract from the Same Novel, Chapter II. Latin Text.
A will executed by a father for the benefit of his children will be revoked if
he declares in the presence of seven witnesses that he is
unwilling for it to stand, and makes another disposition of his estate, either
by a perfect will, or by a nuncupative one.
END OF THE AUTHENTIC EXTRACT.
THE TEXT OP THE CODE FOLLOWS.

(2) We order that a nuncupative will, that is to say one that is not written,
shall not be valid unless (as is above stated) seven witnesses are called
together at one and the same time, and hear that it is the intention of the
testator to make an unwritten will.

(3) When anyone, having executed a will with all the legal requirements,
afterwards desires to execute another, We decree that the former ones shall not
be revoked if the second one made by the testator was executed with the proper
formalities, unless persons were mentioned by the testator in the first will
who would not be entitled to the inheritance or succession in case of
intestacy, and in the second one he appointed those who could be called to the
succession of the estate as heirs at law. For, in this instance, although the
second will may appear to be imperfect, the first one having been revoked, We
order that the second shall not be considered a testament, but shall be valid
as the expression of the last wishes of the testator. The oaths of five sworn
witnesses shall be sufficient to establish the validity of a will of this
description. If this is not done, the first will shall be valid, although by it
strangers may have been appointed heirs.

(4) We deem it advisable to insert into this law that all persons shall be
permitted to write their wills in the Greek language.
Given on the Idesof September, during the Consulship of Theodosius, Consul for
the seventeenth time, and Festus, 439.

22. The Emperor Zeno to Sebastian, Prsetorian Prefect.
There is no doubt that a testator can leave to the person to whom he dictates
his will, or by any other method of disposing of his property, either a legacy,
a trust, or anything else which he can bequeath in a lawful way. Moreover, a
testator is not prevented from leaving whatever he pleases to the witnesses
called together at the time of the execution of his will.[[1]]

[[1 This principle has not been generally incorporated in modern systems of
jurisprudence. In England, a witness was disqualified who had a direct interest
either as legatee or creditor in the probate of the will. This was subsequently
modified by statute, and he was rendered competent by depriving him of any
benefit to which he may have been entitled by bequest, or otherwise.
"By the Stat. 25, G. II, c. 6, sec. I, it is enacted, that if any person shall
attest the execution of any will or codicil, to whom any beneficial devise,
legacy, &c, except charges on lands, &c, for payment of any debt shall be given
or made, such devise, legacy, &c, shall be void, and such person shall be
admitted as a witness to prove the execution of such will or codicil."
(Starkie, A Practical Treatise on the Law of Evidence, Vol. Ill, Sec. 1691.) A
similar provision was made by Stat.. I, Victoria, Ch. 26.
Legislation in the United States has, for the most part, followed the ancient
1 English rule. "Witnesses to a will are rendered incapable of taking any
beneficial
interest under it, except it be creditors whose debts, by the will, are made a

23. The Emperor Justinian to Archelaus, Praetorian Prefect.
We sanction the Imperial Rescripts by which it has been carefully provided that
the last wills of deceased persons, which have been executed in this Imperial
City, cannot be opened in the presence of anyone else than the illustrious
Superintendent of the Census in office at the time, the documents requisite for
that purpose having been properly drawn up; and it is hereby decreed that
neither those in control of the office of the census, nor anyone attached to
it, shall exact any fee or charge for expense with reference to an estate, in
the case of the registry of a will disposing of property which does not exceed
the value of a hundred aurei.
We now confirm the above regulations, and by the repetition of the same, decree
that not only the judges of all the tribunals, but also the defenders of the
churches, who have received documents for registry, shall be notified not to
meddle with any matters which, according to the provisions of all
constitutions, only belong to the jurisdiction of the Superintendent of the
Census. For it is absurd for the duties of officials to be interfered with
through the promiscuous transaction of business by others, and that one should
arrogate to himself the functions of another; and this is especially
reprehensible in the case of ecclesiastics, as it is a matter of reproach for
them to desire to be considered skilled in matters pertaining to the legal
profession. The penalty for persons violating the present law shall be a fine
of fifty pounds of gold. For it must not be permitted that the last wishes of
dying persons shall be thwarted by an illegal registry, when the functions of
the proper officials have been insolently usurped by persons not entitled to
discharge them.

the Consulate of Justin, Consul for the second time, and Opilio, 524.

597.)
Moslem law forbids a witness to be the beneficiary of any testamentary
disposition.
"The mutual evidence of parties on behalf of each other to debts due to each
from an estate is valid, but not their evidence to legacies, unless each legacy
respectively consists of a slave.
"A mutual evidence of this nature is void where it involves a right of
participation in the witnesses." (The Hedaya IV, LII, Vill.)

24. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Prsetorian Prefect.
We think that the doubts which may arise through the ignorance or negligence of
those who draw up wills should be removed, and therefore We do not grant
permission to anyone to overthrow the will of a testator, either because the
appointment of heirs has been made after the donation of legacies, or where any
other formality has been omitted, not intentionally by the testator, but
through the fault of the notary or of some other person who drew up the
document; and We decree that the will of the testator shall not be set aside or
altered on this account.
Given on the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of Our Lord Justinian,
Consul for the second time, 528.

25. The Same to Menna, Prsetorian Prefect.
We hereby remove the blame attaching to clauses inserted out of their regular
order, which a New Constitution of the Divine Leo is known to have sanctioned
in the case of dotal instruments, not only with reference to all contracts, but
also in the case of wills, so that where no exception can be pleaded, a
stipulation and other contracts, as well as the will of a testator, shall
unquestionably be valid; provided, of course, that the exaction of compliance
shall take place after the condition has been complied with, or the time has
elapsed.
Given on the seventh of the Idesof December, during the Consulate of Our Lord
Justinian, Consul for the second time, 528.

26. The Same Emperor to Menna, Prsetorian Prefect.
In the case of unwritten wills, We absolutely abolish the observation of all
verbal formalities, so thfat after the seven witnesses have assembled, it will
be sufficient for the will of the testator or testatrix to be communicated to
all at the same time, he or she indicating or designating to whom they desire
their estate to go; or to whom they wish to give legacies or trusts; or upon
whom they wish to confer freedom; even if, before a disposition of property of
this kind occurs, the testator or testatrix should not have made use of the
following formula, namely: "These witnesses have been called together in order
that they may attest the unwritten last will or testament which he intends to
execute."
Given at Constantinople, on the fourth of the Idesof December, during the
Consulate of Our Lord Justinian, Consul for the second time, 528.

27. The Same Emperor to Julian, Prietorian Prefect.
We order that where anyone makes a will in accordance with law, and the term of
ten years has elapsed since its execution, and no alteration or change of
intention by the testator has appeared, it shall be valid. For why should what
has not been changed be forbidden to stand? And why should a person who has
made a will, and revoked nothing in it, be declared intestate? If, however, in
the meantime, the testator is shown to have executed a second will, and it is
perfect in all respects, the first one is revoked by operation of law. But
where he merely stated that he did not wish his first will to stand, or by the
use of other words showed that he intended to revoke it, or manifested such an
intention either in the presence of not less than three competent witnesses, or
by means of some public document, and the term of ten years has elapsed, the
will shall then be void, as well on account of the change of intention by the
testator as by the Japse of time.
We do not, however, under any circumstances, suffer the will of a deceased
person to become void through the mere fact that the period of ten years from
the time of its execution has expired, and all former constitutions promulgated
with reference to the annulment of wills of this kind are hereby entirely
repealed.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof April, during the
fifth Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 530.

28. The Same Emperor to Julian, Prsetorian Prefect.
The ancient law required wills to be continuously executed, and, as its meaning
was not properly interpreted, this has resulted in the injury of both witnesses
and wills, hence We order that, during the time in which a will is drawn up, or
a codicil executed, or any other final disposition of property made, it shall
be done in accordance with the ancient custom (for We do not think that on this
account any change should be made) and that their execution should not be
suspended for any reason which is not necessary, as no such important
transaction should be interrupted by matters which are of but trifling
consequence.
If, however, any exigency having reference to the corporeal suffering of the
testator should arise, that is to say, if the offering of necessary food or
drink, or the administration or application of medicinal remedies should be
required, which, if omitted, the health of the testator would be in danger, or
if any necessary call of nature should, in the case of either the testator or
the witnesses, compel interruption of the proceedings, the will shall not be
set aside for this reason, even though one of the witnesses may be attacked by
epilepsy, which We understand took place, but as soon as the cause which
produced a temporary delay has been removed, the customary formalities
accompanying the execution of a will shall be complied with.
But where anything is done by the testator while the witnesses have been
withdrawn for a short time, because he was ashamed to satisfy a demand of
nature in their presence, the witnesses having been again introduced, and the
execution of the will resumed, it shall proceed. If, however, one or more of
the witnesses should be compelled to withdraw for a reason of this kind,
provided that only a brief term of absence is required, We order that those
present shall await their return, and that the formalities shall again be
resumed. But when some contingency demands longer absence of the witness, and
the condition of the testator being dangerous, threatens to grow worse, then,
the said witness or witnesses in question being absent,
others shall be called in their stead, and shall be informed by the testator,
as well as by the other witnesses of everything that has taken place, before
they were summoned. This having been made clear in every respect, all that is
necessary must be done by them, along with the other witnesses, even if the
signatures of the latter have in the meantime already been attached to the
will, for in this manner We relieve nature, and permit the execution of the
last wills of deceased persons to remain in their former condition without the
risk of becoming void.

(1) As, however, it has been provided by another constitution, which was
promulgated with reference to the execution of wills, that the presence of as
many as seven witnesses should be required, and the signature of the testator
should be made by himself or by someone else for him; and as this constitution
set forth that if he could not write, an eighth witness might be called to sign
for him; and if he had written his will with his own hand, and afterwards the
witnesses who were called attached their signatures to the same, and all the
other formalities exacted in the execution of a will took place, and then a
doubt arose whether the will was void or not, We, for the purpose of amending
the said constitution, do hereby decree that if anyone should write an entire
will or codicil with his own hand, and expressly state therein that he had done
so, the writing of the entire will shall be deemed sufficient, and no other
signature either of the testator or of anyone else in his behalf shall be
required, but the signatures of the witnesses must be attached to the
instrument, and all other required formalities be observed, and the said will
or codicil shall be valid, if the signatures of five witnesses are affixed to
the document written by the testator; and its validity shall be permanent, and
no unscrupulous schemer shall hereafter call it in question on this account.
Given at Constantinople, on the sixth of the Kalendsof April, during the fifth
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 530.

29. The Same to John, Prs&torian Prefect.
We order that where a testator has sufficient strength to be able to write, he
shall insert the name or names of the heir or heirs, by the side of his
signature, or in some other part of his will, in order that it may be clear
that his estate has been transferred in accordance with his wishes. If,
however, through the severity of disease, or on account of his ignorance of
letters, he is unable to do this, the name or names of the heir or heirs must
be mentioned by him in the presence of the witnesses to the will, in order that
the latter may, by all means, know who have been appointed, and that the
succession may pass without question to those designated for that purpose.
But when the condition of the testator is such that he can neither write, nor
speak so as to be understood, he should be considered as dead, and any will
produced under these circumstances shall be regarded as spurious. We, desiring
that any person who produces such a document shall become an exile from our
Empire (especially where this is done in the execution of wills), do publish
this law as an Edict
throughout the entire world. If it should not be obeyed, and the name or names
of the heir or heirs should not be written by the testator, or mentioned in the
presence of witnesses, We will not suffer a will of this kind to stand either
as a whole, if all the names of the heirs were omitted, or so far as the
appointment of an heir, whose name was neither indicated by the voice or in the
handwriting of the testator, is concerned.
But, in order that the witnesses may not forget where the names of the heirs
have been mentioned, they must not delay to write them down by the side of
their own signatures (when the testator did not himself write them down or
mention them) to insure that what has been done may always be remembered.
If, however, the testator himself wrote the names of the heirs in any part of
the will (as has been already stated), it will be superfluous for the witnesses
afterwards to add the said names to their signatures, as perhaps the testator
might not wish for them to know who his heirs were, and also for the reason
that they are designated in the handwriting of the testator himself. It is by
all means necessary that the names of the heirs should be made known either by
the written statement or voice of the testator, or by the writing of the
witnesses who have been called together to attest the will. For just as in the
case of a nuncupative will it is necessary for the testator to pronounce the
name or names of his heir or heirs, so, in the execution of written wills, if
the testator himself is unwilling to write their names down with his own hand,
or is unable to do so, they must be designated by his voice.
We order that these provisions shall only be observed hereafter, and that any
wills executed shall, in the future, be attended with this formality, for how
could anyone commit an offence who, ignorant of the provisions of the present
law, did what was formerly required? Clerks and notaries, as well as others
employed in drawing up wills, shall not escape the penalty of forgery if they
venture to do otherwise, and act fraudulently in a transaction of such
importance.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof March, after the fifth Consulate of
Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
Extract from Novel 119, Chapter IX. Latin Text.
A will is valid at present if the preceding law is not complied with in this
respect, whether the name of the heir has been written by the hand of the
testator, or by anyone else.

30. The Same Emperor to John, Prs&tormn Prefect.
We now proceed to provide for other matters, and especially for the last wills
of deceased persons. Therefore, when We find that any controversy has arisen
among the ancient interpreters of jurisprudence, with reference to a will which
was lawfully executed, bearing the seals of seven witnesses, and which
afterwards, by some accident, or through the act of the testator himself, was
wholly erased, or the greater portion of it torn, and its meaning thereby
rendered doubtful,
for the purpose of remedying this, as is usually done, We order that if the
testator cuts the cord or removes the seals, the will shall be void, as
indicating that he has changed his mind. Where, however, this happens for any
other reason whatsoever, the will shall remain valid, and the heirs mentioned
therein shall by all means be called to the inheritance; as the Constitution
which We promulgated for the protection of wills provided that the testator
shall write the name of the heir with his own hand, or if, through his not
knowing how to write, or on account of his illness, or for any other reason, he
should not be able to do so, the witnesses, after having heard the name of the
heir mentioned by the testator, shall, in the presence of the latter, write the
name of the said heir by the side of their own signatures.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof November, after the
fifth Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.

31. The Same Emperor to John, Praetorian Prefect.
Rustic ignorance has always been provided for by the ancient laws, and by the
different Princes who have preceded Us, and the latter have dispensed with the
strict observance of many legal formalities, which we find in the documents
themselves relating to these matters. For, as the execution of wills has been
established under certain legal rules, how can persons who reside in the
country, and have no knowledge of letters, strictly comply with the prescribed
formalities in the execution of their last wills ? Therefore, considering- the
beneficence of God, We have deemed it necessary to come to the relief of their
ignorance by means of this law. Hence, We order that, in all the towns and
camps of the Roman Empire, where Our laws have been promulgated, and the
science of letters flourishes, all the provisions contained in the books of Our
Digest and Institutes, as well as in Our Imperial Decrees and regulations
providing for the execution of wills, shall be observed, and that no change
shall be made in them by the
present law.
In those places in which educated men are rarely found, We grant, by the
present enactment, that residents of the country shall observe their ancient
customs instead of the law, so that, wherever persons who know how to write can
be found, seven witnesses who are required for the attestation of a will shall
be called together, and each one shall affix his own signature thereto. Where,
however, educated persons cannot be found, seven witnesses shall be permitted
to attest the will without signing the same. But when seven witnesses cannot be
found in that neighborhood, We order that witnesses to at least the number of
five shall be called together, but We do not, under any circumstances, permit a
smaller number to be sufficient.
Where one, two, or more are educated, they are authorized to write the
signatures of the others in their presence, in order that the witnesses
themselves may be aware of the intention of the testator, and by all means may
know what heir or heirs he desires to appoint, and they must state this on oath
after the death of the testator. Therefore, every resident of the country (as
mentioned above) may make
this disposition of his estate, and the rigor of the law having been relaxed,
it shall remain incontrovertible and valid.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Nonesof July, during the Consulate
of Our Lord Justinian, Consul for the fourth time, and Paulinus, Consul for the
fifth time, 534.



TITLE XXIV.
CONCERNING THE APPOINTMENT OF HEIRS, AND WHAT PERSONS CANNOT BE APPOINTED
HEIRS.
1. The Emperor Titus JElius Antoninus to Anthestianus.
Persons who have been deported and afterwards appointed heirs are considered as
foreigners, and not entitled to take under the will; but the right of
inheritance remains in the same condition in which it would have been if no
heirs had been designated.
Without date or designation of consul.
2. The Emperor Antoninus to Cselitius.
If your father has been appointed heir to a residuary estate, which another
testamentary heir cannot take, the latter will not be entitled to any portion
of the estate on account of his condition, and your father will be the heir to
the whole of it, for the designation of the residuary estate is understood to
mean all of the same.
Given at Rome on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof July, under the Consulate of
the two Aspers, 213.
3. The Emperor Alexander to the Soldier Vital.
You state that the knight Alexander appointed by his will Julian, who was his
freedman, his heir in the first place, and made a substitution for him in the
following words: "If, for any reason, my first heir should decline to accept my
estate, or should be unable to do so, I then substitute Vital, my second heir,
in his stead."
After the death of the testator, it was ascertained that Julian was the common
slave of the deceased soldier and his brother Zoilus, and the question arises
whether you should be admitted to the substitution, for if a testator,
believing that Julian was his own private freedman, appointed him his heir, and
did not wish that the estate should belong to anyone else through him, the
condition of the substitution is fulfilled, and you are entitled to the estate.
But where the terms of the written substitution were referred by him to the
law, so that if he did not appoint another heir through Julian (for he could
refuse to accept the estate even if his master ordered him to do so) the
substitute would be called to the succession. If, however, he should obey his
master, and enter on the estate, there would be no ground for the substitution.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and .^Elianus, 224.
4. The Emperor Gordian to Ulpius.
If your father appointed as his heir one whom he falsely believed to be his
son, and it is shown that he would not have appointed him if he had known that
he was a stranger, and the latter is afterwards proved to be supposititious, it
is established by the decisions of the Divine Severus and Antoninus that he
should be deprived of the estate.
Given on the day before the Nonesof October, during the Consulate of Pius and
Pontianus, 239.
5. The Same Emperor to Cassianus.
Your wife is none the less considered to have been legally appointed your heir,
if she is mentioned in the will, not as your wife, but as a connection by
marriage.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of Gordian,
Consul for the second time, and Pompeianus, 242.
6. The Emperor Philip and the Csesar Philip to Antoninus.
If your wife appointed you her heir for the purpose of setting off a debt, not
only the strict construction of the law, but also the will of the deceased are
opposed to your claim demanding payment of the obligation, in addition to the
share of the estate which was bequeathed
to you.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate
of Prsesens and Albinus, 247.
7. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximmn to Zizo.
No one can adopt any person as a brother among foreigners. Therefore, as you
state that your father did this, his act is void, and that portion of the
estate which he against whom you have filed your petition holds under the title
of an adopted brother, the Governor of the province will take care shall be
restored to you.
Given on the third of the Nonesof December, during the Consulate of Diocletian,
Consul for the second time, and Aristobolus, 285.
8. The Same Emperors to Hadrian.
There is no doubt that a corporate body, if it does not enjoy any special
privilege, cannot acquire an estate.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of Diocletian,
Consul for the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third time, 290.
9. The Same Emperors and Ceesars to Julia.
It has been decided that when anyone dies he can appoint a stranger
his heir.
Given on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof November, during the
Consulate of the above-mentioned Emperors.
10. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Asclepiada.
The rule of law declares that persons who are not permitted to receive an
inheritance cannot acquire it either through themselves as appointed heirs, or
by means of their own slaves.
Given on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 293.
11. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Hierius, Praetorian Prefect.
Anyone can appoint a stranger his heir, even if he is entirely unknown to him.
Given at Constantinople, on the eleventh of the Kalendsof March, during the
Consulate of Felix and Taurus, 428.
12. The Emperor Leo to Erythrius, Prsetorian Prefect.
This Renowned City, or any other town, can obtain by inheritance a legacy, a
trust, a donation, a yearly supply of provisions, any buildings whatsoever, or
slaves.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Martian and
Zeno, 469.
13. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Prsetorian Prefect.
Whenever heirs are designated with reference to any specified property, or are
ordered to be content with their appointment as heirs to a certain portion of
an estate, it is settled that they are considered to occupy the place of
legatees, and We order that when any others, who are appointed heirs to a
certain share, or without the designation of a share, but, in accordance with
the tenor of the ancient laws, are mentioned as being entitled to a definite
number of twelfths of the estate, they can only employ all hereditary actions,
or be sued, where they have been appointed heirs to a specified part of the
inheritance, or without any share being designated, and that their right to
said actions shall not be affected by the testamentary appointment of heirs to
any certain portion of said estate.
Given at Constantinople, on the eighth of the Idesof April, during the
Consulate of the Illustrious Decius, 529.
14. The Same to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
The following case contained in the books of Ulpian, which he published on the
works of Masurius Sabinus, seems to Us to require to be more plainly stated. A
certain person when executing a will made an appointment as follows, "Let
Sempronius be the heir of Plotius." Some of the ancient authorities thought
that there was a mistake in the name, and that the appointment should be as
valid as if the testator had actually been named Plotius, and had mentioned
Sempronius as his heir. We, however, hold that this opinion is incorrect, for
no man can be found who is so ignorant, or rather such a fool, as not to know
his own name.
But if the testator himself was the heir of a certain Plotius, it is clear that
he appointed Sempronius his heir, so that, by means of the testator himself, he
might become the heir of Plotius. We arrive at this conclusion from
consideration of the ancient law which stated that the heir of the heir should
also inherit from the testator. If, how-
ever, nothing of this kind occurred, such an appointment is superfluous and
void, unless before Plotius was appointed his heir the testator had added, "Let
Sempronius be the heir of Plotius," for then it should be held that if Plotius
did not become his heir, Sempronius would be called by way of substitution to
the entire share of Plotius, so that Plotius, having been appointed heir as the
result of fhe words of the testator, Sempronius would become his substitute.
But if the testator himself was not the heir of Plotius, and had not previously
appointed Plotius his heir, and wished Sempronius to be the heir of Plotius, an
appointment of this kind is of no force or effect whatever, as it is not
probable that anyone would make a mistake in
his own name.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof August, after the fifth Consulate of
Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
TITLE XXV.
CONCERNING APPOINTMENTS, SUBSTITUTIONS, AND RESTITUTIONS MADE CONDITIONALLY.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Alexander.
As you allege that the maternal grandfather of your daughter appointed her his
heir, provided she married the son of Anthyllus, it is clear that she cannot
become his heir without complying with the condition, and that the son of
Anthyllus, by refusing to marry her, will prevent her from obtaining the
estate.
Given on the Kalends ofOctober, during the Consulate of Anulinus
and Fronto, 200.
2. The Emperor Antonimts to Cassia.
If you did not comply with the condition under which you were appointed the
heir of your mother, the substitution will take effect, for it cannot be held
that you were released under the pretext that the marriage would be
dishonorable because your mother desired you to be united in matrimony with the
son of her sister, who is your cousin, probably with the design of acquiring
his father's estate. You are not entitled to any extraordinary relief as is
stated in the prayer of your petition, for it was not his fault that the
condition imposed by the last will of your mother, the testatrix, was not
complied with.
Given at Rome, on the eighth of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of
Antoninus, Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
3. The Same Emperor to Maxentius and Others.
If your mother appointed your heirs under the condition of your emancipation,
and, before the will of the deceased was complied with, your father incurred
the sentence of deportation, or died, and you were freed from his control by
his death, or in any other way, you have in consequence acquired the right to
enter upon his estate.
Given on the day before the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Sabinus and
Anulinus, 217.
4. The Emperor Alexander to ^mylianus.
When a father appoints his son, who is subject to his authority, his heir,
under the condition that he shall be emancipated, and did not disinherit him,
in case he should fail to be emancipated, he is not considered to have died
testate.
As you allege that you had gone beyond seas, and to a far distant country, and
that you were appointed his heir under the condition that you should return to
your own country, which is in the province of Mauritania, and you do not state
that you would be disinherited if you did not return, it is evident that you
were not able to comply with the condition on account of the occurrence of many
events which were not under your control, but accidental, and therefore you are
not prohibited from entering upon the estate.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Julian,
Consul for the second time, and Crispinus, 225.
5. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus to Maxima.
You are more to blame than your mother, for if she wished you to be her heir,
she should not have ordered you to separate from your husband, a provision
which is of no effect; but you have, nevertheless, complied with the terms of
her will by obtaining a divorce. It would, however, have been better to have
preferred marital concord to gain, even if a condition of this kind was valid,
for as good morals forbid such conditions to be observed, you could have
retained your marriage without suffering any loss. Therefore, return to your
husband, being aware that, even if you do so, you can acquire your mother's
estate, as you will certainly be entitled to do, as you would have acquired it
even if you had not separated from him.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of
Valerian, Consul for the fourth time, and Gallienus, Consul for the third time,
258.
6. The Same Emperor to the Senate.
Generally speaking, We order that if a testator should make use of the
following words in his will, "If either my son or daughter dies intestate, or
without issue, or unmarried; and either one of them should have children, or
marry, or make a will," there will be no ground for either substitution or
restitution.
If, however, nothing of this kind took place, the condition will be valid, and
the estate shall be transferred in accordance with the terms of the will, and
the result of the uncertain succession of the deceased be finally determined by
either substitution or restitution.
But what course must be pursued if he did not make a will, and has descendants?
Would his children be entirely deprived of their father's estate, on account of
the perplexity attaching to expressions of this kind ? Therefore, with the
design of preventing such iniquitous provisions, and that no one else may
deviate from the proper path, We promulgate the following law, and declare that
it shall always remain valid, and be as advantageous to parents as to children,
and by
it we also protect the interests of other persons, even though they may be
strangers, with reference to whom anything of this kind has been inserted in
the will. We have found that the eminent Papinianus rendered a decision
characterized by the greatest wisdom in a case of this kind, in which a father
made a substitution for his children without providing for any issue which they
might have, which would be of no effect, if he who was injured by it became a
father and had children, understanding that it was not probable that if the
father had thought of grandchildren which he might have, he would have made
such a substitution.
We think that, on general principles of humanity, this interpretation ought to
be rendered broader and more explicit, so that if anyone should have any
natural children, and should leave them a share of his estate, or give them an
amount of property within the limits which We have prescribed, and subject them
to substitution without having mentioned any issue which they might have, the
substitution will be void, and the estate will go to the children who have been
excluded; and, in accordance with the excellent opinion referred to, those who
are called to the substitution shall not be entitled to the said share of the
estate, but it will pass to the sons or daughters, grandsons or granddaughters,
and great-grandsons or great-granddaughters of the deceased. The substitution
cannot take place unless the children themselves die without lawful issue, and
whatever has been decreed with reference to legitimate children shall also
extend to natural
ones.
We order that all these provisions shall also apply to legacies and
special trusts.
Given at Constantinople, on the eleventh of the Kalendsof August, during the
fifth Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
7. The Same to John, Prtetorian Prefect.
Where anyone appoints an heir under the following conditions, "Provided he
becomes Consul or Prsetor," or appoints his daughter his heir, "Provided she
marries," and if, during the lifetime of the testator, the son should be made
Consul or Prsetor, or the daughter should be married; or, while the testator is
still living, the son should retire from the consulship or praitorship, or the
daughter should separate from her husband, for the purpose of removing all
doubts entertained by the ancient jurists on this point, We order that whenever
the condition shall have been complied with, either while the testator was
living, at the time of his death, or subsequently, it shall be considered to
have been legally fulfilled.
We decree that this shall also apply to legacies, trusts, and grants of
freedom; lest if We countenance too much subtlety in the interpretation of
matters of this kind, the dispositions of testators may be fraudulently evaded.
Given at Constantinople, on the ninth of the Kalendsof August, after the fifth
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
8. The Same to John, Praetorian Prefect.
If the following clause is found in a will, namely, "Let him be my heir in
accordance with the conditions contained herein," and nothing is added, nor any
condition is inserted in the will, We order that the condition referred to
shall be considered void, and the appointment under the will be absolute. We
base our opinion upon that of Papinianus, who said: "Tracts of land left to the
State, which have their own boundaries, are none the less due under the terms
of the trust, because the testator promised that he would in another document
describe their boundaries, and the order of the games which he desired to be
celebrated every year, but having been afterwards prevented by death, failed to
do so."
Where, however, he inserted any conditions in his will, then the appointment
will be held to have been conditional from the beginning, and everything stated
in the will must be complied with, just as if the testator had made the said
appointments dependent upon the conditions.
Given at Constantinople, on the sixth of the Kalendsof August, after the fifth
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
9. The Same Emperor to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
When anyone whose wife is pregnant appoints her heir to a part of his estate,
and his unborn child heir to the remainder, and adds that if the posthumous
child should not be born, someone else shall be his heir, and the posthumous
child, having been born, dies before reaching the age of puberty, a doubt arose
as to what the law would be, and those learned men, Ulpianus and Papinianus,
held that the question of intention was involved; and Papinianus thought the
testator intended that if the posthumous child should be born, and die before
reaching the age of puberty, his mother would be entitled to the succession in
preference to the substitute, for if he left a part of his property to his
wife, there is still more reason to believe that he intended that the estate of
his deceased son should go to his mother.
Therefore, We, for the purpose of removing all ambiguity, have adopted the
conclusion of Papinianus, and order that where substitution has been made in a
case of this kind, and, after a posthumous child has been born, he dies before
the age of puberty, during the lifetime of his mother, it should be rejected;
for We only admit substitution where the posthumous child was not born, or
where, after his birth, his mother died before him.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Kalendsof August, after the fifth
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
TITLE XXVI. CONCERNING PUPILLARY AND OTHER SUBSTITUTIONS.
1. The Emperor Marcus JElius Antoninus to Secundus.
Where heirs have been appointed to unequal shares of an estate, and have been
reciprocally substituted for one another, and in the substitution mention is
not made of any other shares, it is certain that the testator did not, in
making the substitution, intend tacitly to insert any others than those which
are plainly stated in the appointment of his heirs.
Given during the Consulate of Clarus, Consul for the second time,
and Severus, 171.
2. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Frontinia.
There can be no doubt that you are entitled to the inheritance of your son, who
died intestate; for the substitution made by the will of his father cannot be
extended to the time of puberty, because your son and the other heirs were not
appointed under the same condition, and were reciprocally substituted, and
reason suggests that the Divine Marcus, Our Father, intended that the same rule
should be observed with reference to those who could only be substituted under
certain circumstances, as well as to a son who died before reaching puberty.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Chilo and
Libo, 205.
3. The Emperor Alexander to Achilla.
If, having been appointed the testamentary heir of your mother, you have failed
to claim the succession under the will, and intend to demand praetorian
possession of the estate ab intestato,there is no doubt that you have
established ground for the substitution. Hence, if the substitute has accepted
the estate, you can sue him in the actions which you were entitled to bring
against your mother, but you cannot claim the succession on the ground of
intestacy.
Given on the eleventh of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of
Maximus, Consul for the second time, and ^31ianus, 224.
4. The Same Emperor to Firmianus.
Although it may be held that a substitution for a child under puberty, who is
under the control of the testator, made by the father, as follows, "If he
should not be my heir," will include the case where the child dies before
reaching puberty, after becoming the heir (provided it is proved that he did
not become the heir contrary to the intention of the deceased), and as you
state that the substitution was in these words, "If my son Firmianus, and my
wife Elia, should not become my heirs (which God forbid), let Publius Firmianus
be my heir in their stead," it is clear that in this instance a substitution
was created by which Firmianus could be substituted for both the heirs
mentioned.
Given on the fourth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Fiscus,
Consul for the second time, and Dexter, 226.
5. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Hadrian.
Direct substitutions made in the case of children who have not reached the age
of puberty are usually annulled after the estate has been entered upon.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of Diocletian,
Consul for the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third time, 290.
6. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Quintianus.
When a will has been legally executed, and several heirs have been appointed
and reciprocally substituted, some of whom accept their shares of the estate,
and others do not, the shares of the latter are acquired by those who accept.
Without date or designation of consul.
7. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Felicianus.
When a will has been properly executed, and there are daughters under the age
of puberty subject to the control of their father, and the latter substituted
you, in case a daughter should die before reaching puberty; it is settled that
you will become the heir under the will, after the condition has been
fulfilled, and that you exclude the intestate succession.
Given on the Kalendsof January, under the Consulate of the abovementioned
Emperors.
8. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Patrona.
You should, in your petition, state more clearly whether your former husband,
who died in the army, and whom you allege appointed your common son his heir by
his will, and substituted for him another heir in the first instance, intended,
in the second, to substitute the latter for the son who was under his control
at the time he died, and whether he designed that the substitution should take
effect before he reached his fourteenth year, or after his death.1 For it is a
positive rule of law that where anyone, who is under the control of his father,
who is a soldier, and has a substitute only in the first instance, and becomes
the heir of his father, and then dies, his estate will certainly go to you.
1 Two of the three kinds of substitution known to the Roman law are here
referred to: the vulgaris,or common, which occurred when the testamentary heir
either died, became incapacitated, or rejected the estate; and the
pupillaris,or pupillary, which took effect when the child to whom the estate
was left did not survive its infancy, in which instance the substitution
absolutely excluded the heirs at law, which was the purpose for which it was
designed.
An essential requisite of pupillary substitution was that the father should die
testate, and his will be declared valid. In this manner paternal authority
continued to be exerted after death, as he practically disposed of the estates
of his children, and regulated their succession. The rule was applicable
whether the child had peculium,or merely an estate in expectancy, or both.
Pupillary substitution was only operative until the age of fourteen in the case
of males, and until twelve in that of females. If made for a longer term, the
appointment was only invalidated for the excess unauthorized by law, which was
simply left out of consideration altogether.ED.
If, however, the substitution found to have been made in the second instance is
either manifest or indefinite, but has no reference to any age, and the child
should die before reaching puberty, he will have as heirs those whom the father
appointed for him, and they can enter upon the estate. But if he should die
after reaching puberty, then you will obtain his estate, just as property which
belonged to the father at the time of his death can be claimed by you under the
terms
of a trust.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof April, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors, 293.
9. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Prsetorian Prefect.
On the ground of humanity, We permit all relatives in the ascending line, who
have sons, grandsons, great-grandchildren of either sex, but no other
descendants, whose said sons or daughters, grandsons or granddaughters, great-
grandsons or great-granddaughters are permanently deprived of intelligence, to
substitute others for them; or if two or more of the above-mentioned
descendants are weak-minded, their parents shall, after having left them their
legitimate shares of the estate, be authorized to make such substitutions for
them as they may desire, so that, as in the case of pupillary substitution, no
contest of their wills may be instituted; provided, however, that any of them
afterwards recover their senses, the substitution shall be abrogated.
Where, however, a daughter, or any other descendants of any such demented
person are sane, the testator or testatrix shall only be allowed to make
substitution in favor of one, or several, or all of said descendants, as the
case may be. When the testator or testatrix have other children who are of
sound mind, and those who are insane have no descendants, substitution must be
made for one, or several, or all of the latter, as aforesaid.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Idesof December, during the second
Consulate of Our Lord Justinian, 528.
10. The Same to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
Where anyone, having appointed his two sons, who are under the age of puberty,
his heirs, adds that if both of them should die before reaching that age, So-
and-So shall become his heir, a doubt arose among the ancient legal authorities
whether he intended the substitution to take effect if both his sons should die
under the age of puberty, or, if only one of them should die, whether the
substitute would immediately succeed to his share of the estate. It was held by
Sabinus that the substitution would only take effect if both of them should
die, and that the father had in mind that if one son should die, his brother
would succeed to his share. We think that the opinion of Sabinus is preferable,
and decree that the substitution shall not become operative unless both the
sons should die before attaining the age of puberty.
Given at Constantinople, on the sixth of the Kalendsof August, after the fifth
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
11. The Same to John, Praetorian Prefect.
Acertain man appointed two heirs, substituted them with another for his son who
was under the age of puberty, and made the following provision in his will:
"Let whoever shall become my heir be, with Titius, the heir of my son."
According to what we find in Ulpianus, the son having died before reaching
puberty, the question arose in what way the parties were called to the
substitution; whether the first two who were appointed by the father were
entitled to half his estate, and the third to the remaining half, or whether
each of the three could claim a third under the substitution.
Another doubt would arise if someone should appoint his heirs as follows: "Let
Titius, along with my children, and Sempronius, be my heirs." In the present
instance, as Ulpianus held, the question was whether it was the intention of
the testator that Titius should be entitled to half of the estate, with the
children, and Sempronius to the other half, or whether all of them would share
alike.
It seems to Us that, in the first instance, each of the three substitutes would
be entitled to a third of the estate, but in the second, as the father and the
son are understood to be practically but one person by nature, half of the
estate should be allotted to Titius and the children, and the other half to
Sempronius.
Given at Constantinople, on the sixth of the Kalendsof August, after the fifth
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.

THE CODE OF OUR LORD THE MOST HOLY EMPEROR JUSTINIAN.
SECOND EDITION. (Continued.)




BOOK VI.
(Continued.)


TITLE XXVII.
CONCERNING THE APPOINTMENT AND SUBSTITUTION OF SLAVES AS NECESSARY HEIRS.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Aufidius and Others.
If, notwithstanding you were slaves, you were appointed heirs under the
designation of freedmen, your appointment as such should be liberally
interpreted, just as if you had been liberated and appointed heirs at the same
time. This does not apply to a legacy.
Given on the seventh of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Priscus
and Apollinaris, 170.
2. The Emperor Pertinax to Lucretius.
A person who is not solvent can appoint a necessary heir, even if he defrauds
his creditors. If, however, you were given in pledge and still remain in the
same condition, you cannot become free and a necessary heir of your master, who
was a debtor, and insolvent.
Published on the eleventh of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Falco
and Clarus, 194.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Felix.
As your guardian married your female slave, and afterwards appointed her his
heir, he could not, by an act of this kind, deprive you of your title to her,
and you will be legally empowered to order her to enter upon the estate for the
purpose of acquiring it.
Given on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors, 193.
4. The Emperor Justinian to Julian, Prsetorian Prefect.
A certain man appointed his son, who had not yet reached the age of puberty,
his heir, and in positive terms bequeathed his slave his freedom. He then, by a
pupillary substitution, substituted the said slave for his son, in the second
degree, without granting him his freedom, and the question arose among persons
learned in the law
whether, by a substitution of this kind, the slave would become the necessary
heir of the minor. The reason for this dispute arose from the ancient rule, by
which it was universally held that such a slave becomes the necessary heir of
his master, when the estate and his liberty are left to him at the same time.
In the present instance, however, the grant of freedom and the substitution are
not combined in the same act, but take place at different dates. Hence, for the
purpose of deciding this controversy, it appeared to Us extraordinary for
anyone to think that the intention of the testator should be thwarted by a
subtle distinction of this kind, especially where the testator is a master, and
to think that the slave does not become his necessary heir, but that he gave
him the right to obtain his freedom and reject the estate, and in this way
oppose his will. Anyone who attempts to do this should be punished. Therefore
the slave should become free during the lifetime of the minor, because this was
the intention of the testator, and if the minor should die, the slave will
become his necessary heir, because the testator desired that this should be the
case.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof December, during the
fifth Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
5. The Same to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
When anyone makes a will and appoints two heirs, one of them to a certain
portion of his estate, and makes a slave (mentioning him by name) heir to the
remaining portion without giving him his freedom, and afterwards leaves said
slave to another person, or, after the appointment of the slave as his heir,
bequeaths him by a legacy, and then appoints him his heir without giving him
his freedom, a doubt arose whether a legacy or an appointment of this kind
could have any force in law, and as to who would be entitled to the legacy or
the appointment. There was some ground for doubt, because he appointed the
slave, who still belonged to'him, his heir without his freedom, and such a
dispute arose among the ancient authorities that it seemed scarcely possible to
settle it. Leaving aside this ancient controversy, We have discovered another
way of disposing of the matter, as We always follow the indications of the
intention of the testator. Therefore, as We find it has been established by Our
law that if anyone should appoint his slave guardian of his children, without
bestowing upon him his freedom, by the mere appointment of guardianship he is
presumed to have been granted his freedom on account of his wards, for which
reason We have considered that it is only for the benefit of the estate, as
well as more humane and in favor of liberty, that if anyone should appoint his
slave his heir without his freedom, he, through that very fact, becomes a Roman
citizen. Relying upon this conclusion, We hold that the slave cannot be
acquired, and that the protracted and inexplicable discussions of the ancients
are not applicable. For it should not be presumed that persons are so destitute
of understanding as to appoint their own slaves as heirs without granting them
their freedom, and afterwards by a legacy bequeath the same slaves to others.
(1) But the ancient authorities raised .another doubt, by stating that if
anyone should appoint his slave his heir to a part of his estate by his will,
without granting him his freedom, and then should grant him his freedom by a
codicil, whether such an appointment would be valid, and whether he would
become the heir as well as be free, lest it might appear that the estate was
granted by the codicil, as an estate could not under the ancient rules be left
in this way.
We, however, being inclined to a liberal and beneficent interpretation in a
disposition of this kind, even though it may have been inserted in a codicil,
order that freedom and the estate shall be granted at the same time to slaves,
in order to render them grateful to Us that they do not remain in servitude,
but become free, and heirs. Our benevolence is exerted in their behalf to such
an extent that, although their freedom may not have been granted to them either
by a will or a codicil, nevertheless, when an estate is left to slaves it
should be considered that they have obtained their liberty.
(2) It should, however, be observed that when a legacy or a trust is bequeathed
to slaves without their freedom, they will remain in servitude; but it is to be
hoped that heirs do not exist who are so wicked as to thwart the liberality of
the testator, and fraudulently deprive the slaves of the remuneration to which
they are entitled, and that they will not be ignored, even though the bequest
was made to them while still in servitude.
(3) This legal regulation of Ours is also extended to another ambiguous case;
for if anyone should, by the principal part of his will, bequeath a slave to
another person, and then by pupillary substitution substitute the said slave
for his son without granting him his liberty, the question arose whether a
substitution of this kind would be valid, and if it would be acquired by the
legatee through the slave who was bequeathed after the death of the minor; or
whether such a substitution would be void because it was made with reference to
the slave without bestowing his freedom upon him.
The better opinion seems to Us to be to hold that the title to him was not
immediately acquired by the legatee, but that the substitution remains in
suspense, and if the minor should die, there will be ground for the
substitution, and the slave will at once become free and the heir. If, however,
there should be no ground for the substitution and the minor should reach the
age of puberty, then the title to the slave will pass to the legatee. For, just
as the ancient authorities, when substitution was made at the same time with
the grant of freedom, came to the conclusion that the grant of freedom should
remain in abeyance, and the slave should be considered entitled to it under a
condition, so, by Our interpretation, where the grant of freedom does not
accompany the substitution, the slave becomes free and the heir of the minor.
Given at Constantinople, on the second of the Kalendsof May, after the fifth
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
6. The Same to John, Praetorian Prefect.
The decision which We have just rendered, declaring that a slave appointed heir
by his master without the grant of freedom must be
considered free, shall remain undisputed; and if anyone should absolutely
appoint his slave his heir, but grant him his liberty under a condition, and
the condition is such that it can be complied with by the slave, and he should
be guilty of negligence and fail to fulfill it, he, through his own fault,
shall forfeit both his freedom and the estate.
Where, however, the condition was accidental, and fails on account of the
vicissitudes of fortune, then, on the ground of humanity, the slave will
undoubtedly be entitled to his freedom, but the estate, if it is solvent, shall
go to those legally entitled to it, if no substitute was appointed. But, if it
should not be solvent, and the slave should have been appointed a necessary
heir, he shall obtain both his liberty and the estate at the same time, for he
will then be free and a necessary heir, not only by the ruling of the ancient
authorities, but also in accordance with Our decision.
Given at Constantinople, on the second of the Kalendsof August, after the fifth
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
TITLE XXVIII. CONCERNING PASSING OVER AND DISINHERITANCE.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Favianus.
As a disinheritance clause should be inserted in the will after all the
appointments of heirs, if the testator should add that his son is disinherited
in all the degrees of succession, there is no doubt that the requirements of
the law will be satisfied. And, indeed, if he did not add this clause, it would
still be apparent that this was his intention, if he mentioned the
disinheritance in general terms, and the testament will be considered to have
been legally executed. Therefore, if the head of a family should disinherit his
son after having appointed his sons his heirs, and substituted them for one
another, he must be under-  stood to have made the disinheritance with
reference to both degrees; for the same heirs having been appointed, no good
reason can be advanced why the testator should have intended to apply the
disinheritance only to the last case.
Published on the sixth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Chilo and
Libo, 205.
2. The Emperor Alexander to Heraclida.
If your grandfather appointed your father and your step-mother heirs to equal
portions of his estate but did not disinherit you by name, although you were
under your father's control at the time, and your father died during the
lifetime of your grandfather, you will have a right to succeed to your father,
notwithstanding the provisions of the Velleian Law, for you have broken the
will of your grandfather and his entire estate will belong to you.
Published on the sixth of the Idesof April, during the Consulate of Fuscus,
Consul for the second time, and Dexter, 226.
3. The Emperor Justinian to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
Where anyone disinherits his own son, as follows, "Let So-and-So, my son, have
no share of my estate," a son under the construction of a clause of this kind
is understood not to have been passed over, but to have been disinherited. For
where the intention of the testator is perfectly clear, the interpretation of
the words is never important enough to prevail over it.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof March, after the fifth Consulate of
Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
4. The Same Emperor to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
By the present law, We correct the greatest defect to be found in the legal
enactments of the ancients, which held that different rules should be observed
in the testamentary disposition of the estates of parents, so far as males and
females were concerned, while both sexes enjoyed the same rights under an
intestate succession. They decided that a son should be disinherited by a
certain form of words, and a daughter by another, and in some instances they
introduced the Civil, and in others the praetorian law, in the case of
grandchildren.
Where a son was passed over, he either annulled the will under the law, or he
obtained praetorian possession of the entire estate contrary to the
testamentary provisions. A daughter, however, who was passed over, was entitled
to the right of accrual by the ancient law, so that at the same moment that the
will of her father was set aside with reference to a certain portion of the
estate, the right of accrual vested, and she herself was considered as included
among the legatees; and, moreover, under prsetorian law she was entitled to
complete possession of the property of the estate contrary to the terms of the
will.
A constitution of the Great Antoninus provided that under praetorian law she
could only take what she was entitled to by the right of accrual. Jurists who
established such distinctions as those above mentioned appear as accusers of
Nature for not having solely produced males, so that those from whom they
spring should not have been created.
In order to remedy this, We follow in the path of our ancestors, who clearly
appear to have entertained the same idea, for We know that in former times it
was permitted to include both sons and daughters, and all others, among those
disinherited in general terms.
The centumvirs afterwards made another distinction, and from their injustice a
second defect arose which has been brought to Our knowledge through the works
of Ulpianus, which he composed on the Edict of the Praetor, and those of
Tribonian, Our most illustrious Quaestor, and other eminent jurisconsults. The
last resort of children who have been passed over is the complaint of
inofficiousness in a will, and as a daughter could not have recourse to it, if
she were passed over, her position was worse than if she had been disinherited.
For since a daughter who was passed over would receive half of the estate
either through prsetorian possession contrary to the provisions of the will, or
by the right of accrual, and she was compelled to contribute
to the payment of all legacies up to the amount of three-quarters of her share,
she would, in fact, only be entitled to a twelfth and a half of the estate. If,
however, she were disinherited, a fourth part of the entire estate must, by all
means, have been given to her; and hence she whom her father thought worthy of
being excluded from participation in his estate would receive more than a
daughter whom he silently passed over in the appointment of his heirs.
And if, in accordance with the terms of Our Constitution which We have
promulgated with reference to the supplementing of the fourth part, the
deficiency should have been made up, in like manner, the deficiency of the
disinherited daughter, so far as the fourth part of her share of the estate was
concerned, still existed, and thus the defect remained in existence and was not
corrected by Our Constitution. Therefore, We order, as in the succession of
parents which passes by intestacy, both males and females shall stand upon an
equal footing; that females shall be benefited by the terms of wills; that
specific disinheritances shall be stated in identical language; and that a
daughter shall have praetorian possession of an estate contrary to the
provisions of the will in the same manner as a son, who is his own master or
emancipated, is entitled to; so that, if passed over, she can cause the will to
be set aside by law in the same way as an emancipated son, or one who is
independent, whether he causes the will to be annulled by process of law, or
obtains praetorian possession of the estate in contravention of its terms. This
rule shall apply not only to daughters, but also to grandsons and
granddaughters, and We decree that it shall be observed with reference to other
descendants, provided they are derived from males.
But, for the reason that still another defect has arisen under the pretext of a
difference, and one set of rules is observed with reference to the
disinheritance of posthumous children, and another concerning those already
born, as it was necessary for a posthumous female child to be disinherited with
the others, and to be benefited by a legacy, but a daughter already born was
not entitled to the legacy, We have extended this principle to the utmost by
means of a very brief additional clause, directing that the same rule shall
apply to the disinheritance of posthumous children, either of the male or
female sex, which We have already established with reference to other sons and
daughters; that is to say, that they must be disinherited by name, so that, in
the case of posthumous children, they shall be specifically designated.
Given at Constantinople, during the Kalendsof September, after the fifth
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
Extract from Novel 113, Chapter HI. Latin Text.
A parent is not allowed to disinherit or pass over any of his children, unless
the child is proved to have been ungrateful, and the testator specifically
mentions the acts of ingratitude in his will. Fourteen kinds of ingratitude are
enumerated by a new constitution.
Extract from the Same Novel. Latin Text.
A will is void only with reference to the appointment of heirs, where
disinheritance or the passing over of other heirs is involved. The other
testamentary provisions remain unaltered.
TITLE XXIX.
CONCERNING THE APPOINTMENT, DISINHERITANCE, AND OMISSION OF POSTHUMOUS HEIRS IN
A WILL.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Brutatius.
If, after having made his will by which the testator omitted all mention of his
posthumous children, a son or daughter should be born to him, he is considered
to have died intestate, as the will is broken by the birth of a posthumous
child of either sex, who was not mentioned therein. It is a well-established
legal principle that nothing is due, or can be demanded under the terms of a
will which has been broken.
Given on the fourth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Antoninus,
Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Sotericus.
The will of a husband is not annulled by a miscarriage of his wife; but it is a
perfectly clear rule of law that, when a posthumous child has been passed over,
the will is broken and cannot be renewed, even if the child should die
immediately after birth.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
3. The Emperor Justinian to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
We now decide a matter which has been the subject of controversy among the
ancients. Therefore, while an unborn child, who was passed over in its father's
will, became the heir of its father when it came into the world, provided no
other child had preceded it, and by its birth broke the will; where a
posthumous child, having been born, died without uttering a cry, it was doubted
if such a child could break the will by its birth; and the minds of the ancient
authorities were at a loss to determine what opinion should be rendered with
reference to the will of the father.
The Sabinians held that if the child was born alive, and did not utter a cry it
broke the will; but it is evident that if it was born dumb it could not do so.
We also adopt this opinion, and order that when a child is born alive, even
though it should immediately die, or perish while in the hands of the midwife,
the testament will, nevertheless, be broken. It is, however, absolutely
necessary for it to come into the world alive, and not have the shape of a
monster, or be horribly deformed.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof December, during the
fifth Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
4. The Same Emperor to John, Prsstorian Prefect.
Where a man, when making his will, used the following language, "If a son or a
daughter should be born to me, within the term of ten months after my death, he
or she shall be my heir," or if he wrote as follows, "Let my son or my
daughter, who may be born within ten months after my death, be my heir," a
dispute arose among the ancient interpreters of the law whether the said
posthumous heir should be considered as not having been included in the will,
and to have broken it. Hence, as We have promulgated many laws for the purpose
of aiding the intention of testators, We, for the purpose of deciding this
question, now direct that a will shall not be considered as having been broken
by the use of either of these forms of expression; but if a son or a daughter
should be born within ten continuous months from the death of the testator, or
during his lifetime, his will shall remain unaltered, in order that he who did
not pass over his children in his will may not suffer the penalty for having
done so.
Given at Constantinople, on the twelfth of the Kalendsof December, during the
fifth Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
TITLE XXX.
CONCERNING THE RIGHT OF DELIBERATING,1 AND OP ENTERING UPON OR ACQUIRING AN
ESTATE.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Titia.
If, having been emancipated by your father, you did not take possession of his
estate after his death, you need be under no apprehensions that you will be
obliged to do so, because you manumitted some of his
1 From the right of deliberation as to the acceptance or rejection of an
estate, accorded to heirs, is probably derived the family council, which,
utterly inconsistent with the institution of the patria potestas,and invested
with a quasi judicial authority, was called to settle domestic differences; to
provide for the appointment and discharge of guardians; to sanction marriages
and arrange for dowries and ante-nuptial donations; to authorize the
encumbrance of property; and to perform many other acts having reference to the
welfare and protection of minors, and especially of orphans. This tribunal is
provided for by the codes of most European nations, and as well as by that of
Louisiana. It is ordinarily composed of relatives, connections, or friends of
the minor and a magistrate of the district, who convokes it, and presides.
Application for the organization of a family council may be made by anyone
related by either blood, marriage, or attachment to the minor whose interests
are involved. Those who are summoned to attend are liable to a fine if they
absent themselves; and in case of injury to the minor resulting from the malice
or negligence of the members, the latter will be responsible. (Code Civil de
France,Arts. 405, 409, Codigo Civil de Espana,Arts. 295-313, Codigo Civil
Portuguez,Arts. 220, 226, Codice Civile de Regna d'ltalia,Arts. 47, 235, 237,
255, 260, 327, 334, Burgerlich.es Gesetzbuch,Arts. 1858-1881.)
An assemblage of this kind is called a "family meeting" in Louisiana, and the
appointments are made by a judge, who designates a justice of the peace before
whom it shall be held. Those who participate, five in numberpreferably the
eldest of the next of kinare sworn to give their advice to the best of their
slaves without authority, and sold certain property and other slaves for the
purpose of paying the funeral expenses.
Published on the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Messala and Sabinus,
215.
2. The Emperor Alexander to the Soldier Florentinus.
As you state that you have paid a certain debt of your father's, there is no
doubt that you should be considered to have accepted his estate, so far as your
share of it is concerned.
Published on the sixth of the Idesof February, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and ^Elianus, 224.
3. The Emperor Gordian to the Soldier Florentinus.
If your brother, at the time of his death, was under the control of his father,
whether he was appointed heir to his entire estate, and would have been the
heir even if the will had not been opened, or whether he was the heir only to a
portion of the same, he will, none the less, become at once the proper heir of
his father; and therefore, for the reason that he died a few days after the
latter, you cannot succeed to the estate of your brother. If, however, he was
his own master, and died before entering upon the estate, you are the lawful
heir of your brother, whether you obtained possession of the estate within the
time prescribed by the Edict, or whether the property belonging to it is
unjustly retained by someone else, the Governor of the province will cause
restitution to be made to you.
Published on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of
Gordian, Consul for the second time, and Pompeianus, 242.
4. The Emperor Decius to Athenais.
It has frequently been stated in rescripts that where the son of a family has
obtained an inheritance, and his father has acted in behalf of the heir with
his consent, the legal formalities shall be considered to have been complied
with.
Published on the tenth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Decius
and Gratus, 251.
5. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus to Paulus.
A ward can acquire an estate through his guardian acting as heir, but the
consent of the latter will be necessary; for if the guardian should do anything
without his knowledge, he cannot acquire the estate for him.

Valerian, Consul for the fourth time, and Gallienus, Consul for the third time,

knowledge. The official before whom the meeting is held is required to draw up
a report of the proceedings, sign it, and cause those who attend also to attach
their "signatures. A copy is given to the latter, who must have it published.
(Civil Code of Louisiana, Arts. 305-311.)ED.
6. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Philip/pa.
If your grandmother appointed your father her heir to two-twelfths of her
estate, your father will become her heir solely by the disclosure of her
intention. Therefore, if she stated in her will that you were to receive the
said two-twelfths, you can obtain possession of the amount by applying to the
Governor of the province.
Published on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors, 290.
7. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Eusobinus.
As you allege that your sister died before she knew that any of the estate of
her brother had been left to her, it is perfectly clear and evident that the
estate of the deceased could not be transmitted to her heirs, before she
herself performed some act as heir, or obtained prse-torian possession of the
property.
Published during the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of the above-mentioned
Emperors.
8. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Claudius.
Although the proper heirs did not immediately busy themselves with the property
of the estate of their father, still, if they were ignorant that it was left to
them, they_cannot be excluded by prescription of long time from claiming it
according to law.
Ordered on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
the above-mentioned Emperors.
9. The Same Emperors and Caesars to Plato.
If, by the properly executed will of your former curator, or on the ground of
intestacy, you have obtained legal succession of his estate, in this instance
he who did not reject it will be permitted to enter upon the same. Therefore,
the Governor of the province, having been applied to, should interrogate those
who are the heirs, and have not yet bound themselves, as to whether they will
accept the estate, or not; and if they demand time for deliberation, he shall
grant it to them as he thinks best.
Ordered on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
10. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Sabina.
If, having passed the age of twenty-five years, you have interfered with the
property of your father's estate, the insolvency of your father will not excuse
you, nor will the violence of your brother who has appropriated your share, or
suppressed the will, release you from the demands of the creditors, who have a
right, under the Civil Law, to sue you for your hereditary share of the estate.
Ordered on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
11. The Same Emperors and Cxsars to Philumena.
Your father, under whose control you were, can not, against your consent,
accept an estate which has been legally left to you, nor can he confer freedom
upon the slaves belonging to the same by manumitting them.
Ordered on the sixth of the Idesof February, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
12. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Antony.
There is no doubt that a child, who has arrived at the age of puberty, by
accepting possession of the property of an estate after it has been left to
him, acts in the capacity of heir.
Ordered on the third of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
13. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Sclepolis.
It is an established rule of law that a proper heir can obtain the estate of
his father by rejecting prsetorian possession of the same.
Ordered at Nicomedia, on the third of the Idesof December, during the Consulate
of the Csesars.
14. The Same Emperors and C&sars to Flavia.
If your brother was the legal successor of your sister, under both the Civil
and praetorian law, even though it cannot be proved that he was in possession
of the property of the estate, he, nevertheless, becomes the heir, and can
institute proceedings against those who are in possession.
Ordered at Nicomedia, on the twelfth of the Kalendsof January, during the
Consulate of the Caesars.
15. The Emperor Constantius to Leontius, Count of the East.
There is no doubt that if a son should become his own master before he accepts
an estate by order of his father, he can voluntarily claim the estate for
himself.
Given on the seventh of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Limeneus
and Catulinus, 349.
16. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Annodius.
No one can be compelled, against his will, to purchase anything, to accept a
donation, or to enter upon an estate which is onerous.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of Olybrius
and Probinus, 295.
17. The Emperors Arcadius, Honorius, and Theodosius to Anthe-mius, Prsetorian
Prefect.
We decree by this law that the vain formality of declaring that an estate is

Given at Constantinople, on the fifth of the Kalendsof April, during the
Consulate of Honorius, Consul for the seventh time, and Theodosius, 307.
18. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to the Senate.
Where an estate is left to an infant, that is a child under the age of seven
years, who is still under the control of its grandfather or great-grandfather,
or where it becomes the heir at law of its mother or of anyone in the
descending line of the latter, or of any other person whomsoever, the relative
having charge of it shall be permitted to accept the estate, or praetorian
possession of the same, in the name of the said child.
(1) If the said relative should fail to do this, and the infant should die
under the above-mentioned age, the surviving relative can then obtain the
entire estate by paternal right, no matter by what succession it descended to
the said infant, just as if it had been acquired by the latter.
(2) Where, however, the relative is not living, and some other person has
become, or has been appointed guardian of the infant after the death of said
relative, the guardian can, while the child is still in the age of infancy,
accept the estate in its name, whether it became entitled to it during the
lifetime of its parents, or after his death; or he can demand prsetorian
possession of the property, and in this manner acquire the estate for the said
infant.
(3) But when there is no guardian, or if there is one and he should neglect to
do these things, and the child should die in infancy, all the estates to which
he had been entitled but had not accepted are understood to be in the same
condition as if they had never been transmitted to him, and then they will pass
to those persons who would have been called to the succession, if the infant
had not been entitled to the same. These rules which we have established with
reference to an infant under the control of its parents will also apply if the
said infant should, under any circumstances, be ascertained to be his own
master.
(4) If, however, the said minor has passed the age of seven years, and on
account of the death of his father was under the care of a guardian, and died
before reaching the age of puberty, We order that the regulations contained in
the ancient laws shall prevail; and there can be no doubt that the minor, after
having attained the age of seven years, can himself enter upon the estate and
demand prsetorian possession of the same with the consent of his relative if he
is still under his control, or by the authority of his guardian if he is
independent; or where he has no guardian, he can appear before the Praetor and
obtain this right in pursuance of his decree.
Given at Ravenna, on the sixth of the Idesof November, during the Consulate of
Theodosius, Consul for the twelfth time, and Valentinian, Consul for the second
time, 426.
19. The Emperor Justinian to Demosthenes, Prsetorian Prefect.
As We have found in the ancient laws, and especially in the Questions of Julius
Paulus, that sons under paternal control who die while deliberating whether
they will accept the estate of their father or not, can transmit the same to
their own posterity, together with other privileges to which persons of this
kind are entitled, We hereby declare
that this right of deliberation shall be granted to all their successors,
whether they are cognates or strangers. Therefore, We order that when anyone is
called to a succession either under a will, or as heir at law, he shall be
entitled to deliberate, and if he has not done so, and has not rejected the
estate, so that he appears to be deliberating on this account, and if he has
performed no act which may indicate his acceptance, or his conduct as an heir,
he can transmit this right of deliberation to his successors; provided,
however, that the said transmission shall be terminated within the period of
one year after the estate could have been entered upon. And, indeed, if anyone,
knowing that he is entitled to an estate either as heir at law, or under the
terms of the will, should, without having requested time for deliberation, die
within a year, this right shall descend to his heirs, if it is exercised within
the prescribed period. For if, after the will has been recorded, or after the
heir kn,ows that he has been called to the succession either on the ground of
intestacy or under the terms of the will, or under any other title, he should
allow the term of a year to elapse without doing anything to manifest his
intention of either accepting or rejecting the estate, he, together with his
successors, shall be deprived of this privilege.
If, however, he should die within a year, he undoubtedly will leave to his
successors the right to decide as to the acceptance of the estate during the
unexpired time. When this has elapsed, however, neither he nor his heirs will
have any claim to the possession of the estate.
Read in the New Consistory of the Palace of Justinian.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof November, during the fifth Consulate of
Decius.
20. The Same Emperor to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
Where a testator, having made a will, appointed an heir to certain shares of
his estate, and afterwards by the same will appointed the said person heir to
other shares of no matter what amount, and then, a third time, left him a
certain number of shares of the same estate; the heir, having accepted his
appointment to one or more of the shares, and having decided that one or more
of the others should be rejected by him, the question arose among the ancient
authorities whether he should be permitted to do this.
In like manner, when a testator appointed his son, who was under the age of
puberty, his heir to a portion of his estate, and a certain stranger to the
remaining portion, and made a pupillary substitution of the latter, and the
testator afterwards died, and the minor became the heir .of his father, and the
stranger entered upon the estate, and subsequently the minor died before
reaching the age of puberty, it was doubted whether the pupillary substitution
would take effect. The substitute being unwilling to accept the said share of
the estate, the question also arose whether the testamentary heir could reject
the pupillary substitution.
We think that both of these doubts should be removed by Us at the same time;
hence, in the case of the appointment of the heir, or in
that of pupillary substitution, in order that everything may be accepted or
rejected, We have decided that the necessity is imposed upon the heir who is
especially appointed to accept either one or both parts of the estate, and that
the pupillary substitution should also either be accepted or rejected.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Kalendsof May, after the fifth
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
21. The Same Emperor to John, Praetorian Prefect.Where a testator appointed as
his heir a person who had a contest in court with a third party with reference
to his status, and who claimed him as a slave, and he who alleged that he was
his master ordered him to accept the estate, in order that the acquisition of
the same might be obtained through his agency, and the latter refused to obey
him as his master, a doubt arose among the ancient authorities whether any
penalty should be inflicted for insolence of this kind. They held diiferent
opinions on this point, and We, desiring to dispose of this discord, direct
that the question should be decided in such a way that a nice distinction may
be established in the case. For if the appointment was made in the following
terms, "I appoint So-and-So, the slave of So-and-So, my heir," for the reason
that it is perfectly clear that the appointment was made with reference to the
master, it will, by all means, be necessary for the slave to be compelled by a
competent judge to enter upon the estate, and acquire it for his alleged
master; and if he should afterwards be declared to be free, he will not be
subjected to any injury on this account, but all loss or gain will be sustained
or enjoyed by the person who attempted to reduce him to servitude; and all
actions having reference to the estate, both for and against him, will be
refused, and his rights will not be prejudiced in any way for this reason.
If, however, he should be appointed heir as one who is free, without any
mention of a master or a slave being made in his appointment, then, under no
circumstances, can he be compelled to accept the estate, nor shall unrestricted
choice be denied him, but the disposition of the estate will depend upon his
condition, and will remain in abeyance till a decision is rendered, whether he
be plaintiff or defendant in the case; so if he should be decided to be a
slave, he will then acquire the estate for his master, but if he is found to be
free, he himself will obtain it if he should desire to do so.
Given at Constantinople, on the second of the Kalendsof May, after the fifth
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes.
22. The Same Emperor to the Senate.
We know that two constitutions have already been promulgated by Our authority,
one having reference to those who thought they should deliberate with reference
to the acceptance of estates which had been left to them, and the other
concerning the appearance of unexpected debts, and the uncertain result to
which heirs are subjected by the discovery of conflicting claims. We are not,
however, ignorant of the
existence of certain ancient constitutions which the Divine Gordian addressed
to Plato concerning soldiers who, through ignorance, entered upon an estate,
and which provides that they can only be sued for the amount of property which
belonged to the deceased, and that their own possessions cannot be interfered
with by the creditors of the latter. This provision of the above-mentioned
constitution has been adopted by Us, for the Imperial legislator was of the
opinion that soldiers should rather be versed in arms than learned in the law.
Therefore it appeared to Us to be beneficial to consolidate all these
provisions in the same enactment, and not only to relieve soldiers by a
privilege of this kind, but also to extend it to all other persons, as well
where an unforeseen indebtedness appears as where anyone finds an estate which
he had accepted to be onerous. Hence the privilege of deliberation would not be
sufficient, unless in the case of men who are timorous and apprehensive of
things which are unworthy of suspicion.
(1) Therefore, when an estate, either wholly or in part, vests in anyone,
either under the terms of a will or on the ground of intestacy, and the heir
prefers to accept it directly, and does so with a certain expectation of
acquiring it, or meddles with it in such a way that he cannot afterwards reject
it, in this instance, no inventory is required, as he is liable to all the
creditors just as if he had voluntarily assumed the financial responsibilities
of the estate. In like manner, if he thought that the estate should either be
rejected or repudiated by him without hesitation, and within the term of three
months after he knew that he was appointed heir, or called to the succession on
the ground of intestacy, he publicly renounces the estate, he will not be
obliged to make an inventory, or comply with any other formalities, and shall
be considered as having no interest in the said estate, whether it be an
onerous or a profitable one.
(2) Where, however, he is doubtful whether or not the estate of the deceased
should be accepted, and does not think it necessary for him to deliberate, but
enters upon it, or occupies himself with its management in any way, then an
inventory should be drawn up by him without fail, so that, within thirty days
after the will has been opened, or after he has been notified that this has
taken place, or he has learned that the estate has descended to him as heir at
law, he must begin the inventory of the property which the deceased possessed
at the time of his death. This inventory must, by all means, .be completed
within the other sixty days, in the presence of the notaries and other persons
who are necessary for its preparation. The heir will be required to sign it,
and state that it mentions the property belonging to the estate, and' that he
has not committed, and will not commit any fraudulent act with reference to
said property, which shall remain in his possession; or if he is ignorant of
letters, or is unable to write, he can summon a special notary for the sole
purpose of signing his name, and the venerated sign of the cross shall be
prefixed to his signature by the hand of the heir; and this shall be done in
the presence of witnesses who are acquainted with the latter, and who are
present by his order to witness the signature of the notary in his, behalf.
(3) If, however, the heir should happen to be absent from the place where the
property of the estate or the greater part of the same is situated, then We
grant the period of one year dating from the death of the testator for the
completion of the above-mentioned inventory ; for the time aforesaid will be
sufficient, even though the property may be situated at a great distance. We
concede to persons the power of drawing up an inventory either themselves or by
attorneys instructed by them to do so, and who are sent to the places where the
property is situated.
(4) Where the inventory has been drawn up in accordance with what has been
previously stated, the heirs shall be entitled to the estate without running
any risk, and can avail themselves of the benefit of the Falcidian Law against
the legatees, so that they will only be liable to the heirs of the estate to
the amount of the value of the property which may come into their hands, and
they must satisfy those creditors who first appear; and, if after this is done,
nothing remains, any creditors who afterwards appear shall be dismissed, and
the heirs shall lose absolutely nothing of their own property, lest when they
expect to make a profit they may suffer loss. If, however, in the meantime, the
legatees appear, they must satisfy them either out of the actual property of
the deceased, or out of its proceeds when sold.
(5) But when creditors, who have not yet been paid, appear after the estate has
been exhausted, they shall not be allowed to annoy the heir himself, nor those
who have purchased property from him, the proceeds of which have been used for
the payment of legacies or trusts, or for the satisfaction of other creditors.
Creditors shall not be refused the right to appear against legatees, either in
the hypothecary action, or in that to collect money which was not due, and to
recover what they have received, as it would be perfectly absurd for laws
enacted to benefit legatees to deny to creditors their right to obtain legal
relief, as well as for legatees who are seeking for gain to be given their
bequests in full.
(6) When, however, the heirs have surrendered the property of the estate to the
creditors of the same, in satisfaction of debts, or have done so by the payment
of money, the other creditors who have prior liens secured by hypothecation can
appear against them, and recover the property from the subsequent creditors in
accordance with the laws, either by an hypothecary action, or by a personal one
for recovery, unless they voluntarily offer to discharge the indebtedness.
(7) As has frequently been stated, no action shall be granted against the heir
himself, who has exhausted all the property belonging to the estate.
(8) They shall not, however, be permitted to proceed against the purchasers of
property belonging to the estate which the heir himself sold for the payment of
debts or legacies, as We have sufficiently provided for prior creditors by
allowing them to proceed against subsequent ones, or against legatees who have
been paid, and in this way to assert their rights.
(9) In estimating the amount of the estate, We grant the heir permission to
accept and retain anything disbursed in funeral ex-
penses, or for the registry of the will, or for drawing up the inventory, or
for any other necessary matters connected with the estate, which he can prove
that he has paid. If, however, he himself had any rights of action against the
deceased, these shall not be merged, and he shall share equally with the other
creditors in every respect, but the right of priority shall be enjoyed by the
latter.
(10) Permission should be given to creditors, legatees, and beneficiaries of
trusts, if they think that the amount of the estate left by the deceased was
larger than that stated by the heir in the inventory, to prove the excess by
any lawful means which they may adopt, either by torturing the slaves of the
estate, in accordance with the former law promulgated by Us, which treats of
putting slaves to the question or by the oath of the heir, if other evidence
should be lacking; and the truth must be ascertained whenever this can be done,
in order that the heir may not obtain profit, or suffer loss through acceptance
of an estate of this kind.
It must, however, be observed that if the heirs should abstract or conceal
property belonging to the estate, or should take measures to remove anything,
they shall restore double the amount, after they have been convicted, or shall
be compelled to account for the same to the estate.
(11) While the inventory is in course of preparation, and is completed within
three months when the assets are at hand, or within three years when they are
elsewhere, in accordance with the former provision, neither creditors, legatees
nor beneficiaries of a trust shall be permitted to either molest the heirs or
bring them into court, or claim property belonging to the estate on the ground
of its having been hypothecated, but this term shall be legally granted to the
heirs for the purpose of deliberation, and during the interval no prejudice
shall be created by the hereditary heirs on the ground of prescription.
(12) Where, however, after the heirs have entered upon the estate, or if, being
either present or absent, they have occupied themselves with its management,
and have neglected to draw up an inventory, and the time prescribed by Us for
doing so has elapsed, then, for the very reason that they did not make an
inventory in accordance with the provisions of this constitution, they shall
undoubtedly be considered as heirs, and shall be liable for the entire amount
of the indebtedness due from the estate, nor shall they enjoy the advantages of
Our law, as they saw fit to treat it with contempt.
(13) We have established these regulations with reference to those who did not
deem it advisable to ask for time to deliberate, which We hold is entirely
superfluous, after the passage of this law, and should be refused. For as they
are permitted by the authority of the present law to enter upon the estate and
subsequently reject it, what ground remains for deliberation? But for the
reason that certain men, either through unfounded fear or sinister design,
think it necessary to petition Us to allow them to deliberate for the term of a
year for the purpose of examining the affairs of the estate, and perfecting
their insidious plots against it, and, by the employment of repeated
supplications and weak arguments they often request further delay, in order
that no one may think that We absolutely despise the customs of antiquity, We
allow them to ask time for deliberation, either from Us personally, or from Our
judges, but no more than a year shall be granted by the Emperor, and no more
than nine months by Our judges, so that they can obtain no further time through
the indulgence of Imperial generosity. If any longer period should be granted,
it shall be considered void; for We only concede one term for deliberation, and
no more.
(14) When, however, anyone has fulfilled all these requirements, and drawn up
the inventory (for it is necessary for the heir, while he is deliberating, to
make it out with the greatest exactness), he shall not be permitted to enjoy
the benefit of Our law after the prescribed time (that is, if he does not
reject the estate, but decides to accept it), but he shall be liable to all the
creditors for the full amount of their claims in accordance with the ancient
laws. As, however, two ways are open, one of them derived from former
enactments which allowed time for deliberation, the other more direct and
recent adopted by Us, by which heirs accepting an estate are protected against
loss, We give the heir his choice to make use of Our law and enjoy the benefit
of the same, or, if he thinks that the estate ought to be rejected, and that he
should have recourse to the aid of deliberation, he can do so; but if he does
not reject the estate within the prescribed time he will be liable for the
entire indebtedness due to the estate, and not merely to the amount of the
property constituting it, but if it is found to be too small to pay all the
claims, he shall, as heir, be bound for all the claims, and he can only blame
himself for having chosen the ancient burden, instead of the modern benefit.
Hence, We wish that to the grant of time for deliberation and the Imperial
Rescript promulgated with reference to the same, the following shall be added,
namely: that all persons shall be notified that, if after having requested time
for deliberation, they enter upon an estate, or perform any acts in the
capacity of heir, or do not reject the estate, they will be liable for the full
amount of the debts due to the same. When anyone rashly demands time for
deliberation, but neglects to draw up an inventory, and either enters upon the
estate or fails to reject it, he shall not only be liable to the creditors for
the entire amount of their claims, but shall also be excluded from the benefit
of the Falcidian Law. If, however, after having deliberated, he should reject
the estate without having made out the inventory, he shall then be compelled by
law to surrender the property of the estate to the creditors of the same, or
transfer to those entitled to the succession the property which he has
received, after having established the amount by his oath, which valuation must
also be verified by the judge. Our former constitutions, promulgated with
reference to these matters, have been repealed by a recent enactment which
provides for all contingencies. In one of these constitutions is contained the
confirmation of that of the Emperor Gordian, as this one has been found to be
better as well as more comprehensive than the other; and as the three
constitutions above mentioned have been consolidated into one, which
seems to apply to soldiers, as well as to all other persons, and because We do
not wish the subjects of Our Empire to be annoyed by the enforcement of the
former constitutions, We decree that soldiers who, on account of their
ignorance, may not have fully complied with the provisions of the present law,
shall only be liable for the amount of the assets of the estate.
We order that, in cases of this kind, this rule shall hereafter also apply to
senators.1
Given at Constantinople, on the fifth of the Kalendsof December, after the
fifth Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
1 The beneficium inventariiwas the privilege accorded to an heir by a law of
Justinian, to have a publicly and officially authenticated account of the
condition of the estate drawn up, showing a complete list of its assets and
liabilities; and by this means prevent him from becoming pecuniarily
responsible for the debts of an estate, which was either absolutely insolvent,
or encumbered to such an extent as to render its acceptance onerous and
inadvisable. In this manner, the limited representation of the deceased by his
successor was established, and the fatal effects of entering upon a damnosa
hiereditasavoided. Everyone who had any interest whatever in the estate was
notified to be present, a rule which applied to all the heirs of the deceased,
legatees, creditors, and claimants of every description. It was necessary for
the inventory to be drawn up under the direction of a certain member of
tabularii,officials who exercised the functions of both accountants and
notaries public, and had charge of the public registers. When neither the
parties in interest nor the tabulariiappeared, the signatures of three
competent witnesses were sufficient to render the inventory legal.
This proceeding was of great benefit to the heir, inasmuch as it exempted him
from any liability for the indebtedness of the estate over and above the value
of the assets. He could pay the legatees and creditors whenever they, presented
their claims. No action at law could be brought against him within the term
prescribed for the preparation of the inventory. Under these circumstances, the
time formerly allowed for deliberation as to whether the estate should be
accepted or not could be dispensed with. If, however, the heir failed to make
out the inventory, or decided to deliberate, he became personally responsible
for the entire indebtedness, even if the estate was not solvent, and even
forfeited his right to retain the fourth to which he would otherwise be
entitled under the Falcidian Law. The cost of the inventory was payable out of
the property of the estate.
Most of the nations of Continental Europe have adopted, with but slight
alterations, the beneficium inventariias authorized by Justinian.
In Spain, every heir has a right to have an inventory drawn up, even against
the express prohibition of the testator, and can avail himself of the same to
determine his acceptance or rejection of the estate. The proceeding may take
place before a notary or a competent judge.
"Todo heredero puede aceptar la herencia a beneficio de inventario, aunque el
testador se lo haya prohibido."
"Tambien podrd pedir la formation de inventario antes de aceeptar 6 repudiar la
herencia para deliberar sobre este punto." (Codigo Civil de Espana,Art. 1010.)
The heir is entitled to a hundred days for its preparation, thirty of which are
allowed from the date of the notification of creditors and legatees for its
commencement, and seventy for its completion afterwards. He is required to
state in court whether he will accept the estate, or not, thirty days after the
inventory has been finished.
"El inventario se principiard dentro de los treinta dias siguientes A la
citation de los acreedores y legatarios y concluird dentro de otros sesenta."
(Ibid.,Arts. 1017, 1019.) Priority is always given to creditors over legatees.
(Ibid.,Art. 1027.)
TITLE XXXI. CONCERNING THE REJECTION OR REFUSAL TO ACCEPT AN ESTATE.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Mutatius.
If it is established that you have declined to accept the estate of your
father, and it should be clearly proved that you did not reside in his house as
an heir, but as a tenant or a custodian, or in any other legal capacity, my
attorney will prevent you from being sued as the representative of your father.
Published on the Idesof July, during the Consulate of Messala and Sabinus, 215.
2. The Same Emperor to Severus.
If you declined to accept the estate of your father, you cannot legally be sued
by other subsequent creditors who lent money to your
French law provides for the demand for an inventory before the clerk of the
Court of the First Instance having jurisdiction, as well as its immediate
registry. The heir has three months in which to complete the inventory, and
forty days more to decide as to what course he will pursue with regard to the
estate. Where conflicting claims exist, their priority must be decided by the
court; when this is not the case, legatees as well as creditors are paid in the
order in which they present themselves. The heir is only liable for gross
negligence in the management of the estate.
"La, declaration d'un heritier qu'il entend ne prendre cette qualite que sous
benefice d'inventalre, doit etre faite au greffe du tribunal de premiere
instance 'dans I'arrondissement duquel la succession s'est ouverte; elle doit
etre inscrite su le registre destine a recevoir les actes de renonciation."
"L'heritier a trois mois pour faire inventaire, a compter du jour de
I'ouverture de la succession."
"II a de plus, pour deliberer sur son acceptation ou sur so, renonciation, un
delai de quarante jours."
"II n'est tenu que des fautes graves dans I'administration dont il est charge."
"S'il y a des creanciens opposants, I'heritier beneficiaire ne pent payer que
dans Vordre et de la maniere regies par le juge."
"S'il n'y a pas de creanciers opposants, il paye les creanciers et les
legataires a mesure qu-'ils se presentent." (Code Civil de France,Arts. 793,
795, 804, 808.)
The law of Belgium practically coincides with that of France. (Code Civil,Arts.
793, 795, 797, 802.)
In Italy, when there are several heirs, and one of them desires the benefit of
an inventory, but the others do not, the former alone can formulate the demand,
and the privilege will be granted. The heir who has charge of the estate is,
under all circumstances, obliged to account to the creditors and legatees for
his administration of the same.
"Se tra piu eredi taluno vuole accettare I'eredita con benefizio del
I'inventario ed altri senza, I'eredita deve essere accettata col detto
benefizio."
"In questo caso basta ehe un solo faccia la dichiarazione."
"L'erede con benefizio d'inventario ha I'obbligo di amministrare i beni
ereditari e di render conto della sua amministrazione ai creditori ed ai
legatari." (Codice Civile del Regna d'ltalia,Arts. 958, 969.)
Both the Austrian and Portuguese Codes recognize the beneficium inventoriiin
enactments resembling those of other European countries. (Allgemeines

father under the same obligations, on the ground that you purchased property
belonging to the estate from certain creditors of the same (provided you acted
in good faith).
Ordered on the fifth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Laetus,
Consul for the second time, and Cerealis, 216.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximum, and the Csesars, to Theodotianus.
Where a proper heir, by means of an exception based on an agreement, alleges
that a will is unjust, and afterwards claims nothing from his father's estate,
and does not appear in court on account of the donation, but for the purpose of
compromise, as he could not reject the estate after having once acquired it,
and as a compromise will be void by which nothing has been granted or retained,
or any promise given, he cannot be deprived of the inheritance.
Without date, during the Consulate of the Csesars.
4. The Same, and the C&sars, to the Soldier Modestinus.
Just as a person more than twenty-five years of age, having rejected an estate
to which he was entitled before having accepted it, cannot afterwards acquire
it, so he who rejects an estate which he has once acquired performs an act void
in law, but retains the right which he originally possessed; and because it has
been decided that a confession in court shall be considered as equivalent to a
decision, this does not apply to one who rejects an estate, but only to him who
acknowledges that he owes a certain amount of money.
Ordered on the fifth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
Emperors.
5. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Claudiana.
The rejection by wards of an estate to which they were entitled, without the
authority of their guardian, does not prejudice their rights in any way.
Ordered on the second of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
6. The Emperor Justinian to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
When anyone rejects the estate of his father, and afterwards desires to accept
it, he should unquestionably be permitted to do so, as long as the estate
remains in the same condition, and he should be allowed to claim it even after
a long time has elapsed.
We, desiring to correct this, do hereby order that if any of the property of
the estate has been sold, it cannot be entered upon, which was the rule in
ancient times. But where none of the property has been alienated, and the heir
is of age, and the entire time for demanding restitution has expired,
permission shall only be granted to him to do this within three years.
If, however, he is a minor, and has been appointed during the legal time, then,
after the period of four years has elapsed (which term was
prescribed instead of the available year conceded to those who enjoyed the
right of restitution), another term of three years shall be granted to the
heir, within which he can accept the estate, if the property belonging to it
remains in the same condition, and he can revoke his former rejection of the
same.
After this period has passed, however, no right whatever to enter upon the
estate of his father shall be granted him, unless, while he was still a minor,
property forming part of it was sold; for then he shall not be denied the right
to enter upon the estate, obtain complete restitution, recover the property,
and satisfy his father's creditors.
Given at Constantinople, on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof November, after the
fifth Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 532.

A competent judge will order the will which you allege has been executed to be
produced and publicly read.

Maximus, Consul for the second time, and Julianus, 224.
2. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus to Alexander.
As you state that the will made by your father was given to you in order that
it might be taken to his country, you can take it there and have it recorded in
compliance with the laws and customs of the place; but if the witnesses should
not be present, you must personally appear before the tribunal of the province,
or present a petition to the Governor, and with his consent have honorable men

Maximus, Consul for the second time, and Glabrio, 237.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Aristotele.
With reference to the new will executed by your father, concerning which you
took the oath of calumny, the Governor of the province will grant you the
privilege of examining and copying said will, with the exception of that part
which the deceased forbade to be opened, or which is alleged to disgrace
someone, and also omitting the date and the designation of the Consulate.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of the Caesars.
4. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Hes-perius, Prsetorian
Prefect.
Codicils, or any instruments in writing, no matter what may be their tenor,
which have reference to the final disposition of property,
must be produced in public with the same formalities with which wills
are published.

Consulate of Ausonius and Olybrius, 379.
TITLE XXXIII.
CONCERNING THE ANNULMENT OF THE EDICT OP THE DIVINE HADRIAN, AND IN WHAT WAY AN
APPOINTED HEIR MAY BE PLACED IN POSSESSION OF AN ESTATE.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Lucillus.
When a controversy arises between an appointed heir and his substitute, he who
was appointed in the first place shall be placed in possession of the estate.
Published on the twelfth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of
Dexter and Priscus, 197.
2. The Emperor Alexander to Eutactus.
Although the son of the deceased may allege that he has been passed over, or
the will is stated to be forged or inofficious, or have some other defect, or
the deceased is said to have been a slave, it is, nevertheless, customary for
the heir to be placed in possession.
Published on the sixth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of
Maximus, Consul for the second time, and ^lianus, 224.
3. The Emperor Justinian to Julian, Prsetorian Prefect.
As the Edict of the Divine Hadrian, which was promulgated concerning the
twentieth part of an estate, gave rise to many ambiguities, difficulties, and
complicated statements, because it prevented the twentieth part of the
inheritance from being exacted in Our Empire, and abolished all those
provisions which had been promulgated with reference to the fulfillment and
interpretation of the said edict, We hereby order that if anyone should be
appointed heir to the whole or a portion of an estate, and should produce in
the presence of a competent judge a will which had not been cancelled or
annulled, and was not defective in any respect, but appears in its original
form without alteration, and is fortified by the attestation of the legal
number of witnesses, he shall be placed in possession of the property which
belonged to the testator at the time of his death, and cannot lawfully be held
by anyone else, and which he received in the presence of public officials.
If, however, any contestant should appear, then the claim to possession and its
subsequent denial must be argued before a competent judge, and possession shall
be acquired by him who can show the best legal right to the estate, whether it
be the one who was first placed in possession, or he who, on the other hand,
has present control of the property. No delay shall ensue in placing the proper
person in possession; and, whether anyone obtained it too soon or too late, the
decision of thelaw must be adhered to, and the reason must be considered why
one of them was granted possession, and the other disputed his right.
When anyone has been placed in possession of an estate after the expiration of
a year, or even after a longer period (provided this was done in accordance
with the terms of a legally executed will), no objection on the ground of
prescription can be raised, unless a sufficient time has elapsed to afford
complete security of ownership to the possessor, or to exclude every claim of
him who was granted possession. For it is perfectly clear that if prescription
can be pleaded on either side, not only the act of placing the party in
possession, but also the principal cause of action will be disposed of.
Given at Constantinople, on the twelfth of the Kalendsof April, after the fifth
Consulship of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
TITLE XXXIV.
WHERE ANYONE HAS FORBIDDEN OR COMPELLED ANOTHER TO MAKE A WILL.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Severa.
Where a testator did not make his will voluntarily, but was compelled to do so
by him who was appointed his heir, or was forced by some other person to
appoint heirs whom he did not wish to designate, a crime is added to the civil
cause of action.
Ordered on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Alexander, 223.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Nicogoras.
It is a well-known rule of law that those who are shown to have prevented the
execution of a will by placing obstacles in the way of the testator should be
deprived of the right of succession as being persons unworthy of it.
Published on the Kalendsof January, under the Consulate of Diocletian, Consul
for the second time, and Aristobulus, 285.
3. The Same Emperors and Csssars to Eutyches.
It is not a criminal act for a husband, by his representations, to induce his
wife to make her will in his favor.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
CaBsars.
TITLE XXXV.
CONCERNING THOSE WHO ARE DEPRIVED OF ESTATES AS
BEING UNWORTHY, AND ON THE SYLLANIAN DECREE OF
THE SENATE.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Celer.
It is established that heirs who have neglected to avenge the death of a
testator can be compelled to surrender all the property of the estate, for they
who knowingly have failed to perform the duty demanded by affection cannot be
considered to have been possessors in good faith before the controversy arose;
and they shall be required to pay interest on the price paid for property
belonging to the estate, which has been sold, or on money collected from
debtors after the contest for the estate has been begun in court.
There is no doubt that this will also apply to the crops acquired with the
land belonging to the estate, or which they have sold after they have been
gathered. The payment of six per cent interest will be
sufficient.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate
of Chilo and Libo, 205.
2. The Saane Emperors to Verus.
It is not necessary that any business which Polla, who had the free
administration of her father's estate, has finished, should be made the subject
of dispute for the reason that a minor has become her heir. But if you, in
behalf of the minor, intend to allege that the will under which Polla has
transacted the affairs of the estate is forged, you can bring suit, provided
you bear in mind that if you should not gain the case, you must make good the
share to which the minor is entitled under the will, and of which it will be
necessary to deprive the said minor in conformity to the requirements of the
law; and the Governor of the province will take cognizance of the false
accusation of which you have been guilty, even though you are considered to
have acted in the name of the minor when you attempted to have the acts
performed by a co-heir set aside.
Published on the seventh of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of
Antoninus, Consul for the third time, and Geta, 209.
3. The Emperor Alexander to Antiochianus,
If the following point can be raised against the children of her whom you
allege to be your cousin, namely, that the will of their father, who is said to
have been killed by his slaves, has been opened and read before the slaves were
put to the torture, according to the provisions of the Decree of the Senate,
the estate will be confiscated to the Treasury. Therefore the case should be
brought before My representative, because at that time the children were not
minors.
Published on the second of the Nonesof April, during the Consulate of
Alexander, 223.
4. The Same to Philomusus.
The testamentary disposition of an estate cannot be revoked, even in direct
terms, by a letter or a codicil. But even if the testatrix stated in her will
that one of her heirs was not worthy of her bounty, it is not reasonable that
his share should be transferred to another, but it ought to be confiscated to
the Treasury. The grants of freedom bestowed by the said letter can, however,
be demanded.
Published on the second of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of
Maximus, Consul for the second time, and Julianus, 224.
5. The Same to Tyrannus.
It is not necessary that unworthy heirs should be deprived of an estate under
the pretext that they did not comply with the provisions of the last will of
the deceased with reference to his burial.
Published on the seventh of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Julianus,
Consul for the second time, and Crispinus, 225.
6. The Same to Venustus and Clementimis.
It has been decided that heirs under the age of twenty-five years shall not be
charged with the offence of having left unavenged the death of a testator. As,
however, you allege that you have brought an accusation, and that some of the
guilty parties have been punished, you should be under no apprehension of
suffering the loss of your father's estate by confiscation to the Imperial
Treasury, even though he who is said to have ordered the murder to be committed
has appealed, for it is your filial duty to contest the appeal. If, however,
you should be of age at the time, you will not necessarily be required to
contest the appeal, as you can enter upon the estate.
Published on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of
Alexander, Consul for the third time, and Dio.
7. The Same to Vitalia.
If, therefore, revenge for the death of the testator has not been demanded, for
the reason that those who committed the murder could not be found, no objection
can be urged against the heirs on this account, as they are not to blame.
Published on the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Lupus and Maximus, 233.
8. The Emperor Gordian to Tatia.
The position of a person who has attacked a will as being forged, conducted the
case to a conclusion, and lost it, is different from that of one who, having
begun an accusation of this kind, has abandoned it; for the Treasury will
obtain the share of the former, but the latter, against whom a judgment was not
rendered, does not forfeit the right to claim his share of the estate.
Published on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of
Gordian and Aviola, 240.
9. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Cxsars, to Mlianus. 
As you allege that your brother was killed by poison, it is necessary for you
to avenge his death to prevent your being deprived of your right to his estate;
for although those who are heirs at law are not forbidden to enter on the
estates of persons who have lost their lives through treachery, still, if they
should not avenge their death, they cannot obtain their estates.
Published during the Consulate of Tyberianus and Dio, 291.
10. The Same Emperors and Cassars to Sylvana.It is not proper for a sister,
after having avenged the death of her brother as required by law, to deprive
his wife of an estate to which she has been legally appointed heir. In
accordance with this, if you are confident of your innocence, and are certain
that you can prove that your husband did not lose his life through any
malicious act of yours, and that you were not, for some other reason, unworthy
of the estate, you can rest secure against any false accusation.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of the Caesars.
11. The Emperor Justinian to John, Prsetorian Prefect.The Syllanian Decree of
the Senate is considered by Us not only to be meritorious, but also worthy of
confirmation, together with the Rescript of the Divine Marcus published with
reference to it, but since We find in it no mention of grants of freedom, and a
question arose among the ancient authorities concerning grants of freedom left
by the will of a murdered testator, it seems to us to be necessary to dispose
of this question. For those who have been given their liberty by a will of this
kind, and accept it, can acquire for themselves any advantage which they may
receive in the meantime, that is to say, during the delay resulting from taking
vengeance for the death of the deceased ; but if they fail to avenge it, they
risk the loss of this privilege, even though they may afterwards obtain their
freedom. But in order that, in the interval, the slaves may sustain no loss,
and especially if, being female slaves, they have brought forth children, and
where the estate was afterwards accepted, it seems to Us to be perfectly proper
to adopt the Rescript of the most wise Emperor Marcus relating to grants of
freedom, in order that this prince, who was well versed in philosophy, may not
appear to have sanctioned anything which was imperfect. As his Rescript also
extended to inheritances, legacies, and trusts, and especially to grants of
freedom with which philosophy is always concerned, to the end that any profits
which may accrue to the slaves in the interim may be restored to them after
they have been liberated, and any children born may be considered to be free as
well as freeborn, and that through no machinations whatever an impediment of
this kind may cause them any loss, so that their offspring may also be free if
in the meantime they should die, and have the right to succeed to them as
heirs.
We have deemed it reasonable to confirm in every respect the Constitution of
the Emperor Marcus, for We consider that no act has been performed when
something remains to be added, in order to render it complete.
Given at Constantinople, on the second of the Kalendsof May, after the fifth
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
12. The Same to John, Prietorian Prefect.
Adoubt which arose among the jurists of antiquity with reference to the
Syllanian Decree of the Senate has been submitted to Us; that is to say, that
slaves shall be subjected to the punishment of death when they lived under the
same roof as their master, and did not afford him aid when he was assassinated.
The ancients did not agree upon what was meant by the words "under the same
roof," whether this should be understood to signify in the same bedchamber, in
the same dining room, in the same gallery, or in the hall; adding that if the
master was killed on the highway, or in a field, those slaves should be
punished who were present and did not extend their aid to avert the danger, but
they made no distinction in the interpretation of the term "present."
Therefore We, desiring to deprive them of every opportunity to escape
punishment on account of their neglect of the safety of their master, do hereby
decree that all slaves, no matter where they may be, whether in the house, on
the highway, or wherever their cries can be heard, or an attack can be
perceived, who do not bring assistance, shall be subjected to the punishment
provided by the Decree of the Senate. They are required to go to the aid of
their master for the purpose of preventing him from being the victim' of
treachery whenever they see that he is in danger.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof November, after the
fifth Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 532.
TITLE XXXVI. CONCERNING CODICILS.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Mocimus and Others.
It is certain that when a will is broken by the birth of a posthumous child,
any codicils having reference to said will will not be valid. If, however, as
you allege, after the will was broken, the father of the minors published a
certain instrument by which he confirmed the preceding will, the Prsetor did
nothing contrary to law, when, following the provisions of this last expression
of the wishes of the deceased, he decided that a testamentary trust bequeathed
to the State should be carried out, just as if it had been left by a codicil.
Published on the third of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the third time, and Paternus, 234.
2. The Emperor Philip and the Csesar Philip to Asclepiodota.It is clear that an
estate cannot either be given or taken away by a codicil. In the execution of a
new disposition of property of this kind.
however, the laws do not render void wishes which are expressed as requests.
Therefore you entertain an erroneous opinion when you think that you have, to
no purpose, been asked by a codicil to be content with certain property, and to
give to others what has been bequeathed to you by will.
Published during the Idesof October, during the Consulate of Peregrinus and
J3milianus, 245.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Hyacinihus and Others.
As you state that the mother of your wards executed two codicils at different
times, which are distinct from one another so far as their provisions are
concerned, there is no doubt that what she inserted in the first codicil is
revoked by that in which she afterwards secretly manifested her intentions,
provided it differs from the first in its tenor and shows a contrary purpose.
Published on the 'sixth of the Idesof September, during the Consulate of
Diocletian, Consul for the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third
time, 290.
4. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Stratonicus.
Those persons to whom property was left under a request shall none the less be
entitled to the same, although your mother executed a codicil during your
absence, and died intestate.
Without date or designation of Consulate.
5. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Flavia.
It is a positive rule of law that an insane person cannot execute a codicil.
Therefore if a document is produced which purports to be a codicil made by your
father, in order to claim anything under it you must prove your allegation,
namely, your denial that your father was not of sound mind at the time that it
was executed.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 293.
6. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Demosthenes.
Whether the testator in general terms directed that his dispositions contained
in a recently executed codicil or those which he had made in a former one
should be observed, you will have no just cause for anxiety, as you can rely
upon the confirmation made by the last codicil.
Given at Nicomedia, on the third of the Idesof December, during the Consulate
of the Csesars, 294.
7. The Emperor Constantine to Maximus, Praetorian Prefect.
If codicils and wills have the same effect, why are different names given to
instruments which have equal force and power ?
The answer is, that authority is not given by law to appoint or substitute an
heir by means of a codicil.
Given on the third of the .... of June, during the Consulate of Pacatianus and
Hilarianus, 332.
8. The Emperor Theodosius to Asclepiodotus, Praetorian Prefect.
When anyone, for the purpose of obtaining an estate, institutes proceedings on
any ground whatsoever, under either a written or verbal will, and then claims
the estate under the terms of a trust, he should not be permitted to do so. For
We by no means grant permission to anyone to enter upon an estate merely
because he has changed his mind; and We order that if a testator, having made a
will, has stated that it shall also be valid as a codicil, anyone who claims
the estate can, in the beginning, have the power to choose which of these he
will consider it to be, knowing that, after having made his choice, he will be
excluded from adopting the other view; so that if he claims possession of the
real estate in accordance with the terms of the will, or only according to what
is stated in the codicil, as well as other things of this kind; or if he should
absolutely demand to be placed in possession of the estate as is customary, he
shall be deemed to have explicitly stated his intention under the provisions of
this law.
(1) In like manner, the following rule shall be observed, namely, that when a
testator began to make a will but was unable to finish it, he must be
considered to have died intestate, and the document shall not be interpreted as
a trust, or as his last wishes expressed by a codicil, unless he expressly
stated therein that it should have the same force as a codicil, and if he did
so, the heir shall have the right to decide whether or not to act under the
will; and if this be the case, he cannot change his mind and consider the
document a codicil.
(2) Where anyone who is descended from parents of both sexes, and from children
as far as the fourth degree of agnation, or belongs to the third degree of
cognation, becomes an heir under the provisions of either a written or a
nuncupative will, which the testator intended should be regarded either as a
testament or as a codicil, and, having brought suit for the estate under the
will of the deceased has lost his case; he shall be permitted to have recourse
to a trust in order to acquire it, if he does so voluntarily; for reason does
not permit him to lose that to which he is entitled under the will, and not
obtain the benefits under the same instrument when regarded as a codicil.
(3) In every expression of the last will of a deceased person, with the
exception of a testament, five witnesses who have been summoned, or are there
accidentally, should be present, whether the will of the deceased is expressed
in writing or not, and when it has been committed to writing they must affix
their signature to the instrument.
Given at Constantinople, on the tenth of the Kalendsof March, during the fifth
Consulate of Victor, 424.
TITLE XXXXXXVVIIII..CONCERNING LEGACIES.
1. The Emperor Antoninus Pius to the Freedmen of Sextilia.Although food and
clothing were bequeathed to you as long as you may reside with Claudius Justus,
I, nevertheless, interpret the inten-
tion of the testator to have been that these things should be furnished you
even after the death of Claudius Justus. Without date or designation of
Consulate.
2. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Sabinianus.
Even though the testamentary heir may have sold the estate, still, the legacies
and trusts can be collected from him, and the vendor can recover from the
purchaser, or his sureties, whatever he has obtained
in this way.

Consulate of Lateranus and Rufinus, 198.
3. The Same Emperors to Victorinus.
Anyone who, after having made a will, pledges or hypothecates the lands which
he devised, is not considered to have changed his mind with reference to the
legatees. Therefore it has been decided that if a personal action is brought,
the lien on the land must be released by the
heir.

of Gentianus and Bassus, 212.
4. The Emperor Antoninus to Sulpitius.
A legacy or a trust left to slaves by the will of their master without the
bequest of their freedom is not valid, nor can it be made so, even if, after
the death of the testator, they have obtained their freedom in
some other way.

Antoninus, Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 213.
5. The Same Emperor to Donatus.
There is no doubt that an action for the share to which he is entitled out of

should be refused a legatee.
Published on the fifth of the Idesof September, during the Consulate of
Antoninus, Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.

If the first legatee has received his bequest, the substitution for the same in
favor of Pontiana no longer exists.

7. The Same Emperor to Faustus.
If your father bequeathed in the first place the Fortidian Estate as a
preferred legacy to your brothers, and subsequently bequeathed it to you, the
title to said estate is acquired by you in common with
them.
(1) The mistake of a name made in writing does not affect the right of a legacy
bequeathed, provided there is no doubt with reference to the slaves or land
which constitute the legacy.

8. The Same Emperor to Demetrius.
The military oath by which Marcellus was, as you allege, bound, deprived him of
the administration of the guardianship of yourself, to which he was appointed
by the will of your father; but this circumstance does not prevent him from
obtaining the legacy bequeathed to him. For his claim could not legally be
rejected, since, even if he wished to administer the guardianship, he is
prohibited from doing so.

9. The Emperor Alexander to Antiochus.
If an accuser who, in order to defraud persons to whom property has been left
by a will, states that the said will is forged, is allowed to be heard, the
Governor of the province must order the legacies to be paid in accordance with
the rules of his court, provided a bond is furnished that if the estate is
evicted, it shall be restored to those entitled to it, although there is reason
that a bond should be furnished, even when the legacies are paid without any
controversy.

Maximus, Consul for the second time, and ^Elianus, 234.
10. The Same Emperor to Ingenua.
When anyone knowingly bequeaths property which belongs to another, whether it
be a legacy or has been left under a trust, it can be claimed by him who has a
right to it under either of these titles. If, however, when the testator
bequeathed it, he believed it to be his own, the bequest will not be valid
unless it was left to a near relative, to his wife, or to some other such
person; and this will be the case even if he was aware that the property did
not belong to him.

left to her by his will.
Published on the fifth of the Nonesof March, during the Consulate of Pompeianus
and Pelignus, 232.
12. The Emperor Gordian to Mutiamis.
As, by the opinion of that most learned legal authority, Papinianus, which you
inserted in your petition, it is stated that a preferred legacy can be claimed
without the acceptance of the remainder of the estate, you understand that your
interests have been protected in conformity with law. This is the text of his
opinion: "A mother devised land to
her daughter in the following terms," "Take it as a preferred legacy, in
addition to your share of the estate."
Even if the daughter should reject the estate of her mother, still, it is held
that she can legally claim the legacy.

15. The Same Emperors to Terentius and Others.
If the entire assets of the estate which your father left are exhausted by
debts due to the Treasury or to private individuals, no testamentary
disposition of said property made by him is valid. If, however, anything
remains after the debts have been satisfied, the law does not permit grants of
freedom to be interfered with, and legacies as well as trusts must be paid
after the Falcidian portion has been deducted.

18. The Same Emperors and Ciesars to Justinus.

in his own name.

19. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Nico.
Ahusband who has been appointed heir by the will of his wife cannot only
succeed to her estate where the marriage has lasted only two months, but even
where the time has been less, and the shortness of the time does not prevent
him from acquiring legacies, trusts, or donations under such a will.

Given on the seventh of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 293.
21. The Emperors Constantine, Constantly^, and Constans to the People.
No special form of words is required for the bequest of legacies, or the
creation of trusts, and it makes very little difference, at the present time,
what expressions one makes use of, or what terms of speech he employs to
indicate his will.
Given on the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of Con-stantius, Consul
for the second time, and Constans, 339.
22. The Emperor Jmtinian to Menna, Prsetorian Prefect.
We direct that legacies or trusts which are to be paid annually, and which the
testator intended not only to be given to a certain designated person, but to
his heirs, can be collected by all his heirs, as well as by the representatives
of the latter, in accordance with the will of the testator.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Idesof December, during the
Consulate of Our Lord the Emperor Justinian, Consul for the second time, 528.
23. The Same Emperor to Julian, Prsstorian Prefect.
A question arose among the ancient authorities as to the signification of
words: for instance, if anyone should devise the Cornelian Estate, or any other
in its entirety, and afterwards should leave half of the same land to someone
else, how much the first legatee would be entitled to, and what share the
second could obtain; and, as a similar doubt arose with reference to estates
and trusts, and as many computations were introduced which entailed innumerable
discussions, We decree that all such computations shall be rejected as being
superfluous, and contrary to the intentions of the testator. For it is clear
that as he who, in the first place, left an entire piece of property to anyone,
and afterwards bequeathed half of it to another, changed his mind, and intended
that the prior bequest could be diminished by one-half, since
he offered that amount to another, the present question is susceptible of a
very easy solution. Therefore, if anyone should, in the first place, leave a
tract of land or an estate in its entirety to one devisee, and afterwards half
of it to another, each of them will be entitled to half of what was bequeathed,
or of the whole estate; but where all of it was left in the first place, and
the third part of the same was bequeathed in the second, in accordance with the
aforesaid rule, eight-twelfths of the land or estate would belong to the first
legatee, and the remaining third, or four-twelfths of it, would be acquired by
the second.
This same rule shall apply to all kinds of property, whether it consists of
estates, legacies, or trusts, for the indications of the intention of the
testator cannot be ascertained otherwise than by this method.
(1) It appears to Us to be humane to settle another similar controversy which
arose in the interpretation of the ancient laws. This originated in the case
where a testator bequeathed the Cornelian Estate, or any other, or certain
property, to anyone, and afterwards bequeathed the same property once or more
frequently, as a legacy, or under a trust to the same person, and then left it
in similar terms by will to Sempronius; so that Titius was mentioned
frequently, but Sempronius only once, what conclusion should be arrived at? And
what would be the law if the property was left to them jointly or severally,
and if it consisted of a legacy or an estate?
We, therefore, for the purpose of deciding this ancient dispute, do hereby
order that if the estate or the tract of land, in the instances above cited,
was left either jointly, or to one person, or several times to the same
individual, the said estate, land, or other property shall be equally divided
among the legatees, and each one of them shall be entitled to half of the same;
unless the testator expressly stated and specified how many shares he wished
one of the parties to have, and how many the other was to receive, for We think
that the will of the testator, if it is legal, should prevail in every
instance.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof December, during the fifth Consulate of
Lampadius and Orestes, 530. 24. The Same to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
A certain man disinherited his son, who was under his control and had not yet
reached the age of puberty, and having appointed other heirs by his will, he
appointed a substitute for the said minor, and manifesting the greatest
affection for his said son (to whom, however, he left none of his estate) but,
after unjustly disinheriting him, appointed a substitute for him, and charged
the latter with a legacy for his benefit, the question arose whether a legacy
or atrust left or created under such circumstances would be valid. If the
father left a legacy to the said disinherited son, and substituted a stranger
for him, after having disinherited him, a dispute again arose whether he could
even leave a trust in the same manner. Hence, as the ancient authorities chose
to discuss this question in different ways, and as controversies of this
description seem to be superfluous, We order that no substitute appointed for a
disinherited minor shall, under such cir-
cumstances, be liable in any fiduciary capacity, not even if, by the terms of a
legacy or a trust, the testator intended to charge him with the delivery of the
same property which he had already left to the minor.
Given at Constantinople, on the second of the Kalendsof May, after the fifth
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes.
25. The Same to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
When a legatee or the beneficiary of a trust conceals a will, and it afterwards
comes to light, it was doubted whether he who concealed it could claim the
legacy left to him by said will. We think that he should, by all means, be
prevented from doing so, so that he who wished to defraud the heir of his
inheritance will not obtain any benefit from his deceit, but may be deprived of
his legacy, and be considered as not mentioned in the will. The legacy will
belong to the heir, and he who thought that he was injuring another shall
himself suffer a loss, just as where a legatee, to whom something was
bequeathed in consideration of his administering a guardianship does not do so,
is deprived of his legacy, which is assigned to the ward whom he refused to
assist.
Given at Constantinople, during the Kalendsof November, after the fifth
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
26. The Same to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
We purpose to amend the rule laid down by legislators declaring legacies or
temporary trusts void, by ordering that this description of legacies and trusts
shall be considered valid, and shall stand. For as it has already been decided
that temporary donations and contracts can be made, it follows that legacies
and trusts also, which are left for a stated period, can, in the same way,
become effective; and that after the expiration of the time, the right to said
legacies or trusts gihall be vested in the heir. The legatee or beneficiary of
the trust is required to furnish a bond to the heir, to deliver the property to
him not deteriorated through his fault, after the specified term has elapsed.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof November, after the
fifth Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 532.
TITLE XXXVIII. CONCERNING THE MEANING OF WORDS AND THINGS.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Antipatra.
It was decided by the ancient legislators that where land with its
appurtenances was devised, and there was merchantable wine or oil forming a
part of the crops of said land, as well as any other articles which happened to
be temporarily placed on said land for the purpose of preventing the
depredations of robbers, they did not constitute any portion of the bequest.
You should not, however, be ignorant that wine in storehouses, when left on the
land for the use of the mother of the family, is included in the devise.
Published on the sixth of the Idesof August, during the Consulate of Antoninus,
Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Rufinus.
Where land with all its appurtenances is bequeathed as a legacy, or left under
the terms of a trust, the overseer, the slaves, and everything which the head
of the household made use of, or with which the land was provided, and was not
left there temporarily, is held by law to have been bequeathed. Moreover, it is
a positive rule of law that everything employed for the gathering of the crops,
as well as for preserving them, and for collecting manure, or feeding cattle in
order to obtain the increase of the latter, or which can be used for
cultivation, is included in the legacy or trust.
Given on the Nonesof October, during the Consulate of the abovementioned
Emperors.
3. The Emperor Justinian to Julian, Prsetorian Prefect.
We order that what is known by the name of a bond, or asphaleia,shall not be
considered as a gift of the surety, unless this has been expressly stated in
either the Greek or the Latin language; for if it has not been generally
referred to as a security, or specifically mentioned as a bond, the
asphaleiashall not be understood to mean a security, but a mere promise.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof March, during the fifth Consulate of
Lampadius and Ojestes, 530.
4. The Same to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
When anyone appoints an heir, leaves a bequest, creates a trust, makes a grant
of freedom, or establishes a guardianship, in the following words: "Let either
So-and-So, or So-and-So be my heir," or "I give and bequeath to So-and-So," or
"I wish property to be given to So-and-So," or "I desire that So-and-So, or So-
and-So, shall become free, and act as guardian," or "I order this to be done,"
a doubt arose whether the appointment, the bequest, the trust, the grant of
freedom, or the appointment of a guardian made in this way was not void; and
whether the position of the party in possession was the better; or whether both
parties were called to enjoy or assume benefits or burdens of this kind, and
whether they should be admitted to any order, or whether both should be
admitted without distinction.
In the case of the appointment of heirs, some authorities thought that the
first one named should be considered as the designated heir, and the second as
the substitute; and others held that in the case of trusts, only the last one
mentioned would have the right to accept it, as availing himself of the final
intention of the testator.
Anyone who desires to succinctly dispose of the disputes of these jurisconsults
will have no insignificant number of volumes to examine, as there is a great
variety of opinions to be reconciled, for not only the legal authorities, but
also the Imperial Constitutions which the said authorities have cited, are
known to differ.
Therefore having rejected all this verbosity, it has seemed to Us preferable
that the conjunction "or" should be taken to mean "and," so that it may be
understood in a certain sense to be copulative, and hence admit the first
person mentioned without excluding the second ; just as, for the sake of
example, in the interdict Quod vi aut clam,the conjunction autis clearly used
in the sense of et;and, in all cases of this kind having reference to either
the appointment of heirs or of the beneficiaries of a trust, or to grants of
freedom, or to guardianships, it may be understood that both parties are
entitled to equal shares of the estate, and can, in like manner, receive
legacies, and that both will be entitled to their freedom, and that both can
discharge the duties of guardianship, so that no one will be prevented from
enjoying the liberality of the testator, and greater protection will be
afforded to wards, and when a doubt exists as to who are entitled to the
guardianship, the property of the wards may not, in the meantime, be lost.
We order that these rules shall be observed when the instrument in question has
reference to persons. Where, however, only one person is mentioned, but
property is left as follows, "I do give and bequeath such-or-such property to
So-and-So," or "I leave it to So-and-So in trust," then, in accordance with the
ancient regulations, and the provisions of antiquity, the laws remain
unimpaired, no change having been introduced in them by this Constitution.
We order that this rule shall also apply to contracts.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Kalendsof May, after the fifth
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes. 531.
5. The Same Emperor to John, Prsetorian Prefect.By way of answer to questions
submitted by the Bar of Illyria, We decree that the term "family" shall include
parents and children, as well as all relatives and property, and even freedmen
and patrons as well as slaves. When a testator leaves a trust to his "family,"
without specifying by any addition those who are entitled to it, this shall be
considered to mean not only his near relatives, but even in case there should
be none of these, his son-in-law and daughter-in-law; for it seems to Us to be
only equitable that they should be called to the trust, even where the marriage
has been dissolved by the death of either the son or the daughter. But, under
no circumstances, can a son-in-law or a daughter-in-law obtain the benefit of
such a trust while any children are living, as the latter undoubtedly will be
preferred to the former; and this of course takes place according to degree, so
that the freedmen may come last.
This rule shall be observed where anyone has left immovable property, or made
it the subject of a trust and forbidden its alienation, adding that if the
beneficiary should decline to accept it, the property shall belong to his
family. Again, in other cases, the term "family" must be understood to mean
property; for the reason that slaves and other effects forming part of an
estate are considered as classed under the same head.
Given at Constantinople, on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof November, after the
fifth Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes. 532.
TITLE XXXIX. WHERE PROPERTY LEFT BY WILL Is REJECTED.
1. The Emperor Severus and Antoninus to Januaria.
If you can prove that the estate has been transmitted to the substitute in
fraud of the legatees, an equitable action will lie in your favor against the
person who was an accomplice in the fraud. It is evident that if he, having
received a sum of money, failed to enter upon the estate, he can be compelled
to surrender the legacies and
the trusts.
Adopted on the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of Fuscus
and Dexter, 226.
2. The Emperor Philip and the Ciesar Philip to Victoria.
It has already been decided that when he who was appointed a testamentary heir
prefers to obtain the succession on the ground of intestacy, he can not refuse
to carry into effect the grants of freedom bestowed by the will. If, however,
he could not enter upon the estate by virtue of the will, or demand praetorian
possession of the same, the will of the deceased shall not be executed but
shall be revoked as void in law, and claims for the bequests cannot legally be
prosecuted. But where the will was legally drawn up, and the appointed heir
having declined to accept the estate, another obtains it as heir at law, it is
clear that neither the grants of freedom can be perfected, nor the legacies
paid under the testamentary provisions.
Published during the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of Philip and
Titian, 246.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Aper and Pia.
If Proculina by her will left property to your father whose heirs you are, and
the appointed heirs have acquired the estate either in accordance with the
testamentary provisions, or on the ground of intestacy, because of the non-
acceptance of the will, a competent judge, having been applied to, must order
what was bequeathed to your father to be given to you, to the extent authorized
by the Falcidian Law.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
TITLE XL.
CONCERNING WHAT Is REQUIRED OF WIDOWHOOD, AND THE ABROGATION OF THE LAW OF
JULIA MISCELLA.
1. The Emperor Gordian to Bonus.
When a legacy has been left to a woman under the condition that she shall not
marry again after the death of her husband, and, by doing
so, she fails to comply with the condition, the legacy can, for this reason,
under no circumstances, be claimed.
Published on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of
Gordian, Consul for the second time, and Pompeianus, 242.
2. The Emperor Justinian to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
For the purpose of disposing of the ambiguities arising from the general
interpretation of the Lex Julia Miscella,We do not permit the oath to be taken
hereafter in accordance with the aforesaid law, and We direct that the said
law, together with the Mucian Bond, shall be rescinded, and that women shall be
permitted to disregard the restriction imposed upon them by their husbands,
which enjoins widowhood, and that, not having taken the oath, they can marry
again for the purpose of having children, and that the penalty shall have no
effect whether they already have children or not, and that they shall be
entitled to what their husbands have left.
From all this it is perfectly clear that where they already have children, the
estate shall not belong to them, but they shall only be entitled to the
usufruct of the same; and that the title to the property shall vest in the
child of the first marriage, in accordance with what has been decided with
reference to second nuptials and the benefits accruing to women therefrom, in
order that perjury may not be committed through the requirements of the law.
For Nature has created women for the purpose of having children, and their
greatest desire is directed to this end, so why should We knowingly and
deliberately allow perjury to be committed?
Therefore, let this oath be disregarded, and the Lex Julia Miscella,together
with the Mucian Bond introduced for this purpose, be abolished, as We desire
Our Empire to be enlarged, and to be inhabited by a numerous population
legitimately begotten, rather than to be weakened by wicked perjury; for it
appears to Us to be extremely inhuman to open the way for the commission of
perjury by the enactment of laws which punish the offence.
Given at Constantinople, on the tenth of the Kalendsof March, after the fifth
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
Extract from Novel 22, Chapter XLIII. Latin Text.
Where anything has been left by one married person to another, or by anyone
else, on the condition that he or she will not contract a second marriage, it
cannot be claimed within a year, unless the person referred to is absolutely
incapable of marriage; but he or she will be entitled to it after the
expiration of a year, provided a bond is furnished to return the property with
its profits, in case the condition should be violated. A bond, executed under
oath with hypothecation, must be furnished where the property is immovable, and
in case of that which is movable (if the person is solvent) a bond alone shall
be required; otherwise, a surety must be furnished, if one can be
obtained. When a second marriage takes place, the property given can be
recovered, just as if it had never been left or donated.
3. The Same Emperor to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
The Lex Julia Miscella,which We have rescinded so far as women are concerned,
should unquestionably also be abolished with reference to men, in accordance
with the terms of the law which We have promulgated on this subject. But that
no doubts may arise in the minda of ignorant persons, We hereby expressly order
that the Lex Julia Miscella,and the Decree of the Senate enacted with reference
thereto, as well as the Mucian Bond which was introduced to regulate marriages
of this kind, shall cease to apply to males as well as females. But, for the
reason that we have found certain expressions in Ulpian's treatise on the
Sabinian Books that there are cases to which the Lex Miscellais not applicable,
in order that no one may think that where anything is left to women by a clause
like the following, namely, "If she should remain a widow," or "If at any time
she should become a widow," or "When she becomes a widow," or on the other
hand, with reference to husbands, "If he should lose his wife," or "When he
becomes a widower," We direct that they shall not be prevented from claiming or
taking possession of what was left to them in a legal manner. For the property
is considered to have been bequeathed in ^order that women may not remain in
widowhood, or men in celibacy, and that the Lex Julia Miscella,which has
already been rescinded, should be applicable before Ours. But if this should
take place first, those persons to whom the property was left will immediately
have the right to demand the same, because it is considered to have been
bequeathed subject to a condition; and this liberality should be enjoyed either
once, or every year, as a consolation for the sorrow of the bereaved person.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof November, after the fifth Consulship
of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
TITLE XLI.
CONCERNING PROPERTY MENTIONED IN OR LEFT BY A WILL OR A CODICIL, UNDER A
PENALTY.
1. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Praetorian Prefect.
We hereby abolish the superfluous observance of the ancient Iaw3 by which the
wills of testators are weakened and prevented from being carried into effect,
ordering that where anything has been given or taken away by the last will of
the testator, through the provision of a penalty, it shall be void; but a
testator shall be permitted to order money to be paid, or impose any other
pecuniary penalty upon whatever he wishes, in order to secure the execution of
his will, not only by depriving him of estates, legacies, trusts, or freedom,
but also by
directing that these shall be transferred to others by the person to whom they
were originally left; or that something shall be given by him to them, if the
heir, legatee, or former slave should fail to comply with the terms of the
will.
Where, however, any of them is ordered to do something prohibited by law or
reprehensible in other respects, or impossible, the will shall then stand
without anyone suffering loss, even if the order of the testator has not been
obeyed.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of Our
Lord Justinian, Consul for the second time, 528.
TITLE XXLLIIII..CONCERNING TRUSTS.
1. The Emperor Antoninus.
If you can prove that Demetrius required his mother, who was his heir, to
furnish you with provisions every month, and clothing every year, and she
obeyed the wishes of her son and furnished the articles mentioned for a long
time, that is to say, in a case of this kind for not less than three years, you
will be entitled to have them furnished in the future, even if this has not
been done without interruption in the past.
Published on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate
of the two Aspers, 213.
2. The Same Emperor to Eupatrius.
Where a trust has been left which is void, and the heirs, notwithstanding, in
compliance with the will of the deceased, transferred to your grandfather
certain lands under the terms of the trust, you will, to no purpose, raise any
question with his heirs with reference to the said property, as the wishes of
the testator appear to have been complied with, not only as set forth by the
terms of his will, but also in accordance with the consciences of those who
carried out the provisions of the trust.
Published on the sixth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Laetus,
Consul for the second time, and Cerealis, 216.
3. The Same to Rufinus.
If, as you allege, the little girl, Chrysis, was manumitted by the heirs in
compliance with the will of the deceased, and died intestate before the estate
was transferred to her, the succession will belong to those who manumitted her,
if they accept it; and the rights of action having been merged, they will be
released from the obligation of the trust.
Published on the fifth of the Idesof December, during the Consulate of Laetus,
Consul for the second time, and Cerealis, 216.
4. The Emperor Alexander to Victorinus.
The will of a father which forbids his children to sell lands outside of the
family, or to encumber them, is not considered to prevent a brother from
conveying them to his sister.
Published on the fifth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and .^Elianus, 224.
5. The Same Emperor to Regina.
If your brother, who afterwards became the heir of your father, having reached
the age of puberty died without leaving any children, his estate does not pass
to you as the result of pupillary substitution; but if it has been confirmed in
any part of the will under the form of a trust, you will not be prevented from
demanding the execution of the trust by the heirs.
Published on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of
Julianus, Consul for the second time, and Crispinus, 225.
6. The Same to Nilius.
The heir should see that the liens on lands which are encumbered and have been
devised or left under a trust are released, and, by all means, when the
testator was aware of their condition, or, knowing it, intended that a legacy
which was of no less value than the aforesaid lands should be left to you. If,
however, they have been sold by a creditor, the heir will be obliged to pay you
the price received, unless it can be shown by him that the intention of the
testator was otherwise.
Published on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of
Julianus, Consul for the second time, and Crispinus, 225.
7. The Same to Septimus.
The question of the intention of the deceased must be decided by the judge.
Published on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of
Fuscus, Consul for the second time, and Dexter, 226.
8. The Same to the Emperor Masculus.
Anyone who has obtained his freedom by virtue of a trust can legally demand any
legacies, or property left to him in trust by the deceased.
Published on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of
Fuscus, Consul for the second time, and Dexter, 226.
9. The Emperor Gordian to Paulina.
No one can be charged with a trust who has not received either a legacy, a
fiduciary bequest, an estate, or a donation mortis causa.
Published on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of
Pius and Pontianus, 239.
10. The Same Emperor to Firmus.
The expression, "I wish," even though it may be lacking, is, nevertheless,
understood to be added, when, by doing so, the meaning of the sentence will
become perfect.
Published on the third of the Idesof December, during the Consulate of Gordian
and Aviola, 240.
11. The Same Emperor to Papyrianus.
Whenever property left under a trust is sold by all the heirs who have the
right to demand the execution of the same, the property is alienated, or where
some of them have given their consent for others to sell it, the validity of
the contract can, under no circumstances, be attacked.
Published on the second of the Kalends ofJanuary, during the Consulate of
Gordian, Consul for the second time, and Pompeianus, 242.
12. The Emperor Philip, and the Caesar Philip, to Rufinus.
It is a well-established rule of law that, where a woman has been appointed
heir and requested by the will of the deceased to transfer his estate after his
death, she can, before he dies, comply with this request, that is to say,
transfer .the estate, if she wishes to do so, whether the lawful fourth of the
same is retained or not.
Published during the Idesof October, during the Consulate of Peregrinus and
^milianus, 245.
13. The Same Emperor and Csesar to Sempronius.
Whenever the heir appointed in the first place succeeds the testator, any
legacies or trusts with which the substitute was charged cannot legally be
claimed.
Published on the eighth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of
Prsesens and Albinus, 247.
14. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus to Falco.
If she whom your brother appointed his heir should die without having obtained
the estate, and her death occurred before she reached her twelfth year, and in
making his will, the testator requested substitutes to be appointed; nothing
will prevent the execution of the trust from being demanded by her heirs, or by
those who have possession of her estate on the ground of intestacy. For, in
this instance, the rule by which any testamentary dispositions are not valid if
the estate is not entered upon as provided, will apply, for while one which has
been left in direct terms can be entered upon, one of this kind is bequeathed
in such a way that it can be claimed by the heirs at law ab intestato.We have
stated this in a Rescript, relying upon your statement that the appointed heir
was not legally adopted.
The case would be otherwise if the heir, having actually become one of the
family, should die, and consequently her heirs would be compelled to execute
the trust.
Published on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of
Valerian, Consul for the third time, and Gallienus, Consul for the second time,
256.
15. The Same Emperors to Philocrates.
Although a certain man who simply appointed you and your brothers his heirs,
desired that you should enjoy the benefit of the estate by being emancipated
from your father's control, still, as by the last words of his will the
testator tried to render you independent, it is understood that your father
will be required to surrender the estate to you subject to a trust.
Published at Rome, on the sixth of the Idesof October, during the Consulate of
Maximus, Consul for the second time, and Glabrio, 257.
16. The Emperors Cams, Carinus, and Numerianus to Isidora.
We are aware that the learned legal authority, Papinianus, rendered an opinion
that legacies are embraced in a trust like the following: that is to say, where
an heir is requested, after his death, to transfer any of the estate which may
have come into his hands, for We note that a preferred legacy is also included
in the words of the testator. But as, in the case of trusts, the intention of
the deceased is much more worthy of consideration than the language which he
employs, if you have, in addition, any evidence which you can bring forward to
establish the truth, and show that the intention of your father was what you
allege it was, you will not be prevented from instituting proceedings before
the Governor of the province.
Published on the day before the Idesof September, during the Consulate of Carus
and Carinus, 283.
17. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Fortunatus.
If it can be shown that it was the intention of the testator (who was also your
creditor) to release you, in conformity to the law, from the debt which you
owed him, it is clear that, even before your release has been solemnly
acknowledged by his heir, an exception based on the will of the deceased will
lie in your favor against his successor.
Published on the twelfth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and Aquilinus, 286.
18. The Same Emperors to Apolaustus.
As the deceased requested that you should be excused from rendering an account,
it is a positive rule of law that what he desired should remain unaltered.
Published during the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Diocletian, Consul
for the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third time, 290.
19. The Same to Ampleatus.
It is a clear and manifest rule of law that, in the case of trusts, the last
will executed should prevail.
Published on the eighth of the Idesof September, during the same Consulate of
the above-mentioned Emperors, 290.
20. The Same Emperors to Julianus.
Trusts with which the guardians of minors are charged should be executed, just
as if the minors themselves have been required to do so.
Published on the third of the Nonesof December, during the same Consulate, 290.
21. The Same Emperors and Cassars to Tiberius.
If the time for the execution of a trust of which your father was the
beneficiary, and whom you say you have succeeded, has arrived, although it is
established that when it was created you were not yet born, you can, under the
said trust, as the heir of your father, sue the wife of your paternal uncle,
whom you allege was requested by your father, in case he should die without
children and you should become his heir, to surrender the property left by your
grandfather. But if your uncle's estate should be directly acquired by you,
there will be no necessity to make a claim under the trust, but the property
itself can be recovered from her.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof February, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors, 293.
22. The Same Emperors and C&sars to Plautianus.
There is no doubt that a trust can be left in the presence of witnesses, by
means of an ordinary letter or written request, and even without writing, but
merely by a sign.
Given at Byzantium, on the Idesof April, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors, 293.
23. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Stratonicus.
When the truth has not been ascertained, or any of the legal formalities have
not been complied with, and you have not carried out the alleged will of your
father by paying the bequests mentioned therein, or, for the purpose of making
a compromise, you have bound yourself by a stipulation, and the matter still
remains unaltered, you cannot be compelled to make payment.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors, 293.
24. The Same Emperors and Csssars to Menostratus.
Heirs are not required to surrender any instruments having reference to land
left under the terms of a trust, which serve to establish the title to the
same. They should, however, furnish security to deliver them to the legatee or
the beneficiary of the trust, if this should be necessary, and they are in
their possession.

Emperors, 293.
25. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Juliana.
There is no doubt that the private property of heirs can be left by the terms
of a trust.
Given on the second of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of the
Csesars, 293.
26. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Fortunatus.
Where proper cause is shown, the exception on the ground of fraud can be
pleaded when a trust is rejected, and he to whom it was left attempts to avail
himself of his rejection; this, however, cannot be pleaded against you, as you
allege that not you, but your father, who was not able to injure you, committed
this act.
Given on the second of the Idesof April, during the Consulate of the Caesars,
293.
27. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Olympias.
Where anyone who left a trust is proved to have changed his mind, his heirs
cannot be compelled to execute it.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 294.
28. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Tiberius.
Freedom cannot be demanded by slaves under the terms of a trust which was
illegally created subject to a condition, and without granting freedom to the
slaves.
Given on the Kalendsof November, under the Consulate of the
Csesars, 294.
29. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Achilles.
A trust which is not legally valid cannot be claimed under the terms of a will,
if the heirs charged with it are not proved to have succeeded on the ground of
intestacy.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the
Csesars, 294.
30. The Emperor Justinian to Demosthenes, Prsstorian Prefect.
As that wise and shrewd man, Papinianus, who deservedly excels all others, has
stated in his Opinions that where anyone appointed his son his heir, and
subjected him to the burden of giving up his estate after his death, he will
not be considered to have made such a testamentary disposition, unless his son
should die without issue, We, having adopted this opinion as reasonable, do
give it full effect, so that, if anyone should make such a disposition of his
estate, and should not only appoint his son his heir, but also his daughter,
or, in the first place, should appoint his grandson or granddaughter, or his
great-grandson or his great-granddaughter, or any of his other descendants, and
subject them to the burden of giving up his estate after his death, he shall be
considered not to have had any other intention, if those who were charged with
the transfer of the
estate should die without leaving either sons or daughters, grandsons or
granddaughters, or great-grandsons or great-granddaughters; in order that the
testator may not appear to have preferred foreign heirs to his own descendants.
Read for the seventh time in the New Consistory of the Palace of Justinian.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof November, during the fifth Consulate of
Decius, 529.
31. The Same Emperor to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
A certain man liberated his son from paternal control, and afterwards, having
made his will and appointed other heirs, passed him over, leaving him
absolutely nothing. He, however, charged him with the execution of a trust,
although he had neither appointed him his heir, nor disinherited him.
The question arose whether a trust of this kind was valid; therefore, for the
purpose of removing all doubts formerly entertained on this point, We have
decided in this case that an emancipated son (as he has been injured by his
father), shall not be compelled to execute a trust with which he has been
charged; and We order that this rule shall apply to other persons whom it is
necessary to disinherit.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Kalendsof March, after the fifth
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
32. The Same to John, Praetorian Prefect.
For the purpose of deciding any question of fact which may hereafter arise, and
with a view to consulting the wishes of deceased persons, We order that where a
trust has been left without having been reduced to writing, and without the
presence of witnesses, and the beneficiary of the same chooses to tender the
oath to the heir, or to the legatee, or the trustee, whenever any of them has
been charged with a trust, either generally or in specified terms, the heir,
the legatee, or the trustee must be sworn before the oath of calumny is taken,
and will divest himself of all anxiety.
When, however, he thinks that he ought to refuse to take the oath, or is
unwilling to produce the certain share or amount left to the beneficiary of the
trust, and the latter has reason to expect a larger sum, he shall, by all
means, be compelled to do what is required by the beneficiary, and satisfy him,
as he himself acts as both judge and witness whose honor and good faith has
been conceded by the beneficiary of the trust, and no witnesses, or other
evidence shall be necessary.
But whether five witnesses or a smaller number, or, indeed, none at all, were
present, for the reason that the oath was neither taken nor refused, the case
shall be proved as required, whether a father or a stranger was the person who
created the trust, so that justice may equally be done to all parties. For when
the facts are established by the solemn oaths of witnesses, then the number of
the latter
51
prescribed by law must be obtained, and all the formalities complied with. The
law requires several witnesses, in order to prevent a forged will from being
established by the evidence of only two, so that the truth may be ascertained
more perfectly by the testimony of a larger number.
But when anyone who profits by the will of the deceased (and above all, the
heir himself, to whom is committed the entire authority in a case of this kind)
is compelled to speak the truth by the administration of the oath, what ground
will there be for the introduction of witnesses; or why should recourse be had
to the evidence of strangers, when a certain and undoubted truth is established
by a refusal to be sworn?
In framing this legislation, We have taken into consideration the fact that
heirs,are, by all means, obliged to carry out the just dispositions of deceased
persons; and these laws are so strict that they even provide that the benefit
of an estate shall be lost by those who fail to obey the orders of the
testator.
Extract from Novel 1, Chapter I. Latin Text.
Moreover, if anyone, having been warned by the judge, does not, within a year,
carry out the wishes expressed in the will of the deceased, he shall be
excluded from the benefit of what he would obtain under the said will, with the
exception of what he is naturally entitled to, and this should only be granted
under the condition of his giving a bond to comply with the testamentary
provisions; in the first place so far as the substitutes are concerned, and
afterwards with reference to the co-heirs in their regular order, or to the
general beneficiary of a trust, or a sole legatee; or, when there are several
legatees, to the one having the preference; or to the special beneficiary of a
trust; or to a legatee entitled to the largest amount; or to all of the
legatees; to those who consent; or to slaves who have received their freedom by
the will; according to the order in which each of the preceding persons is
mentioned. In this instance, however, disinherited children shall not be
considered, and finally, in default of other heirs the estate shall go to the
heirs at law, or be forfeited to the Treasury.
TITLE XLIII.
REGULATIONS WHICH ARE EQUALLY APPLICABLE TO LEGACIES AND TRUSTS, AND CONCERNING
THE ABOLITION OF THE ACT OF PLACING THE PARTY INTERESTED IN POSSESSION OF THE
PROPERTY BEQUEATHED.
1. The Emperor Justinian to Demosthenes, Prsetorian Prefect.
While those who are favored in the bequests of legacies and trusts are known to
be fully entitled to every personal right of action, who approves of bringing a
suit for recovery of property, either on the ground of permission, or of any
other subtle distinction applicable to
other kinds of legacies, when such measures are not now adopted, or readily
undertaken, and those involved methods are no longer sanctioned? Who at present
makes use of the minute technicalities relative to the placing of a legatee in
possession?
Hence We think that it is better to absolutely abolish the latter proceeding,
and to render all legatees as well as beneficiaries of trusts subject to a
single rule, and We grant them not only the personal but also the real action,
so that they may be permitted to recover by means of a real action whatever has
been left them by a bequest of any kind, or under the terms of a trust, and, in
addition to this, We grant them the equitable Servian or hypothecary action,
for any property left them, out of other assets forming part of the estate of
the deceased.
By this law of Ours, the testator is permitted to hypothecate any of the
property disposed of by his will, to whomever he chooses; and the New
Constitutions, in many cases, introduced tacit hypothecations, so that it is
not unreasonable for Us to grant the hypothecary action in the present
instance, which could not be inferred, through any previous expressions, to be
found in the law itself. For when a testator left legacies or trusts in such a
way that those benefited by them could obtain them, it is apparent from his
will that the abovementioned actions ought to be brought against the property
of the testator, and his will be complied with in every respect, and especially
when the legacies or trusts are of such a nature as to be attributable to
motives of affection.
We make these provisions, not only where a legacy or a trust has been created
to be executed by the heir, but where a trust was left to anyone to be executed
by a legatee or a trustee, or any other person whom we can charge with a trust.
For as a trust is not valid unless it confers some advantage upon the party
charged with its execution, there is nothing oppressive in granting not only
the personal, but also the real and the hypothecary actions against him, with
reference to the property which he obtained from the testator.
In all cases of this kind, however, We desire every one to be sued by the
hypothecary action only to the extent of his liability in the personal one, and
the hypothecary action does not affect the property of the heir himself, or
that of any other person charged with the administration of the trust, but
solely that which came to him from the testator.
Given at Chalcedon, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof October, during the fifth
Consulate of Decius, 529.
2. The Same Emperor to Julian, Praetorian Prefect.
Every word which clearly indicates the intention of a testator who desires to
bequeath property as a legacy, or under a trust, shall be lawful and valid;
whether this is done by direct statements, such as "I order," or whether the
testator makes use of those denoting a request, for instance, "I beg," "I
desire," "I direct," "I leave in trust;" or whether he requires an oath, which
has been done in Our presence,
the testator making use of the expression, "I call God to witness," the other
parties in turn repeating this after him.
Therefore as We have already stated, a will shall not be considered without
force so far as its general construction is concerned, no matter what the words
bestowing the legacies or trusts may be; and everything which is naturally
inserted in legacies is understood to belong there; and when something is
inserted in a trust which should not have been, it is understood to be
bequeathed; and if anything appears which does not partake of the nature of a
legacy, this shall be held to have been left under the terms of a trust; so
that every disposition of this kind may be carried out, and actions in rem,as
well as hypothecary and personal actions, may be founded" upon any
of them.
Where, however, something contrary to law appears in the bequests of legacies
and trusts, this will either be added to the trust or the legacy, as the case
may be; which is more consonant with justice, and will, in this way, be
disposed of in accordance with its character. Let no one, at the time of his
death, think that his lawful will shall be rejected, but he can always rely
upon Our assistance, and as We provide for those who are living, so also care
is taken of the interests of the dead. Where the testator only makes special
mention of a legacy, this may be considered both a legacy and a trust; and if
anything is committed to the care of the heir or legatee, it shall be
considered as a legacy; for We do not impose laws upon words but upon the
property itself.
Given at Constantinople, on the tenth of the Kalendsof March, after the fifth
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
3. The Same Emperor to John, Praetorian Prefect.
When the selection of a slave or other property is left to two or three men, or
more, or if the choice of a slave or some other property is bequeathed to one
legatee and the latter, at his death, left several heirs, it was doubted by the
ancient authorities what decision should be made, if a dispute should arise
among the legatees or the heirs of the aforesaid legatee, and one of them
wished to choose one slave, or some article, and another another.
Hence We order that, in all cases of this kind, the casting of lots shall be
resorted to, and fortune decide the question, and whoever succeeds shall have
the right to make the choice; and with reference to the others, the amount of
their shares shall be placed with the appraised value of the other assets; that
is to say, in the case of a male or a female slave, if he or she is over ten
years of age, and has no trade, the valuation shall be twenty solidi;but those
who are under ten years of age shall not be considered as worth more than ten
solidi.Where, however, they are skilled artisans, whether they are males or
females, their value shall be appraised up to thirty solidi,except in the cases
of notaries and physicians of both sexes, as We desire notaries to be valued at
fifty solidi,and physicians and midwives at sixty. Eunuchs under the age of ten
years shall be valued as high as
thirty solidi,and those who are older up to fifty, but if they are skilled in
some trade, they shall be valued up to seventy solidi.
(1) Where anyone leaves the choice of a slave or other property, not to the
legatee himself, but to someone else, for instance, to Titius; and Titius
refuses to make the choice, or is unable to do so, or is prevented by death; in
this instance, a doubt arose among the ancients as to what conclusion should be
arrived at; whether the legacy should be held to have been annulled, or whether
relief could be granted so that the selection might be made in accordance with
the judgment of a good citizen.
Therefore, We decree that if the person who was directed to make the choice,
should fail to make it within the term of a year, or should be unable, or
should die at any time before doing so; the right shall be considered to have
been granted to the legatee himself, provided, however, that he does not select
the best one of the slaves or other property, but only such as is of average
value, in order that, while We think that the legatee should be favored, the
heir may not be deprived of the advantages to which he is entitled.
(2) But, for the reason that We have, in many instances, provided for the
interests of the beneficiaries of legacies and trusts, and have granted them
not only personal actions but real and hypothecary ones, and have abolished the
perplexing formality required in granting possession of property; We now
promulgate the following law.
No heir shall hereafter be permitted under the authority of the ancient laws to
alienate, or encumber by pledge or hypothecation, or by the manumission of
slaves, any property which has been bequeathed either absolutely as a legacy,
or left dependent upon a condition of time, or to be transferred to others, or
delivered under a substitution; but he is hereby notified that he cannot
subject to the control of another what does not belong to him also, just as if
it was a part of his patrimonial estate; because it would be both absurd and
unreasonable for him to be able to transfer to others property which he does
not possess as his own, or to encumber the same either by hypothecation or
pledge, or to manumit slaves which are not his, and thwart the expectations
entertained by others.
(3) Where, however, a legacy or a trust has been left either generally or
specially under a condition, or to take effect at some uncertain time, or
subject to substitution or restitution; the party interested will do well in
cases of this kind to avoid making any sale or hypothecation, in order not to
expose himself to the serious difficulties resulting from eviction. But if,
induced by avarice, and with the hope that the condition will not be complied
with, he should venture to sell or hypothecate the property, he is hereby
notified that, in case the condition should be fulfilled, the transaction will
be considered void from the beginning, and be understood as not having been
written, or to have taken place; so that neither usucaption nor prescription of
long time will run against the legatee or the beneficiary of the trust.
We decree that the same rule shall also apply to legacies of this description
whether they have been left absolutely, or to vest at a certain date, or
conditionally, or at some uncertain time. In all these instances, the legatee
or the beneficiary shall have full authority to bring suit to recover the
property in question, and to obtain possession of the same, without the person
who holds it being able to interpose any obstacle to prevent him from doing so.
Extract from Novel 39, Chapter I. Latin Text.
Property which is subject to restitution is forbidden to be alienated or
encumbered. If, however, the lawful share of the children does not prove
sufficient to satisfy the obligations of the dowry, or donation on account of
marriage, it is permitted to alienate or encumber the above mentioned property
for this purpose, in a manner suitable to the positions of the persons
interested; for We desire to make provision for those matters which are of
advantage to all parties, rather than for those which only affect the interests
of a few.
END OF THE EXTRACT.
THE TEXT OF THE CODE FOLLOWS.
(4) A purchaser who knows that the property is encumbered will only be entitled
to an action against the vendor for the recovery of the price, and not for
double damages under a stipulation; nor will he be allowed anything for
improvements, as it will be sufficient for him to recover the price which he
knowingly paid for what belonged to another.
Where the property has been pledged, the counter action of pledge will lie in
favor of the creditor against the debtor; and We make this provision so that,
under all circumstances, the effect of which We always desire to accomplish may
be produced, and the last wills of deceased persons may be observed. There is
no doubt that the rights of purchasers in good faith will remain unimpaired,
and in no respect affected by the terms of this Constitution, as they will
continue to enjoy them against vendors.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof September, after the fifth Consulate
of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
TITLE XLIV.
CONCERNING FALSE STATEMENTS MADE IN THE CASE OF LEGACIES OR TRUSTS.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Septimus.
The words of the will which you have inserted in your petition, either state
that the money due the testator has been paid, or they plainly show that his
intention was to discharge the debtor. Therefore, either what has been paid
cannot be collected, or proceedings must be instituted as under a trust, in
order that the debtor may be released from liability; unless it can clearly be
established that the
testator did not intend to release him, but, erroneously thought that the money
had been paid to himself.
Published on the seventh of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of
Antoninus, Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
2. The Emperor Alexander to Faustina.
Even if the truth with reference to a debt does not appear, the false statement
does not render the bequest void, and an action based on the will will lie in
the name of the testator.
Published on the seventh of the Idesof November, during the Consulate of
Alexander, 223.
3. The Same Emperor to Verina.
If your husband left you property by way of dowry without designating the
amount of the same, but stated that whatever had come or might come into his
hands, should be considered as your dowry, and you bring suit for it under the
will; proof of the amount of money which he received will be necessary. If,
however, he mentioned the sum, it will be due; and if it is not paid as dowry
but as something else that is bequeathed, it will not be subject to the same
rules of law as a dowry.
Published on the Nonesof May, during the Consulate of Maximus, Consul for the
second time, and .^Elianus, 224.
4. The Emperor Gordian to Alexander.
If, as you allege, your wife having died during marriage you returned her dowry
to her father; or, even if you did not return it, if you can prove by the words
of the will (as you assert you can) that your father-in-law received all of
said dowry, an action will not lie against you on this ground, and you should
be under no apprehension, for the dowry has either been paid, and you can not
be sued; or, if it has not been paid, you will be entitled to an exception
against the person claiming under the will of the deceased.
Published on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of
Sabinus, Consul for the second time, and Venustus, 241.
5. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian and the Caesars to Severn.
It makes a great difference whether your husband bequeathed your dowry to you
as a legacy, or whether he left you, in general terms, whatever was inserted in
the dotal instrument; for, in the first instance, you can only claim what you
prove was given; and in the second, whatever is mentioned in the dotal
instrument can be demanded under it, without a false allegation having any
effect.
Given on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 293.
TITLE XLV.
CONCERNING LEGACIES OR TRUSTS LEFT FOR A SPECIFIC PURPOSE.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Saturnina.
The purpose for which legacies and trusts were bequeathed must be observed,
just as in the case of a condition. But you are not obliged to obey the will of
the testator, as this duty devolves upon him whom you were ordered to marry,
and if his wishes are not complied with, you will still obtain what was left to
you.
Published on the fifth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Gentianus and Bassus, 212.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Ammonius, Prsetorian Prefect.
Although no ground for the demand of a legacy or a trust arises from the
following words: "I leave to Titius ten thousand solidi,or an island, in order
that he may pay five thousand solidiout of the above mentioned sum to Msevius,
or transfer to him the said island"; still it is admitted as valid by the
Divine Severus; provided a bequest of freedom is'involved. But in pecuniary
matters, for the purpose of protecting the wills of testators, it is not
unreasonable that such a bequest should be allowed; so that, by expressions of
this kind, whether they have reference to a condition or to a purpose, or to
the gift of any property, or the performance of any act, an action based on the
trust will always lie, as in the case of conditions after they have
been fulfilled.
If, however, while leaving a legacy or a trust, the testator should forbid the
legatee or the beneficiary or his heir, or anyone else, to collect a certain
debt, the debtor will be entitled to an exception against the legatee or the
beneficiary of the trust, if he brings suit for a sum equal to that left as a
legacy or a trust.
Published on the sixth of the Idesof August, during the Consulate of Sabinus,
Consul for the second time, and Venustus, 261.
TITLE XLVI.
CONCERNING CONDITIONS INSERTED IN THE BEQUESTS OF LEGACIES, TRUSTS, AND GRANTS
OF FREEDOM.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Claudia.
As you allege that the testator left a trust to Trallianus to be carried out by
him whom he appointed heir to a portion of his estate, provided the person
appointed should die without children, and he should appoint his grandson, born
of his daughter, his heir; it is evident that the condition attached to the
trust has failed to be fulfilled, unless the intention of the testator is
clearly proved to have been
otherwise.
Published on the Nonesof December, during the Consulate of
Lateranus and Rufinus.
2. The Same Emperors to Gallianus.
As you assert that a father left a bequest to his daughter in trust, to be paid
at a certain time, and ordered that security should be given that this would be
done, if she did not separate from her husband; it is proper that the ordinary
rules of law should be observed in this case, and that no rescript should be
issued with reference thereto. The example of a legacy or an estate to which
the condition of a divorce is sometimes attached, should not be adduced in this
instance; as it would be absurd for the rule of the perpetual Edict to be
disregarded for the reason that the daughter did not obey the wishes of her
father.
Published at Antioch, on the eleventh of the Kalendsof August, under the second
Consulate of the Emperors Antoninus and Geta, 206.
3. The Emperor Antoninus to the Soldier Aurelius.
If Aulazanus bequeathed the legacy by his will, under the condition that the
legatee should reside with his concubine and her mother, and that he was to
blame for not obeying the wishes of the testator, as he, of his own accord,
failed to comply with the terms of the will, he should not be permitted to
claim the legacy.
Published on the sixth of the Idesof July, during the Consulate of Laetus,
Consul for the second time, and Cerealis, 216.
4. The Emperor Alexander to Licinia.
You have no reason to believe that you are entitled to a legacy or a trust left
to you by your uncle under the condition that you would marry his son, on the
ground that the condition was not complied with, because the son died before
you could marry him.
Published during the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of Alexander,
Consul for the second time, and Marcellus, 227.
5. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csssars, to Faustinus.
If it is shown that your wife, when you married her, was under the control of
her father, the property left to her under a trust at that time will
undoubtedly be acquired by her father, where nothing else exists to prevent it
from vesting in him. If, however, she was emancipated before her marriage, and
afterwards died leaving her father, her husband, and her children, she will
transmit to her heirs the right of action which she was entitled to bring for
the execution of the trust.
Ordered on the sixth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 293.
6. The Emperor Justinian to John, Prastorian Prefect.
When several persons are directed to comply with a certain condition, it was
doubted by Ulpian whether all of them should comply with it at once, or whether
each of them should be required to do so singly.
It appears to Us, however, that each of them should be required to comply with
the condition, in order to receive the share of the estate to which he was
entitled, so that those who obeyed the commands of the testator might enjoy the
benefit, and those who failed to do so could only blame themselves if they were
excluded from the advantages attaching to the observance of the condition.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Kalendsof August, after the fifth
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
7. The Same to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
A certain man, when making his will, granted freedom to his slave under the
condition that he should pay a certain number of solidito his heir, or should
give him some other property or another slave in his stead. As soon as the
slave (who did not reside in the same place as the heir) learned of the will of
his master, he hastened to the heir with what he had been ordered to give him,
but while on the way, he was deprived of the property which he was taking by an
attack of enemies, or some other accident, and the question arose among the
ancient authorities whether he should be prevented from obtaining his freedom,
because he could not, on account of the above-mentioned accidental occurrence,
give what was required by the condition. Hence, for the purpose of removing the
doubts of the ancients, We have decided that the slave is unquestionably
entitled to his freedom, and that the heir, or the stranger, shall not be
deprived of the benefit of what was left to him. Therefore, no matter from what
source the obstacle was derived, whether from the heir, or from him who was
ordered to give something to the latter, or whether it was the result of
accident, the slave shall, by all means, obtain his freedom, unless he himself
should refuse to comply with the condition; and even after he has obtained his
freedom he will be liable to the heir, or to the person to whom he was ordered
to give something (unless the latter refused to accept the money, and if this
was once rejected by him We do not permit him to change his mind), and he will
certainly be compelled to give what he was ordered, or to furnish the slave
designated by the testator, if he is still living; and if he is not, his value
shall be computed at not more than fifteen solidi;or if he was ordered to give
some other property, he must do so, provided it is still in existence, and if
it is not, he must pay the true value of the same.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Kalendsof May, after the fifth
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 532.
TITLE XLVII.
CONCERNING THE INTEREST AND THE PROFITS OF LEGACIES AND TRUSTS.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Maximus.
It is clear that interest on legacies and trusts can be collected from the time
when issue was joined. The income of property and the wages of slaves, due
under a will, must likewise be paid.
Published on the day before the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of
^milianus and Frontonus, 200.
2. The Emperor Antoninus to the Freedman of Cassianus.
It is well known that relief is afforded under the law against those who,
under* the pretext of witholding the Falcidian portion, are in default in the
payment of legacies. Therefore, if after a stipulation has been entered into,
you furnish security that you will return anything which you may receive over
and above what is allowed by this law, the judge having jurisdiction over
trusts will order the entire amount of the legacies to be paid to you.
If, however, you cannot furnish security, an arbiter having been appointed, he
shall designate a certain time for you, and if the other party fails to appear
within that time, he must perform his duty, and if he should find that there is
no ground for the operation of the Falcidian Law, you will receive the interest
and profits due from the time when issue was joined in the case.

two Aspers, 213.
3. The Emperor Alexander to Paternus.
If certain slaves have been left to you under the terms of a trust, they will

default.

Julian, Consul for the second time, and Crispinus, 225.
4. The Emperor Gordian to Dionysius.
In the case of legacies and trusts, the profits of the same shall be acquired
from the day when issue was joined in the case, and not from the time of the
death of the testator, whether a real or a personal action is brought.

CONCERNING THE TREBELLIAN DECREE OF THE SENATE.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Probus. If,in accordance with the
Decree of the Senate, you retained the fourth part of the estate, and delivered
the remaining three-fourths
to the beneficiary of the trust, you can recover from the latter the amount
which you paid to the creditors of the estate, instead of nine-twelfths of the
same.1

2. The Emperor Philip and the Csesar Philip to Julianus.
It is an undoubted rule of law that he to whom a share of an estate is left in
accordance with the Trebellian Decree of the Senate must assume the burdens of
the estate, or the payment of the legacies, in proportion to the share to which
he is entitled.

Peregrinus and ^milianus, 245.
3. The Emperors Cams, Carinus, and Numerianus to Zoticus and Others.
If the inheritance has been transferred to the State by means of a trust, you
will be entitled to restitution of the fourth part of the same, and its
profits, in accordance with the terms of the Trebellian Decree of the Senate,
and this also applies in case of intestacy.
Without date or designation of Consulate.
4. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Quintiana.
We do not see that you have any just reason for anxiety on account of the trust
which disposes of the remainder of the estate, apprehending that you will lose
the profits of the trust which has been bequeathed, because the grandmother of
the testator, having been appointed heir to a portion of his estate, and
requested by him to deliver it to you, deceitfully and fraudulently rejected
the same, in order that a share of the said estate might go to another
grandson, who was your co-heir, and through whom the trust was not expressly
left to you; and, having been compelled to enter upon the estate which was
suspected of being insolvent, she died before she performed any act as heir.
1 The heir was considered by the Romans to occupy the place of the testator,
and though he resembled the executor of modern times, he became liable for all
the debts of the estate if he accepted it. By the Trebellian Decree of the
Senate, enacted during the reign of Nero, it was provided that when the
inheritance was transferred to the fidei-commissarius,or beneficiary of the
trust, all rights ol action, for or against the heir, were likewise transferred
to the former, and, the hseres fiduciarius,or trustee, was released from all
liability for any claims which might be presented, whether the estate was
solvent or not.
This, however, was only the case where the entire estate was turned over to the
beneficiary of the trust, for if the fiduciary heir retained a fourth which, as
by virtue of the Falcidian Law, he was authorized to do under the Pegasian
Decree of the Senate, and an agreement was made to share pro ratawith the
beneficiary the advantages as well as the burdens, the Trebellian Decree was
not applicable.
Praetorian actions were granted for and against the beneficiary of the trust,
just as in the case of an heir at law.ED.
It was long since decided by the Divine Antoninus, Our relative, that a trust
was due even from substitutes, in consideration of the wishes of the testator,
just as if this had tacitly been required of them. You should have no fears, as
she who rejected the estate, and was compelled to enter upon it, could not
retain the fourth part in question.

of the above-mentioned Emperors.
5. The Same Emperors and Ciesars to Verissimus.
An estate can legally be left under a trust without writing. Therefore, if your
wife, being at the point of death, designated you and her step-son her heirs to
the amount of three-fourths of her estate, it is settled that her will must be
observed, she having provided that her heirs at law, who had agreed to the
execution of the trust, should, after the deduction of the indebtedness, only
obtain the amount which the Decree of the Senate authorized to be left them in
addition to the Falcidian fourth.
Ordered on the fifth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of the Caesars.
6. The Emperor Zeno to Dioscorius, Praetorian Prefect.
We direct that whenever a father or mother, after having appointed their son or
daughter, or sons or daughters, heirs to equal or unequal shares of their
estates, substituted them simply for one another, or charged any one of them
who might die without issue to transfer his or her share of the estate to
either his or her surviving heir or co-heir; so that, in accordance with the
provisions of the Trebellian Decree of the Senate, the fourth part of the
estate might, under all circumstances, be reserved, and not be restored to the
bulk of the estate by implication (even though the testator requested or
ordered this to be done); but the other three-fourths of the property belonging
to the estate shall be transferred.
We order that the same rule shall apply to the reservation of the portion
provided for by the Falcidian Law, even though the father or mother, after
having appointed their son or daughter their heir (as above stated) should
charge him or her to deliver the estate to their grandsons or granddaughters,
their great-grandsons or great-granddaughters, or the descendants of the
latter.
(1) We order that in the above-mentioned cases no bond shall be required to
insure the execution of the trust, unless the testator expressly stated that
such a bond should be furnished, or when the father or mother thought that the
person charged with the execution of the trust ought not to contract a second
marriage. For in these two instances, that is to say, first, when the testator
expressly directed that security should be given, or second, where the father
or mother might marry again, it is necessary for the same security to be
furnished in accordance with the provisions of the law.
(2) If, however, he who has been charged with the execution of the trust should
die, leaving one son or a grandson by his son, or a
daughter by his son, or a great-grandson, or a posthumous child, the condition
will not be considered to have been complied with, and therefore the request
for the execution of the trust cannot be granted.
(3) We also give notice that what We have stated with reference to the
Falcidian portion being retained, not out of the income but out of the property
of the estate itself, and also concerning security being furnished by the
beneficiaries of a trust (as above mentioned) shall only apply to the persons
and cases above enumerated.
Published at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate
of Probinus and Eusebius, 489.
Extract from Novel 123, Chapter XXXVII. Latin Text.If those who have been
charged to transfer property given by way of dowry, or as a donation on account
of marriage, or under the condition that they shall marry and have children,
should enter a monastery, or any other religious house, or a transfer or
substitution should be made under the aforesaid conditions, or if this has been
done for the ransom of captives, or for the support of persons who are in want,
the execution of the trust cannot be demanded.
Extract from Novel 108, Chapter I. Latin Text.On the other hand, when anyone is
charged to transfer what remains of the estate at that time in case he should
die without issue, or where he is burdened with other provisions contained in a
trust of this kind, he will be compelled to deliver to the beneficiary of the
trust, the fourth part of what he has received as heir, and he must furnish
security to do so, unless he has been excused by the deceased. If, however, the
fourth should happen to be diminished, or should be obtained from the property
of the estate, or if this should be lacking, permission shall be given to the
beneficiary of the trust to proceed by a real and an hypothecary action against
those who have received the property. The diminution of the said fourth is
allowed in the case of a dowry, or a donation in consideration of marriage, or
where captives are to be ransomed, or sufficient assets are not available to
pay expenses. 7. The Emperor Justinian to Julian, Prsetorian Prefect.We order
that permission shall be given to make restitution to a sole guardian of the
entire trust left to his ward, without his being required to furnish security,
whenever the ward cannot speak for himself, or is known to be absent, in order
that We may not prescribe to too many restrictions with reference to the
affairs of wards, and these restrictions redound to their injury.
The same rule shall apply where an estate is due to an insane person under a
trust, so that restitution shall be made to his curator alone, in the name of
the insane person. For what understanding and what reason can be attributed to
one who is not of sound mind, when, in both instances, those who make the
restitution enjoy the greatest security under Our law?
This rule shall also be observed if the ward himself, or the insane person, is
required to make restitution.
(1) When anyone is directed to transfer an estate to others, and fraudulently
or obstinately conceals himself either before or after issue has been joined in
the case; or where he is charged with the execution of a trust, and, before he
transfers the estate dies, leaving no heir or successor; or where the
beneficiary of a trust to whom an estate has been transferred under the
Trebellian Decree of the Senate is ordered under the terms of the same to
transfer the property belonging to the estate to a third party; a doubt arose
among the ancient authorities as to how the assignments of the rights of action
in these three cases should be made. Domitius Ulpianus was of the opinion that
a constitution should be promulgated with reference to these cases, and
therefore We order that where he who was required to transfer the property
absented himself through perverseness, or, having died, left no successor, or
was the first beneficiary of the trust and was charged to transfer the property
to a second, the praetorian rights of action pass by operation of law.
Given at Constantinople, on the tenth of the Kalendsof November, under the
fifth Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
8. The Same Emperor to John, Praetorian Prefect.
A certain man, having made his will, directed his heir to transfer to another
the entire estate which he left to him, and then charged him with a special
trust. The question arose from whom the special beneficiary could obtain what
was bequeathed to him, whether from the heir, so that, after the transfer, the
first beneficiary might receive something else, or whether this, together with
the other property, should all be included in the trust, so that the general
might transfer it to the special beneficiary, when what was embraced in the
trust consisted of money or other property. Therefore, We order that all the
estate shall be delivered to the general beneficiary in accordance with the
Trebellian Decree of the Senate, and that he shall be required to deliver to
the special beneficiary what was bequeathed to him.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof November, after the
fifth Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 532.
TITLE L. ON THE FALCIDIAN LAW.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Priscus.
You ought to know that if you have rejected the Falcidian portion, in order
that you may be the better able to transfer your share, you will not be
considered to have paid more than you owed.
Published on the third of the Idesof May, during the Consulate of Lateranus and
Rufinus, 198.
2. The Same Emperors to Sactianus.
It is a certain and established principle of law that the rule of the Falcidian
portion applies to all persons in proportion to the amount of the legacies and
trusts.
Published on the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Lateranus and Rufinus,
198.
3. The Emperor Alexander to Hermagoras.
Even if it should appear that the heir administered an implied trust, there is
no doubt that, notwithstanding this, the legacies and trusts left by the will
must be paid in the same proportion permitted by the Falcidian Law, as it has
been decided that the legatee cannot profit by the fourth of which the heir was
deprived, because he endeavored to dispose of the estate contrary to law.
Published on the Idesof October, during the Consulate of the Emperor Alexander,
223.
4. The Same Emperor to Philetianus.
It was very properly decided by the Divine Hadrian that the Falcidian Law
applies to legacies left to the Emperor.

Emperor Alexander, 223.
5. The Same Emperor to Damosata.
If you can prove that your mother made excessive donations mortis causato your

the Constitutions of My grandfather, the Divine
Severus.

Maximus, Consul for the second time, and Julianus, 224.
6. The Same Emperor to Secondina.
All debts are deducted in the enforcement of the Falcidian Law, even those due
to the heir himself at the time of the death of the testator, although the
actions are merged by acceptance of the estate.
(1) Moreover, all legacies, even though intended to be expended in public
works, or for the erection of statues, are required to contribute pro
rata,according to their amounts, in order to make up the Falcidian
portion.
(2) The computation of the lawful amount shall not be affected if the heir
should pay more than what is due, or perform more than is required.
Ordered on the fifth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and ^lianus, 224.
7. The Same to Primus and Pomponius.
The Falcidian Law does not apply to military wills, but if the deceased had
possession of property belonging to you, it can, by no means, be considered
part of his estate, and therefore you can legally require an account to be
rendered of it in the case of a debt.
Published on the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Alexander, Consul for
the second time, and Marcellus, 227.
Extract from, Novel 1, Chapters II and III. Latin Text.
If the testator expressly forbade any restrictions to be placed upon the
distribution of his estate, the Falcidian Law will not apply, and if the heir
does not obey the deceased in this respect, the estate shall pass to the
persons enumerated under the Title having reference to legacies and trusts.
Again, if the heir, being aware of the amount of the assets of the estate, pays
some of the legacies in full, and others only in part, he cannot recover or
retain anything from either, unless some unexpected occurrence should take
place. Where nothing of this kind occurs, there will be ground for the
Falcidian Law, provided, at the time of the acceptance of the estate, an
inventory is drawn up in accordance with the method and term prescribed by law.
The inventory shall be made in the presence of all the legatees of the city, or
in that of their agents, if this can be done; and when any one of them is
absent, or refuses to be present, his place shall be supplied by three
witnesses of the same town, who are men of wealth and good reputation, without
prejudice to ascertaining the truth by the torture of slaves, and the heir and
the witnesses shall be sworn.
If these formalities are not observed, the heir must pay the legacies in full,
even though their value may exceed that of the estate. No controversy or legal
proceeding of this kind shall be prolonged for more than a year, for after the
lapse of that time, through the fault of the heir, the estate shall pass to the
others.
Extract from Novel 131, Chapter XII. Latin Text.
The Falcidian Law does not apply where property is bequeathed under the
condition that it shall not be alienated, but shall remain in the hands of the
successors of him to whom it was left.
Extract from Novel 119, Chapter XI. Latin Text.
In like manner, the Falcidian Law does not apply to property left for pious
uses.
8. The Same Emperor to Aurelius.
The will of your brother cannot be considered void for the mere fact that he
was bound, under the terms of the trust, to transfer your father's estate to
you if he should die first without issue. But although, as you assert, he
appointed you his heir, and burdened you with the payment of legacies, what was
due under the trust should be deducted as indebtedness, and, in addition to
this, you can claim the benefit of the Falcidian Law with reference to the
remainder of the estate.

9. The Emperor Gordian to Mestrianus.
An heir is not prevented from claiming the lawful fourth when, through an error
of fact, he failed to retain it in the execution of a trust; but if he, being
aware that he could retain it, transferred the entire estate, he will not be
entitled to a personal action for recovery,
for the reason that if he had been ignorant of the law, he would have had no
right to make the demand.
Published on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of
Pius and Pontianus.
10. The Same Emperor to Diogenes.
Although your father charged your brother to transfer a share of his estate to
you, in case he died without issue, still, if he died intestate, what he was
entitled to under the Falcidian Law will belong to his legal successor; and
therefore, not without reason, your sister, who as heir at law, succeeded to
him along with you, can clearly claim her share of what he could have retained.

11. The Same Emperor to Maximus.
If (as you allege) your father ordered you to transfer to your brothers the

will not be prevented from demanding the aid of the Falcidian Law for which you
petition.

13. The Same Emperors and Ciesars to Zethus.
If she, who you say holds your son as her slave, obtained anything by the will
of the deceased, who bequeathed freedom to the said slave under the terms of a
trust, it is not unjust for her to be compelled to grant the slave his liberty,
in accordance with the provisions of the will; for the execution of the trust
with which she was charged can be demanded, even where the value of the slave
whom she was requested to manumit exceeds that of the legacy.

Although you have entered upon the estate of your father, and the right of
action, to which you assert you were entitled, has been extinguished by merger
with the share to which you succeeded through him, for which reason you allege
that you became liable for a considerable sum on account of your administration
of the guardianship, you
will not be prevented from suing your co-heirs in proportion to the remaining
shares, and you will be required to transfer the land left to you in trust,
after having deducted the fourth part to which you are entitled.

15. The Same Emperors and Cassars to Pomponius.
If your wife, either by her will or by a codicil, ordered that the instruments
evidencing the title to lands forming part of her dowry, and to which you were
legally entitled, should be given to you under a trust, her successors can be
compelled to carry out the provisions of her will; for the instruments
evidencing the title to the lands having been bequeathed to their owner, there
can be no question whatever as to the application of the Falcidian Law.

18. The Emperor Justinian to John, Prtetorian Prefect.
Where anyone, having an estate, for instance of the value of four hundred
solidi,directs his heir not to enter upon it, unless he first pays to a certain
person three hundred and eighty solidi,or any sum which will diminish the
Falcidian fourth, We order that if the heir should enter upon the estate, he
shall still have the benefit of the Falcidian portion, and can reserve whatever
is lacking to make it up, and before either giving or retaining it (whether
there is but one transfer provided by the will, or whether the estate is to be
divided among several persons) he shall be entitled to the benefit of the
above-mentioned law without any alteration.
Where, however, a donation mortis causawas made, and it exceeds the amount
fixed by the Falcidian Law, the heir, after entering upon the estate, can
recover the excess which was actually given over and above the sum allowed by
the said law, but which remains as part of the estate of the testator; for why,
in the present instance, should We not provide for the interests of both the
living and the dead, by seeing
that the last wills of the latter are executed, and that the advantages derived
from the estate to which the former are entitled are not diminished?
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof November, after the
fifth Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
19. The Same Emperor to John, Praetorian Prefect.
As it is certain that the heir who has fully carried out the wishes of the
testator by paying all the legacies in full cannot afterwards, by claiming the
benefit of the Falcidian Law, recover anything from the legatees on the ground
that he has complied with the will of the testator, therefore, We order that
this principle shall also obtain where the heir has furnished security for the
payment of the legacies in full, which is a question with reference to which a
doubt arose among the ancient jurists. For to both cases, that is to say,
whether he paid the legacies or furnished security that he would do so, the
rule of equity would seem to be equally applicable.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof November, after the
fifth Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 532.
TITLE LI.
CONCERNING THE ABOLITION OF THE FORFEITURES OF SUCCESSIONS TO THE STATE.
1. The Emperor Justinian to the Senate of the City of Constantinople.
We have considered it necessary, 0 Conscript Fathers, in the peaceful days of
Our Empire, to banish from the Roman world both the name and substance of
forfeiture of property, which originated in and was augmented by the civil wars
in which the Roman people were formerly engaged, and that what the calamity of
war introduced the beneficence of peace should abolish. And as the Lex
Papiahas, in many respects, been amended by former emperors, and has finally
fallen into desuetude, We desire that the practice of forfeitures may, by Our
agency, lose its invidious force, which was displeasing to the most eminent
jurists, who invented many ways to prevent it from
taking effect.
Its observation appeared so grievous to testators themselves that they
introduced substitutions to avoid complying with it, and, by means of them,
caused their estates to pass to certain persons, thus evading the regulations
which the Lex Papiaimposed upon estates left without heirs, which We also
permit to be done. And as the Lex Papia,by its contrivances and technicalities,
practically annulled the ancient law which, before its passage, was strictly
enforced against everyone, and did not hesitate to impose its yoke upon the
ascendants and descendants of the testator, as far as the third degree, only
preserving for them the benefits of the ancient law, if they had been appointed
heirs, We, on the other hand, concede this advantage to all Our subjects
without distinction of person.
(1) Therefore, as the Lex Papiaderived its object and origin of forfeitures
from the acceptance of the possession of estates of deceased persons, and for
that reason the Decrees of the Senate enacted with reference to the Papian Law
ordered the forfeiture of legacies riot to date from the death of the testator,
but from the time when the will was opened, it was held that if, in the
meantime, they failed to vest, this would cause a forfeiture. We, in the first
place, correcting this rule, and renewing the ancient law, do hereby order that
all persons shall have the right to enter upon an estate from the day of the
death of the testator; and that, in like manner, legacies and trusts, whether
they are left absolutely, or to vest at a certain time, shall be payable from
the date of the testator's death.
(2) And as testamentary bequests were annulled in three ways, it is proper to
plainly designate the times and the names of the same, so that whatever is
repealed or amended may not remain unknown. One of these is where property is
left to persons who were not living at the time when the will of the testator
was executed, he perhaps being ignorant of the fact, and the laws considered
such bequests as not having been written; or, in another instance, when the
person entitled to something under the will died after it was executed, but
during the lifetime of the testator; or when a legacy left under a condition
failed to vest because the condition was not complied with, a case to which the
ancients applied the term "in causa caduci."
Another instance was where, after the death of the testator, what was left did
not vest in the legatee, because it was plainly stated to be forfeited.
(3) Therefore, in the first instance, where the testator left property to
persons who had died before his will was executed, which were dispositions
considered as not having been made, it was decided that legacies of this kind
should remain in the hands of those to whom they had been left, unless they
were already deceased, or a substitute had been appointed, or a co-legatee had
been added, for then they did not fail to vest, but came into their hands
without any burden, unless (which very rarely occurred) when they were
considered as not having been bequeathed at all. We, approving of the
benevolence of the ancients, and induced by natural reason, have decreed that
this provision shall remain unaltered, and shall be observed hereafter for all
time.
(4) With reference to the second case, which occurred when the property came
under the head of in causa caduci,We, for the purpose cf amending the ancient
law, do hereby order that when this takes place the property shall, in like
manner, remain in the hands of those who were charged with its distribution, as
for instance, the heirs, the legatees, or other persons who can be compelled to
execute a trust; unless in the case where a substitute, a co-heir, or a co-
legatee has previously been appointed. All persons, however, who will profit by
such a disposition, must also sustain the burdens which were imposed by it in
the beginning, whether this consists of giving something, performing some act,
complying with a condition, or carrying out what
has been planned in any other way whatsoever; for it should not be tolerated
that he who enjoys the benefit of a bequest should be able to reject the
inconveniences attaching to the same.
(5) In the last instance, where the property, properly speaking, becomes
forfeited, as We have previously stated, We decree that as long as the will
remains unopened, the persons mentioned therein can not only appear as heirs,
but can also enter upon the estate, whether they have been appointed heirs to a
portion, or to the whole of the same; and the time for the vesting of legacies
and trusts shall, as We have already mentioned, date from the death of the
deceased. For the ancient authorities did not permit the estate to pass, unless
it was entered upon, nor do We suffer it, except in the case of children,
concerning whom the law of the Emperor Theodosius, which was introduced with
reference to cases of this kind, makes provision; still, with reference to
those who die while still deliberating, it has been decided by us that the law
shall remain in full force.
(6) There is no doubt whatever that execution of grants of freedom, which, on
account of their nature, are dependent upon the acceptance of the estate by the
heir, can be demanded, according to the present law, from the time the estate
is entered upon, as well as other provisions by which slaves were manumitted by
the will, or bequests were left to other legatees. The usufruct of property,
however, as it cannot, on account of its nature, be transmitted to the heirs of
the legatee, because so far as its transfer is concerned, the time when it
vests does not date from the death of the testator, nor from the day of the
acceptance of the estate.
We order that all these provisions shall be observed in accordance with the
aforesaid regulations relating to property which has been left unconditionally,
or the right to which is to vest at a specified time.
(7) When, however, anything has been left under a condition, whether
accidental, potential, or mixed, the fulfillment of which is dependent upon
chance or the will of the person to be benefited, or upon both; or upon an
indefinite time; the fulfillment of the condition under which the bequest was
made, or the date must be waited for; as the condition should be complied with,
or the indefinite time arrive. But if, meanwhile, he who is to be benefited by
the provisions of the will should die, and the condition was not complied with
during his lifetime, and the property, on this account, did not go to the
person to. whom it was intended, We decree that it shall, in like manner,
remain in the hands of those charged with its delivery; unless, in this
instance also, a substitute may obtain the bequest, or a co-heir or a co-
legatee may acquire it for himself, as it is a positive rule of law that a
substitution can be made in the case of the appointment of heirs, in the
bequest of legacies, in the creation of trusts, and in donations mortis causa.
(8) But in order that it may clearly appear what shares can be obtained by
those charged with the delivery of legacies, through the failure of conditions,
or otherwise, We order that if any profit accrues to the heirs, the
distribution of the same shall be made in proportion
to their shares of the estate, as they would have been compelled to transfer it
in the same manner if the bequest had been valid, unless one or several of the
said heirs had been expressly charged with its delivery; for then, just as he
or they alone must have paid the legacy, so they will be entitled to enjoy the
benefit of the same. When, however, the legatees or beneficiaries of the trust,
or persons favored with a donation mortis caMsa,or indeed any others who can be
designated for this purpose, were charged with the delivery of the property,
the right to the same disappears, and We direct it to be divided into equal
shares among the persons above mentioned, that is to say, according to their
number.
(9) In order that what that most accomplished man, Ulpianus, so properly and so
clearly stated may not be passed by without notice, We publicly give it Our
sanction. For as We have already decided that property which is bequeathed
shall pass with all its charges to the person who is benefited by it, We order
that, if when granting it, any condition or other burden should be prescribed,
those who are benefited shall, by all means, accept it along with the
advantages. If, however, some act is required to be performed, and this can be
done by another, it must, in like manner, be accepted by the beneficiary; for
instance, if he who was charged is directed to purchase, at his own expense, an
island, a monument, or something of this kind, either for the heir or the
legatee, or anyone else who may have been designated by the testator; or some
property is to be bought or leased by the heir of the testator; or a trust is
to be executed; or some other duty is to be performed; for it makes no
difference whether the act is to be done by the person mentioned by the
testator, or by someone else who profits by the bequest.
But if the meaning of the word, or the nature of the act, is such that what is
required by the bequest cannot be performed by another, then, although one
person may have the benefit, still he will not be compelled to sustain the
burden, because nature does not permit this, nor was it the intention of the
testator.
What course should be pursued where the testator ordered him to go to a certain
place, or take up liberal studies, or build a house with his own hands, or
paint a picture, or marry a wife? The intention of the testator is understood
to be that the person alone to whom he evinced his generosity should perform
all these acts.
This rule shall apply to all the above cases, so that the parties interested
may enjoy the benefit, and suffer the inconvenience, when this can be done. It
shall also apply to every instance to which the ancients gave the name of in
causa caducior caduca(as has been previously stated). It will, however, only be
applicable under certain circumstances, where the bequests are considered as
not having been written; for the reason that some of them are of such a nature
that they still pass with the charges imposed. We have directed that these
shall be especially enumerated in Our collection of new laws, in order that no
one may think that the prolixity of the ancient enactments should be, as it
were, necessary for the transaction of business, or to the science of
jurisprudence.
(10) These matters having been disposed of in this way, as in several places in
the first part of this law We made mention of the term "conjointly," We deem it
necessary that this part of Our Constitution shall be more carefully examined,
and more thoroughly discussed, so that, like the others, it may appear
perfectly clear to everyone. A bequest can not only be made conjointly, but
also separately. Therefore, if all the heirs are co-heirs, and appointed
conjointly, or all are appointed separately, or when they are substituted in
these ways, We decree that if the property which was left in any way was a
portion of the estate, but consisted of different shares, it shall be acquired
by the other co-heirs, together with its charges, in proportion to their
respective shares of the estate; and this shall accrue to them by operation of
law, even though they be unwilling to accept it, if they have already agreed to
take their shares of the estate, as it is absurd to accept one portion of an
estate and reject another, which point has already been settled by Our Imperial
decisions. Where, however, a distinction exists among the appointed heirs or
their substitutes, and some of them are named conjointly, and others
separately, then, if one of those mentioned conjointly should fail to accept
his share, it shall, by all means, go with its charges to those alone who have
been appointed conjointly, that is to say, in proportion to the shares of the
estate to which they are respectively entitled. But if any one of those who
have been appointed separately should fail to receive his share, it shall not
go to those alone who have been mentioned separately, but to all of the heirs
who have been mentioned conjointly, as well as separately, together with its
charges, in proportion to their shares of the estate.
This distinction has been introduced because those mentioned conjointly by the
same words of the testator are thereby constituted, as it were, a single
person, and acquire the share of their co-heir, just as if it was their own.
The separate heirs are, however, plainly distinguished by the words of the
testator, so that they can obtain what they are entitled to, but they cannot
individually acquire the share of another, but must obtain it conjointly with
all their co-heirs. These rules have been adopted only with reference to heirs.
(11) Moreover, where there are two or more legatees, or beneficiaries of a
trust, and something is left to them by will, if the bequest is made
conjointly, all will be entitled to the legacy, each one in proportion to his
share. If, however, one share, for some reason or other, cannot be given, We
decree that it shall accrue to all, in equal proportions if they wish to have
it, together with any charge with which it may be burdened; or if all are
unwilling to accept it, it shall then remain in the hands of those to whom it
was left as trustees. When, however, some of them are willing to accept it, and
others are not, it shall all go entirely to those who desire to have it. But
whenever the bequest was made separately, and all of them can and wish to
receive it, each one shall do so in proportion to his share. Let them, however,
not flatter themselves that one of them can obtain the entire estate and pay to
the others the value of their shares; for the ancients entertained different
opinions with reference to this avaricious dis-
position of legatees, as they adopted it with reference to one kind of a
legacy, and held that it should be rejected where others were concerned. We now
absolutely abolish this distinction, and give the same character to all kinds
of legacies and trusts, establishing, under such circumstances, an agreement
instead of the ancient dissension. Hence We order that unless the testator has
clearly and expressly provided that the entire estate shall go to one of the
legatees, the appraised value of the same shall- be paid to the others.
When, however, all the legatees to whom the property was left separately do not
agree as to its acquisition, but only one, for instance, is willing to accept
it, it shall all belong to him, because the intention of the testator seems, at
first sight, to have been to give the entire property to all the legatees; but
in case they are all willing to accept, their shares shall be taken from that
of the other legatee who obtained the entire estate, so that by the cooperation
of the others, the legacy of the former will be exhausted.
But where no one else appears, or can appear, then the share which was not
accepted shall not be considered to be without an owner, nor shall it accrue to
another, in order that the legacy of him who first accepted it may appear to be
increased, but it shall remain in the hands of him who has possession of the
same, without any diminution whatever.
Therefore, if the charge was imposed upon him, to whom in the first place the
legacy was left, he must, by all means, carry it out, in order to obey the will
of the testator. If, however, the one on whom it was imposed should fail to
execute it, he only who received the legacy directly, as his own, and not he
who succeeded him, will have his legacy diminished. But in order that the
reason for this distinction may not be obscure, We declare that the rule was
established so that the testator might seem to have left the property
separately, to enable each one to recognize that he was charged with a trust as
his own, and not as the representative of another, for if the deceased had
intended otherwise, there would have been no difficulty in disposing of the
property conjointly.
(12) We also retain unimpaired those provisions of the ancient laws which state
that persons who are unworthy shall be deprived of bequests, whether the said
bequests have been left to Our Treasury, or to someone else.
(13) We laid down in a preceding section of this law that an estate which has
not been accepted is not always transmitted to the heirs of the deceased, but
sometimes to other persons, and if the heir should not enter upon the estate as
a whole, it must go to his substitute, if he has one, and the latter can and
will accept it. When, however, this is not the case, the successors shall be
entitled to the estate on the ground of intestacy, or if there are none, or
they are unwilling to enter upon it, or for some reason are not entitled to
take it, it shall then go to Our Treasury.
(14) We decree that all these rules shall apply to both written and nuncupative
wills, as well as to codicils, and to every final dis-
position of property, as well as to anything left by an intestate, and to all
donations mortis causa.For We have bestowed Our clemency to such an extent
that, although We are aware that Our Treasury is entitled to all estates which
have no owners, still, We have abstained from claiming them, nor have We
demanded the privilege of the Emperor Augustus, but have decided that the
common welfare of all should be preferred to Our own advantage, considering
that the interest of Our subjects is identical with Our own.
(15) We have promulgated this law with reference to the last wills of deceased
persons, in order that it may be applicable to such cases as may occur
hereafter, for We permit former ones to be determined by the rules in force at
the time.
(16) We have decreed that all these regulations shall be brought before you, 0
Conscript Fathers, for your approval, in order that the efforts of Our
benevolence may not remain unknown to anyone, but that the Edicts, having been
solemnly published .by Our magistrates, may become familiar to all.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of Our
Lord Justinian, Consul for the fourth time, and Paulinus, Consul for the fifth
time, 534.
TITLE LII.
CONCERNING THOSE WHO CAN TRANSMIT AN ESTATE BEFORE THE WILL HAS BEEN OPENED.
1. The Emperors Theodosiiis and Valentinian to Hormisdas, Prse-torian Prefect.
We order by this law that hereafter sons, daughters, grandsons, granddaughters,
great-grandsons or great-granddaughters, who have been appointed heirs by the
written wills of their fathers or mothers, grandfathers or grandmothers, and
great-grandfathers or great-grandmothers, even though they may not have been
substituted for one another, whether they have been appointed with strangers,
or alone, can, before the will is opened (whether they know that they have been
appointed heirs or not), transmit such shares of the estate as have been left
to them to their descendants, without distinction of sex or degree. And the
aforesaid persons, provided they do not reject the estate, can claim it as due
to them, without any prescription being allowed against them. This rule is
applicable to legacies or trusts which have been left by a father, a mother, a
grandfather, a grandmother, a great-grandfather, or a great-grandmother. It
certainly would be very oppressive if, on account of some accidental
circumstance, or any of the events of life, that either grandsons or
granddaughters, great-grandsons or great-granddaughters should be deprived of
the estate of their grandparents or great-grandparents, and that others should
enjoy the unexpected benefit of a legacy contrary to the wishes of grandparents
or great-grandparents, as disclosed by the provisions of their wills. And,
indeed, as they are entitled
to consolation for their affliction, it is only reasonable that it should be
granted them.
Given on the third of the Nonesof April, after the Consulate of Protogenes and
Asterius, 450.
TITLE LIII. AT WHAT TIME A RIGHT TO LEGACIES OR TRUSTS VESTS.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Agrippa.
If you can prove before a competent judge that legacies of trusts, payable
annually, have been left to you, you will have the right to collect them at the
beginning of every year.
Published on the third of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of
Saturninus and Gallus, 199.
2. The Same Emperor to Priscus.
We have ascertained that a tract of land was left to several persons by name,
and that provision was made that it should belong to the survivor; therefore,
whoever he may be, he can transmit the ownership to his heir, and he will not
be bound by the terms of any trust of this kind.
Published on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of
Chilo and Libo, 205.
3. The Same Emperors to &lia.
If Pontionilla has arrived at the age when she is entitled to receive the
legacy or trust bequeathed to her, she can transmit to her heirs the right to
demand the same even before she has actually acquired the said legacy or trust.
Published on the fifth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Chilo
and Libo, 205.
4. The Same Emperors to Ammia.
When the usufruct of land is bequeathed to a wife, and the ownership of the
same when she shall have children, she will be entitled to the ownership of the
property as soon as a child is born, and it makes no difference if the latter
should immediately die.
Published during the Kalendsof August, during the third Consulate of Antoninus
and Geta, 209.
5. The Emperor Alexander to Maximus.
An uncertain condition is not imposed upon either a trust or a legacy by the
following words, "I do give and bequeath to my daughter, JEliaSeverina, and to
Secunda, ten aurei,which she should accept as a legacy when she attains her
majority," but only the right to demand the legacy or trust is granted when the
girl becomes of age. Therefore, if ^Elia Severina, the daughter of the
testator, to whom the legacy was left, died upon the day when it became due,
she transmit-
ted the right to recover it to her heir, provided that payment is made at the
time when Severina would have reached the twenty-fifth year of her age, if she
had not died; for it has been decided by persons learned in the law that not
the beginning of the year, but the end of the same, must be taken into
consideration, where the benefit arising from a trust, which has been
bequeathed, is concerned.
Published on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Alexander, Consul for the second time, and Marcellus, 311.
6. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian and the Csesars to Eusebius.
If a trust should be left by an intestate to your sister under the terms of a
codicil, and, after the day for the vesting of the trust arrived, she should
die in ignorance that such a trust had been bequeathed, you cannot pretend not
to be aware that she was entitled to an action of this kind, of course, after
the deduction by the heirs of the fourth portion of the estate of the deceased.
Published on the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of the above-named
Emperors.
TITLE LIV.
WHEN SECURITY SHOULD BE FURNISHED TO PROVIDE FOR THE PLACING OF LEGATEES OR
BENEFICIARIES OF A TRUST IN POSSESSION OF WHAT HAS BEEN BEQUEATHED TO THEM.
1. The Divine Antoninus Pius to Salvius.
If the claimant demands nothing more than that security should be given him
that the trust will be executed, the judge who has jurisdiction ought not to
decide whether or not the trust is due, but only compel security to be
furnished.
Without date or designation of Consulate.
2. The Divine Marcus to Stratonica.
We have learned, by experience, that it is conducive to the public welfare for
security which has been furnished for the purpose of protecting the last wills
of deceased persons with reference to legacies and trusts to be dispensed with
in compliance with the wishes of the testator. Hence, hereafter, in accordance
with the will of the deceased, the bond usually required in the case of a
legacy or a trust need not be exacted.
3. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Symphorus.
If, after you are placed in possession of a legacy or a trust for the purpose
of preserving it, the property has been either encumbered by pledge, or sold by
the heir, it is clear that your case will be entitled
to the preference, for the property is, as it were, pledged to you under
praetorian law.
4. The Emperor Antoninus to Protagoras.
If, as you allege, Arthemidora has become the heir of the father of your wards,
the latter will have no right of action against the debtors of the estate,
although a demand may be made that the estate held in trust be restored to them
after the death of the heir. It is clear that they can apply to the judge to
compel Arthemidora to furnish sufficient security for the execution of the
trust, provided the testator did not forbid this to be done.
Published on the third of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Laetus,
Consul for the second time, and Cerealis, 216.
5. The Emperor Alexander to Paulina.
Those who are placed in possession of a legacy or a trust do not acquire the
ownership of the property, but only the right of pledge. A competent judge,
however, will, upon your application, and after you have received the pledge,
see that the wishes of the deceased are carried out.
Published on the third of the Idesof August, during the Consulate of Julianus,
Consul for the second time, and Crispinus, 225.
6. The Same to Donatus.
That rule of law is well established by which he to whom security has not been
given for the preservation of a legacy or a trust, even to the extent of
encumbering the private property of the heir, can be placed in possession of
the property of the estate, even if it has been fraudulently removed, when the
heir does not furnish security within six months from the time when the demand
can be made in accordance with the Constitution of My Father, the Divine
Antoninus.
Published on the sixth of the Idesof January, during the Consulate of Fuscus,
Consul for the second time, and Dexter, 226.
7. The Same to Proculianus.
You should know that the Divine Marcus and Commodus decided that security for a
trust or a legacy can be dispensed with, but security can not be dispensed
with, even by a will, which guarantees that the person to whom the usufruct of
property had been left will use and enjoy it as a good citizen should do.
Published on the tenth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Fuscus
and Dexter, 226.
8. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Cassars, to Zenodorus.
It is certain that an action for damages can be brought against those persons,
or their successors, who should have taken security in the capacity of
magistrates administering the affairs of a municipality, but failed to do so,
as required by their duty, in order to provide
for the delivery of property left conditionally to the said municipality under
the terms of the trust, to the extent that the public was interested in having
such security furnished.

Caesars.
TITLE LV.
CONCERNING PROPER HEIRS, AND LEGITIMATE CHILDREN
AND GRANDCHILDREN, BORN OF A DAUGHTER, WHO ARE
ENTITLED TO AN ESTATE AS HEIRS AT LAW.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Crispina.
If you can become the legal heir of your brother, you will not be excluded from
obtaining his estate, on account of the provision that demand for the same
shall be made within a hundred days.
Published on the third of the Nonesof November, during the second Consulate of
Antoninus and Geta, 206.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Avia.
Grandchildren, who are the issue of different brothers, do not succeed to the
estate of their grandfather, who died intestate, equally, but per stirpes.
Ordered at Adrianople, on the third of the Kalendsof March, during the
Consulate of Diocletian, Consul for the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for
the third time, 209.
3. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Frontonus.
It is clearly provided by the Law of the Twelve Tables that the son, and the
grandson of another son, who died intestate, succeed equally, if they are under
paternal control.
This rule also applies to the praetorian law.
Ordered on the fifth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors.
4. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Marcella.
It is perfectly evident that, in accordance with the order of succession
prescribed by the Law of the Twelve Tables, where a man dies intestate, his
posthumous child should be preferred to his own sister.
Ordered on the sixth of the Idesof December, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors.
5. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Appianus.
If your father, under whose control you were, formally gave you in adoption,
you can succeed to the estate of your adoptive father, who died intestate,
along with his own children born before or after your adoption.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of the Caesars.
6. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Posidonius.
A child born of a freeborn woman and a slave is considered illegitimate, and
cannot claim to be the son of a decurion, even though his natural father may
have been manumitted, and have obtained the restitution of his birth.
Published on the sixth of the Idesof February, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
7. The Same Emperors and Csesars to ^miliana.
Afreedman, just as one who is freeborn, is not forbidden to have his son under
his control, since he is not, on account of his former condition, prohibited
from contracting marriage and having children.
Ordered on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
8. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Catonia.
Your daughter became the heir of her father, who died in the hands of the
enemy, in which instance proof of his death is not required, and she can
transmit the estate to you.
Ordered at Nicomedia, on the twelfth of the Kalendsof December, during the
Consulate of the Csesars.
9. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Constantine,
Prastorian Prefect.
If a deceased person should leave children of either sex, or of any number, and
one of his daughters should die leaving children of either sex or any number,
the said grandchildren by the said daughter shall be entitled to two-thirds of
the share which the deceased daughter would have obtained with her brothers, if
she had survived her father; and the remaining third part shall go to the
brothers and sisters of the deceased; that is, to the sons and daughters of him
whose estate is in question, who are the maternal uncles and aunts of those
whose interests We are providing for by this law.
We decree, under the same equitable rule, that what We have decided with
reference to the estate of a maternal grandfather shall also apply to that of a
maternal or a paternal grandmother, unless the grandmother shall have, in just
and severe terms, excluded her grandchildren from her will, under circumstances
approved by the laws. If the grandmother or grandfather should die intestate,
We not only maintain unimpaired the rights which We have established as
belonging to the grandchildren, but if either of them, having grandchildren of
this kind, should die testate, and pass over their grandchildren, or disinherit
them, the same rule shall also apply, and the wills of their grandparents can
be attacked as unjust.
Where any of the daughters are entitled to actions to recover property, and
have the right to appear in court, We, in accordance with the equitable
provisions of Our law, concede to the grandchildren the same rights to complain
of the wills of their parents, on the ground of inofficiousness, as children
are entitled to.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof March, at Milan, during the Consulate of
Timasins a.nH Prnmntiio a«a
10. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Maximus, Prastorian Prefect.
When the succession to grandmothers is discussed after their death, it is not
necessary to inquire whether the father of the grandchildren has changed his
condition; for when inheritances of this kind are involved, the personal status
of the children is only considered with reference to the property of him who
has the right of paternal control.
Given at Ravenna, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof October, during the
Consulate of Theodosius, Consul for the thirteenth time, and Valentinian,
Consul for the third time, 420.
11. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to the Senate of the City of Rome.
If a son or a daughter should die during the lifetime of their mother and leave
children, the latter will, by operation of law, succeed to their father or
mother without restriction. We decree that this rule shall unquestionably be
observed in the case of grandchildren.
Given on the Idesof November, during the Consulate of Theodosius, Consul for
the fifteenth time, and Valentinian, Consul for the third time, 420.
12. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Prsetorian Prefect.
Whenever a man or a woman dies intestate, leaving grandchildren or great-
children of either sex, or other descendants, not entitled to the possession of
the estate as children, and in addition to them, collateral agnates, the said
agnates shall not be allowed to claim for themselves the fourth part of the
estate of the deceased, but the descendants alone shall be called to his or her
succession.
We decree that this law shall be observed with reference to future questions,
but shall not apply to such matters as have already occurred.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Our
Lord Justinian, Consul for the second time, 528.
Extract from Novel 118, Chapter I. Latin Text.
With reference to the succession of the deceased head of a family, or that of a
son under paternal control, his children, if there are any, shall be preferred
to all others. Those of the first degree shall succeed equally per
capita;grandchildren, and others more removed, per stirpes,without distinction
of sex, or consideration of the right of paternal control, but only their
natural condition shall be taken into account.
TITLE LVI. ON THE TERTULLIAN DECREE OP THE SENATE.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Viviana.
Although children do not succeed as heirs to their mothers, who die intestate,
unless they are able to speak, still, there is no doubt that
mothers can succeed to their children, even if the latter should perish in
infancy.
Published on the tenth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of
Tyberianus and Dio, 291.
2. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Resa.
In determining the succession of a common son or daughter who died without
leaving children, brothers, or sisters, the father, who manumitted him or her,
shall be preferred to the mother, because he is still in the enjoyment of his
ancient right.
Ordered on the sixth of the Idesof December, during the Consulate of the
Csesars, 293.
3. The Emperor Constantius to Catulinus, Proconsul of Africa.
It is certain that mothers who have lost their children after the latter
arrived at puberty should not be excluded from the succession to their estates
by an exception on the ground that they did not demand guardians for them
before they reached that age.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of
Constantius, Consul for the seventh time, and Constans, 354.
4. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Eutro-pius, Prastorian
Prefect.
If a woman, without manifesting due respect for her deceased husband, by whom
she had no children, should marry too soon, she will be branded with infamy
under the well-known law enacted for this purpose, unless this stigma is
removed from her by the clemency of the Emperor. When, however, she has either
sons or daughters, and has obtained permission to marry, We consent that she
shall not be rendered infamous, nor shall she be liable to the other penalties
prescribed, provided that she transfers to her son or daughter, or sons and
daughters, half of the entire property that she had at the time of her second
marriage, the said transfer having been made with all the legal formalities,
and not even the usufruct of said property retained.
And if one of the said children, where there were two or more sons and
daughters, to whom the property was given, should die intestate, We decree that
his or her half shall belong to his or her surviving brothers or sisters. But
if all the said children should die intestate, all the property shall revert to
their mother as a consolation for her misfortune, so that she herself shall
again be entitled to half of what she gave to her sons or daughters, who died
intestate, from the estate of the last son or daughter who died.
Published on the fifteenth of the Kalends ofJanuary, during the Consulate of
Gratian, Consul for the fifth time, and Theodosius, 380.
5. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to the Senate.
A mother who, either under the will or as heir at law, succeeds her son or
daughter dying without issue, and does not contract a second marriage after the
death of her child, will acquire absolutely every-
thing left by the said son or daughter either by will or ab intestato.If,
however, she should choose to marry again, she shall be entitled to any
property obtained by her son or her daughter from other sources, but she shall
only have a right to the usufruct of the property of the estate of the deceased
father on the ground of humanity, and the ownership of the same shall pass to
the sisters and brothers of the
latter.
Given at Ravenna, on the fifth of the Idesof November, during the Consulate of
Theodosius, Consul for the twelfth time, and Valentinian, Consul for the
seventh time, 246.
6. The Same Emperors to Florentius, Prastorian Prefect.
If a mother, having undertaken the legal guardianship of her children, should
contract a second marriage in violation of the oath which she took, before
having another guardian appointed for her son, and rendering an account to the
said guardian of the amount due for the time that she administered the
guardianship, We decree that she shall be excluded from all the estate of her
husband, whether he died intestate or whether she was appointed a substitute
for her son in case he should die under the age of puberty.
Given on the seventh of the Idesof July, during the Consulate of Theodosius,
Consul for the sixteenth time, and Festus, 439.
7. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Prastorian Prefect.
If a man or a woman should die intestate, leaving a mother and a brother
whether by the same father or not, the mother shall not be excluded from the
succession of the son, but will be entitled to the estate along with the
brother of the defunct man or woman, if he is living, or his son or step-son if
he is dead, just as in the case of sisters of the deceased.
When, however, only sisters, who are agnates or cognates, and the mother of the
deceased man or woman survive, the mother, in accordance with the tenor of the
ancient laws, shall be entitled to one-half of the estate, and all the sisters
to the other half. But when the mother and the brother, or several brothers
alone, or sisters with them survive, and the man or woman dies intestate, his
or her estate shall be distributed per capita,and the mother shall not be
permitted to claim for herself a larger amount than the pro ratashare of the
per capitademands, under the pretext that the sisters of the deceased are
living; and, on the other hand, where an uncle of the deceased person, together
with his son or grandson are living, they shall have no right to the estate of
the deceased, if the mother, who is the heir, is still alive, for her share
cannot be diminished either by the ancient laws, or the more recently enacted
Imperial Constitutions.
(1) Where, however, the deceased person left not only a mother and brothers and
sisters who survived him, but a father as well, and died while his own master,
for the reason that the intervention of the father is understood to dispose of
the rights of the mother, We, actuated by humane intentions, and desiring to
provide for all, so hereby
order that the brothers and sisters of the deceased person shall be called
together to the succession of his or her estate, that the father and mother
shall conjointly be entitled to the usufruct of half of the entire property,
which shall be equally divided between them; and that the brothers and sisters
shall have the remaining half of the usufruct of the same.
But where the deceased died while under paternal control, the father shall
retain the usufruct, which he enjoyed during the lifetime of his son,
unimpaired as long as he lives; and the mother with the brothers of the
deceased shall be called to the ownership of his estate, because she could not
hold the said usufruct during the lifetime of the father, he having a right to
all of it; so that, if only sisters were living, she could take half the
estate, and in case there were only brothers, or both brothers and sisters, she
would, in accordance with the above-mentioned distribution, be entitled to a
proportionate share with them; it being understood that everything which has
been promulgated with reference to women contracting second marriages shall
remain unaltered.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of Our
Lord Justinian, Consul for the second time, 528.

Children are not allowed to exclude their parents by their wills, unless one of
the just causes of disinheritance enumerated in the New Constitution under No.

Extract from Novel 118, Chapter II. Latin Text.
Where a son dies without issue, but leaving ascendants alone as his heirs, they
succeed in the prescribed order of degrees. If they are equal in degree, they
succeed to equal shares of the estate, those on the father's side being
entitled to half, and those on the mother's side being entitled to the other
half of the property, even though their number may be unequal.
When, however, brothers and sisters are left, with ascendants, as heirs by the
deceased, they shall be called to the succession with the ascendants in the
next degree, so that the shares may be equal, all distinction of sex and
parental control being disregarded, where no mention is made of a second
marriage.
TITLE LVII. ON THE ORPHITIAN DECREE OF THE SENATE,
1. The Emperor Alexander to Evangelus.
When a woman dies intestate, leaving brothers or sisters, as well as a mother
and daughter, her estate shall, by virtue of the Orphitian Decree of the
Senate, belong to her daughter alone.
Published on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of
Fuscus, Consul for the second time, and Dexter, 226.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Metrodora.
The estate of a deceased mother is not divided in proportion to the number of
heirs surviving at the time of her death, but according to the number of those
entitled to the succession, and therefore, if your mother died leaving you and
your brother, who have been emancipated, and two other children, who were still
under paternal control, and the latter died before claiming their share of your
mother's estate, there is no doubt that you and your brother will each be
entitled to half of
the same.
Ordered on the seventh of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
3. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Juliana.
A daughter who acts in the capacity of heir can, in accordance with the
Orphitian Decree of the Senate, succeed to her mother, who died intestate,
without demanding praetorian possession of the estate.
Ordered on the twelfth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
4. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian and Theodosius to Httari-anus, Prefect of
the City.
Whenever a discussion with reference to the succession of an emancipated son or
daughter arises, the inheritance shall pass intact and entirely to the children
left by him or her, nor shall either the father or mother, under such
circumstances, be granted any right to the succession of their child who died
intestate.
Given at Milan, on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate
of Merobaudus, Consul for the second time, and Sa-turninus.
5. The Emperor Justinian to Demosthenes, Pr&torian Prefect.
Where a woman of illustrious birth has a son born in lawful wedlock, and
another one who is illegitimate, and whose father is uncertain, a doubt arose
to what extent they would be entitled to their mother's estate, and whether it
would only descend to legitimate chiU dren, or whether it would also go to
those who are bastards.1 Therefore, We order that, while any legitimate
children are living, no

portion whatever of their estates shall pass from mothers of illustrious birth
to their bastard offspring, either by will, on the ground of intestacy, or by
donations inter vivos;for the preservation of chastity
stigma attaching to it in subsequent times. The marriage of the parents, no
matter how long after the birth of the child it occurred, had the effect of
rendering the latter legitimate, in which respect it is materially different
from the rule of the Common Law, by which birth during lawful wedlock was
indispensable. At Rome a "natural" son did not originally signify a bastard,
but actual issue, in contradistinction to an adopted child. The acceptance of
Christianity had much to do with the popular odium visited upon innocent beings
for the sins of their parents, a prejudice unknown to, and, of course,
unrecognized by the legislators of antiquity, some of whom no doubt were
themselves vulgo qusesiti,or "naturales."
Children were called spurii,or "spurious," whose parents, being within the
prohibited degrees, were not permitted to marry, or who were the offspring of
harlots.
The Canon Law prescribes the legitimation of children by the subsequent
marriage of their parents, as follows: "Tanta est vis matrimonii vt qui antes
sunt geniti, post contractual matrinnonium, legitimi, habeantur." (Corpus Juris
Ca-nonici, Decret. Greg.IV, XVII, VI.) The indulgence extended by the Church to
its adherents, by rendering the effect of marriage retroactive in the case of
children already born, is largely traceable to the desire to protect its own
ministers, most of whom lived in open concubinage without reproach. This
regulation was established by Constantine, and especially applied to the issue
of concubines.
The legal incapacity of bastards to inherit was very early recognized in
England. "Orta est quasstio, si quis, antequam pater matrem suam desponsaverit
fuerit genitus vel natus utrum talis filius sit legitimus hseres cum postea
matrem suam desponsaverit. Et quidem licet secundum canones & Leges Romanus
talis filius sit legitimus hxres, tamen secundum jus & oonsuetudinem Regni
nulla modo tanquam hseres in hsereditate sustinetur vel hsereditatem de jure
Regni petere potest."(Glanvil, De Legibus & Consuetudinis Regni Anglise,VII,
15.)
Bracton says on this subject with reference to the legitimation of bastards:
"Sequitur videre qualiter illegittimi legittimantur; et seiendum, quod si quis
naturales habiierit filios de aliqua & postea cum eadem contraxerit, filij iam
nati, per matrimonium subsequens, legittimantur, et ad omnes actus legitimos
idonei reputantur, sed tamen non nisi ad ea que pertinet ad facere dotium; ad
ea verb quse pertinent ad regnum, non sunt legittimi, nee hseredes iudicantur,
quod parentibus succedere possunt, propter eonsuetudinem regni, que se habet in
contrariwm." (De Legibus & Consuetudinis Anglise,II, 63.)
At Common Law, an illegitimate child was filius nullius,and had practically no
civil rights. He could neither inherit nor transmit property. He could not be
christened, and hence received no legal name; if he died intestate, his
property might be appropriated by the Church. The performance of no filial
duties could be exacted of him, nor did any parental obligations in his behalf
exist. He was committed to the care of his mother, in accordance with the maxim
Partus sequitur ventrem.
The present laws which require support of a bastard child by its putative
father have been the source of manifold extortion and injustice wherever Anglo-
Saxon jurisprudence prevails.
Anyone born out of wedlock in England always remains illegitimate, unless his
status is changed by an Act of Parliament, which resembles restitutio
natalium,or the restoration of original rights of the Civil Law.
The laws of Wales compelled the father to support his illegitimate offspring,
even if the mother was a prostitute. "If an abandoned female become pregnant,
he who is the cause of it must provide for the child; for the law enacts that
she must not suffer loss on account of the connexion, though it has produced
such results." (Ancient Laws of Cambria, Laws of Howel the Good, II, Page 134.)
is the first duty of freeborn and illustrious women, and We hold that it would
be unjust, and very oppressive and unworthy of the spirit of our age, for
bastards to be acknowledged.
The parentage of a bastard could be repudiated by the observation of certain
formalities, in case the alleged father was accused. "There are three denials
of illegitimate children: the personal oath of the father, if he be living; if
the father be dead, the oath of the chief of the tribe, and of seven men of the
tribe with him, are necessary to receive or disown such a child; and if there
be no chief of the tribe, the oath of fifty men of the tribe are requisite to
disown such a child; and the illegitimate child who is disowned is considered
as a bondman and a slave unto the fourth of his descendants, or until he obtain
liberty by the ninth in descent." (Ibid.,Triads of Dyvnwal Moelmud, No. 118.)
The Code of Louisiana divides illegitimate children into several classes: those
whose parents might legally have married at the time of their conception; those
who were barred from doing so; adulterous bastards, one or both of whose
parents were married; and incestuous bastards, the result of intercourse
between relatives within the forbidden degrees of relationship.
Parents of illegitimate children are obliged to contribute to their support
where the latter have been legally acknowledged by either of them.
The only method of legitimation authorized by law is by subsequent marriage,
accompanying or following public acknowledgment of paternity. Even deceased
children, who have left issue, may thus be placed in the enjoyment of all civil
rights. (Civil Code of Louisiana, Arts. 200, 201, 202, 217, 218, 258.)
In the United States, as well as in England, when a wife is cohabiting with her
husband the presumption of legitimacy can only be overthrown by the most
conclusive and overwhelming evidence; and the law discourages all
investigations of this kind, except where the facts are notorious and can be
established beyond all reasonable doubt.
In many States of the Union, legitimation through marriage is provided for by
statute; and in some, failure to support the child is a felony, a condition
which affords unlimited and profitable opportunities for the sinister
operations of the blackmailer.
Scottish law which, like the Roman, legitimates a child born out of wedlock by
the subsequent marriage of its parents, formerly, by a legal fiction,
considered that the retroactive effect of the ceremony extended back to the
time when the child was begotten, thereby seriously affecting the rights of
legitimate children born in the meantime. This rule is no longer in force, but
leaves the rights of such children to be determined by the courts. (Erskine,
Principles of the Law of Scotland, I, VII, 37.)
The ancient custom of Normandy permitted the legitimation of bastards by
marriage. "Ceulx qui furent engendrez devant le manage, se le pere espouse
depuis la mene, Us sont tenus legitimes."
An illegitimate child enjoyed no right of inheritance, and could have no heirs,
except those by his wife. He might, however, purchase property, and hold it by
that title. "Bastard ne peut etre heritier d'aulcun heritage, mais par achapt
ou par autre condition le peut il bien avoir. Aulcun ne peut estre hoir a
bastard, que les enfantz qu'il a de sa femme esponsee." (Nouveau Coutunier de
France [NormandielChap. XXVII.)
The rule that the subsequent marriage of the parents, either accompanied or
preceded by the formal recognition of the child, establishes its legitimacy,
has been adopted by the nations whose jurisprudence is directly derived from
Roman sources. (Code Civil de France,Arts. 331, 332, 333, Code Civil de
Belgique,Arts. 331, 332, 333, 334, Codigo Civil de Espana,Arts. 120, 121, 122,
Codigo Civil Portu-guez,Arts. 119, 120, 121, Codice Civile del Regna
d'ltalia,Arts. 194, 195, 196, Allgemeines Burgerlich.es Gesetzbuch
[Austria]161, 162, Burgerlijk Wetboek, [Holland!327, 328, 329.)
The Swiss Code declares that legitimation takes place at once, by operation of
law, as soon as the parents of the child are married. They are bound to
acknowl-
We have, in accordance with reason, devoted this law to the encouragement of
modesty, which We think should always be observed. If, however, the woman was a
concubine of free condition, and had a son or a daughter by a freeman under a
connection recognized by law, he or she will also, along with the legitimate
children, be entitled to a share of their mother's estate, which she had
possession of as her law-
edge it before a civil magistrate either before or immediately after the
betrothal; but neglect to do so does not, in the slightest degree, affect the
validity of the act by which legitimacy is acquired. (Schweizerische
Zivilgesetzbuch,Arts. 258, 259.)
The law of Japan recognizes two kinds of illegitimate children, those who have
been acknowledged by the father, and those who have not.
The term indicating the former, like the filii naturalesof the Romans, was
originally employed to designate the offspring of concubines. In the matter of
inheritance, an acknowledged illegitimate child is only entitled to half as
much of the estate of its deceased parent as one born in lawful wedlock.
Recognition is accomplished by giving notice before the proper public official,
or by will. An unborn child may be thus recognized, but, when this is done, the
acquiescence of the mother must be obtained. If the child has attained its
majority, his or her consent must be given to render the proceeding legal.
While recognition is retroactive from the time of birth, this is not allowed to
prejudice the rights of others in any way. An illegitimate child may, either in
person, or by its lineal descendants or legal representatives, demand
recognition from either of its parents; and when this is once given it cannot,
under any circumstances, ever be revoked. In case of the marriage of the
parents, the child obtains all the rights of legitimacy from the date of its
acknowledgment. (Civil Code of Japan, Arts. 827-836.)
The term "bastard," among the Hebrews, was not generally applicable to the
offspring of illicit intercourse, but indicated a child born to persons within
the prohibited degrees of kindred, and especially the issue of a Jew and a
pagan, who was forbidden by the Scriptures from being present at, or
participating in, the religious ceremonies of the people. "A bastard shall not
enter into the congregation of the Lord; even to his tenth generation shall he
not enter into the congregation of the Lord." (Deuteronomy XXIII, 2.)
A law introduced by Solon provided that children not born in legal marriage
which could only take place between citizens who were freewere incapacitated
from inheriting any of their father's estate. This law was repealed, and
subsequently re-enacted; all whose mothers were not citizens were pronounced
illegitimate; and a Vo0os, or bastard, was defined to be "One born of a
stranger or a harlot." The original prohibition of inheritance does not seem to
have been renewed. "Let one of spurious birth, whether male or female, inherit
either in sacred or civil things." (Potter, Antiquities of Greece, Vol. I,
Pages 55, 179.)
Under Moslem Law, as under that of England, a child born out of wedlock cannot
be subsequently legitimated by the marriage of its parents. In order to be
legitimate it must be conceived after marriage. A bastard has no claim upon his
father, nor can the latter, even if he recognizes him, interfere with him even
for his advantage, or direct his education. (Hughes, Dictionary of Islam, Title
"Bas-.tard," "Legitimacy," Pages 39, 293.)
The ancient Anglo-Saxons classed all persons as illegitimate who had no claim
to be included in the "maegth,"or clan whose members were united by the tie of
consanguinity arising from legal marriage. Bastards were not susceptible of
legitimation, and the issue of an illegal matrimonial union belonged to the
same category, and enjoyed no family privileges. (Barrell, An Outline of Anglo-
Saxon Law, Page 61.)
As an almost universal rule, the jurisprudence of European nations forbids a
mother from stating in court who is the father of her illegitimate child. This
provision, while in some instances it may be productive of injustice, is
undoubtedly a potent safeguard against the fraud and rapacity of unprincipled
persons.ED.

6. The Same to Julian, Prsetorian Prefect.
A certain woman bequeathed freedom to a female slave in trust, and while the
trustee charged with granting her her liberty was in default in doing so, the
said female slave had a child. All the ancient legal authorities held that the
boy or girl born after the default had taken place was free, but a doubt arose
among them whether, if the mother should die, the child could succeed to her
estate. Therefore We, intending to remove this doubt,, do not permit it to
continue any longer, and order that, by virtue of the Orphitian Decree of the
Senate having reference to the preservation of offspring, the said child can
become the heir at law of its mother, if she should die intestate; and that the
mother, as well as her child, shall, under the provisions of both the
Tertullian and Orphitian Decrees of the Senate, be entitled reciprocally to the
inheritance of one another's estates.

of Lampadius and Orestes.
TITLE LVIII. CONCERNING HEIRS AT LAW.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Cassius and Hermiona.
It is a positive rule of law, both with reference to intestate successions, as
well as praetorian possessions of estates, that brothers and sisters enjoy
equal rights, through the bond of consanguinity, to which rights they were
entitled on the ground of being the next of km (even though they were not born
of the same mother); and this rule does not cease to be applicable because you
assert that your paternal aunts have been endowed by your grandfather.
Published on the Nonesof May, during the Consulate of Maximus, Consul for the
second time, and JElianus, 224.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Tatiana and Others.
If you did not acquire for your father the estate of him who appointed you his
heirs, and your father having subsequently died, you accepted the succession of
the deceased, after having rejected your father's estate; the Governor of the
province will not fail to see that the property of the deceased is separated
from that which belonged to your father.
Published on the sixth of the Idesof April, during the Consulate of Gordian and
A viola, 240.
3. The Emperor Decius to Asclepiodota.
It is a well-established principle of law that females can be admitted to
intestate estates by the right of consanguinity. Hence, as
the estate of your brother, who died intestate, belongs to you by the right of
consanguinity, the sons of another of your brothers have no ground for claiming
said estate; for, without taking into consideration the right of agnation, with
reference to all who are interested, the estate will go to you by the terms of
the praetorian law, because you are in the second degree, rather than to the
sons of your brother, who are only in the third degree.
Published on the second of the Nonesof December, during the Consulate of Decius
and Gratus, 251.
Extract from Novel 127, Chapter I. Latin Text.
Where there are no heirs in the descending line, the brothers and only sister
of the ancestor shall first be called to the succession, along with the sons of
a brother previously dead, per stirpes.I refer to a brother, and the children
of a brother descended from the same parents, whose estate is now in question,
which persons are entitled to the succession, even if there are no ascendants
of the deceased, and together with those nearest in degree, if there are any.
And even if the son of the aforesaid brother is in the third degree, he shall
be preferred to the brothers of the deceased, who are only related through one
parent.
In a succession of this kind all distinctions of sex and emancipation shall be
disregarded.
Extract from Novel 118, Chapter III. Latin Text.
After brothers born of the same parents, and their children, brothers and
sisters on one side are admitted along with the children of those who may have
already died. The children of these brothers, however, as they inherit (along
with the brothers of the deceased), are undoubtedly to be preferred to the
paternal uncles, and other similar relatives of the defunct.
In a succession of this kind, all distinctions of sex and agnation shall be
disregarded.
Extract from Novel 118, Chapter HI. Latin Text.
After sons or brothers, those next in degree are called to the succession, so
that when there are several in the same degree they will be admitted together,
all distinction of males and females being abolished; for in cases of this
description relationship alone is taken into account, and a division of the
estate shall be made per capita,and not per stirpes.
4. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximum and the Csesars to Csecilius.
If the grandson of your paternal uncle failed to make a will, or did so before
he reached the age of fourteen years, his estate will pass to you by the right
of agnation, and you can obtain it as heir at law, without having recourse to
the demand for praetorian possession.
Published on the Idesof July, during the Consulate of Diocletian, Consul for
the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third time, 290.
5. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Cupilla.
It is certain that persons entitled to an intestate succession by the right of
agnation are to be preferred to those who claim it under the right of proximity
of degree.
Published on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
6. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Claudiana.
When anyone dies without leaving proper heirs, or where they refrain from
accepting the estate, or reject it, a brother can succeed to the same by the
right of consanguinity.
Published on the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the above-mentioned
Emperors.
7. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Amianus.
An intestate succession is not equally transmitted to a paternal uncle and a
paternal aunt, although they both belong to the third degree, but the brother
of the father is, by the right of agnation, preferred to the sister of the
mother.
Ordered on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
8. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Syllanus.
If the estate has been entered upon by those whose succession is in question,
and who died while in the hands of the enemy, and this has been done by the
right of agnation, in accordance with the privilege of the Cornelian Law, or
you have succeeded after praetorian possession has been demanded, you will not
be prevented from claiming the estate.
Ordered on the Nonesof July, during the Consulate of the abovementioned
Emperors.
9. The Same Emperors and Cassars to Demagora.
There is no doubt whatever that, in the case of an intestate succession, a
sister is entitled to the preference over a grandmother or a maternal
grandfather.
Ordered at Nicomedia on the sixth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate
of the Csesars.
10. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Florentius, Prss-torian Prefect.
Those who are called to the succession of a deceased minor are hereby notified
that if his father is no longer living, they cannot, for a year, legally demand
that a guardian be appointed for him; and if the minor should die before
reaching puberty, they will have no right to his estate either on the ground of
intestacy, or under the rule of
substitution.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifth of the Idesof July, during the Consulate
of Theodosius, Consul for the seventeenth time, and Festus, 439.
11. The Emperor Anastasius to Constantine, Praetorian Prefect.
If he who, in accordance with Our Constitution, has applied for a rescript to
enable him to emancipate his children, in order that the son or daughter who is
to be emancipated may not, on that account, have his or her legal rights
extinguished, these same rights shall be preserved for the emancipated son or
daughter as against all other persons connected with them in this way, as well
as against others, so far as inheritances, successions, guardianships, or any
other matters whatsoever are concerned.
Contribution, however, shall be made them in accordance with the laws passed in
connection with emancipated persons, whenever a case of this kind arises,
inasmuch as emancipation has taken place.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Probus
and Avienus Junior, 503.
12. The Emperor Justinian to John, Praetorian Prefect.
We have been asked by the Bar of Csesarea, if a woman over fifty years of age
should have a child, whether it could succeed to its father, and We decree
that, although a birth of this kind is extraordinary and rarely occurs, still,
nothing which is known to be produced by Nature should be rejected, but every
right granted to children by any law whatsoever must be observed unimpaired and
unchanged for the benefit of such sons and daughters, with reference to all
successions, whether they are granted by will, or proceed from intestacy. And,
upon the whole, they are not dissimilar from others whom Nature causes to
resemble one another, and, especially, as by a former law of Ours We permitted
marriage to take place between persons of this description, not admitting that
they should be considered improper.
Given at Constantinople, on the ninth of the Kalendsof November, under the
fifth Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 532.
13. The Same Emperors to John, Praetorian Prefect.
A doubt has arisen with reference to emancipated children who have obtained
this advantage from their parents under an Imperial Rescript.
(1) As the Anastasian Law is known to protect brothers in their legal rights,
when any one of them died intestate and without issue, the question arose
whether his succession would pass to his brother or sister, or to his father
who survived him. We think that this doubt should be disposed of by a
comprehensive opinion, and therefore We order that, as in the case of the
property of mothers and of other persons, concerning whom the law has already
been laid down by Us, an estate of this kind can entirely pass to brothers or
sisters by the right of ownership, but that the entire usufruct of the same
shall be acquired by the father, whether he had had but one wife, or had
contracted a second marriage, and whether the emancipation was effected by
means of an Imperial Rescript, or the brothers were released from paternal
control by any other legal method.
(2) For as the father enjoys the usufruct, and his desire is that his estate
shall go to his children, the interests of the brothers are consulted in this
respect by the Anastasian Law, under another head; and now, in the present
instance, We grant them further relief, so that the father may have the
usufruct, and the brothers and sisters the ownership of the property which was
bequeathed, with the exception of the maternal estate to which, if they are all
brothers and sisters by the same mother, they alone shall be entitled. If,
however, this should not be the fact, then, as in the case of other property,
the ownership of the estate shall be shared by all of them equally, in order
that the procedure may, under all circumstances be perfectly clear, and that
there may be no doubt growing out of any distinction of persons or property.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof November, after the fifth Consulate
of Lampadius and Orestes, 532.
14. The Same to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
The interests of the human race were well provided for by the Law of the Twelve
Tables, which declared that no distinction should exist between legitimate male
and female children, and that this rule should be observed as well with
reference to their inheritance, as in the case of the children themselves, no
difference being allowed in their succession, as Nature gave them the same body
in order that it might remain immortal through the changes it underwent, and
that one of them might require the aid of the other, so that, if one was
removed, the other would cease to exist.
Posterity, however, established too subtle a distinction, and made an unjust
discrimination between the sexes, as Julius Paulus plainly stated in the
beginning of his book, which he wrote on the Tertullian Decree of the Senate.
For it is proper that daughters should succeed to the intestate succession of
their parents in the same way as their brothers; and, again, sisters can claim
for themselves the same privilege by the right of consanguinity; but should
their legitimate descendants, if they do not enjoy the privileges of
consanguinity, be excluded from legitimate succession when they have the same
right to it as males? Why is the sister of the father not called to the
succession of the son of her brother along with the male heirs, but one rule is
observed with reference to aunts, and another where uncles are concerned? Or
with what reason is the son of a brother called to the succession of his uncle,
and his sister excluded from it? Therefore We think that, in this respect, the
ancient law should be preferred to the recent one, and We decree that all
legitimate relatives, that is to say, those who are descended through the
masculine sex, whether they are males or females, shall be legally called to
the rights of intestate succession in accordance with the privilege of their
degree, and that sisters shall not be excluded, because they are not subject to
the rule of consanguinity; for why should the claims of consanguinity remain
unquestioned in the male sex, and wherefore should We commit an offence against
Nature, and derogate from legitimate right? This
discrimination entails the greatest injury, and inflicts, as it were, a deep
wound upon many persons. For, as males are called to the succession of females
by the right of agnation, why should the estates of the latter be permitted to
go to them by law, and females not succeed to one another, or to males under
the same rule, but be punished for the sole reason that they were born women,
and their innocent offspring be afflicted with the defect caused by their
fathers, if it can be called a defect?
(1) In these instances, however, We, following the Law of the Twelve Tables,
and amending the new enactment by one still more recent, and induced by motives
of humanity, desire that there shall be but one degree, and that the succession
shall be transferred to the legal heirs by the right of cognation, without any
distinction of sex; so that not only the son and daughter of a brother (in
accordance with what We have already stated), shall be called to the succession
of their paternal uncle, but also sisters of the same blood, or the sons and
daughters alone of the sister by the same mother, but no other descendant
shall, together with the males, be entitled to the estate of their maternal
uncle; and, in case the latter should die, the paternal uncle shall become the
heir of children of his brother, and the maternal uncle of those of his sister,
thus succeeding in the same manner on both sides, just as if they did so by
legal right, that is to say, where the brother and sister are no longer living.
For when persons of this kind take precedence, and are entitled to the estate,
those of other degrees are entirely excluded.
It should undoubtedly be noted that the inheritance is not divided per
stirpes,but per capita,and that the rule of descent above mentioned applies to
intestate successions, the rules governing all others, and which have been
legally observed up to the present time, remaining unaltered. If, however, any
cases should occur to which the former laws are applicable, distribution must
be made in accordance with them.

Lampadius and Orestes, 532.
15. The Same to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
We remember the Constitution formerly promulgated by Us, by which, in
accordance with the Law of the Twelve Tables, We ordered that all lawful
descendants, whether males or females, should acquire an estate by the right of
descent, and that as the succession came to the former as heirs at law, the
latter also obtained it in the same manner.
By the above-mentioned Constitution, We established but one degree of lawful
succession, with reference to cognates, namely, that of the sons and daughters
of a full sister and of the sons and daughters of a half sister.
We decree that this Constitution shall remain in full force, as its tenor has
been set forth by Us in Our Institutes. But, for the purpose of rendering
legislation more perfect, We have deemed it necessary, in case anything
advantageous should be found in the prastorian law, to include it among Our
enactments.
(1) It is clear, therefore, that the Prsetor calls the emancipated son, without
any reservation, to the succession of his father, even though, strictly
speaking, he has undergone a change of status; but he was not, under the same
law, called by him to the succession of his brothers, nor did his sons, as
heirs at law, succeed to their paternal uncles. We have considered it necessary
to amend this, and to render the Anastasian Law perfect by making additions
thereto, so that an emancipated son and daughter shall not only succeed to the
estate of their father, as where they are proper heirs; but that they shall
also succeed to the estates of their brothers or sisters (whether they are all
proper heirs, or all emancipated, or include both these classes) equally and
reciprocally, and not with any difference of shares as provided by the
Anastasian Law.
It seems to Us perfectly proper to establish these regulations with reference
to emancipated children.
(2) We are not willing for an uterine brother or sister to be left among
cognates, for they are in such a near degree that it is only reasonable that
they should be called without any distinction, just as if they were of full
blood, along with their other brothers and sisters; so that they, being in the
second degree, and found worthy of legal succession, shall be preferred to all
others of a more remote degree, even though the latter may be heirs at law.
These rules with reference to the succession of persons of the second degree
have been established by Us as productive of the greatest convenience.
(3) When the third degree in the collateral line, in which the ancient laws
placed uncles and nephews is considered, We order that the sons and daughters
of an emancipated brother or sister alone, whether they themselves were
emancipated, or remained under the control of their parents, and no one else in
a more remote degree, as Well as the sons and daughters of a uterine brother
and of a full or uterine sister, shall only be called reciprocally, as being in
the legitimate line of descent; just as We have already decreed that all those
who, either by the ancient law, or by Our indulgence, have obtained the
privileges of heirs at law and who are likewise in the third degree shall be
called in the same way; and that the right of succession shall also be
preserved in this instance; so that if any one of those in the second degree
should reject the estate to which they were called, and fail to enter upon it,
and there is no one else in the second degree who can succeed, or is willing to
do so, then those who are in the third degree, and whom We have enumerated in
the present law, will succeed instead of the heirs who refuse to accept the
estate.
It should also be noted that the estate must be divided, not per stirpesbut per
capita,and that, in all other successions, the law which has been observed up
to the present time shall prevail, and no cognate of the degrees above
mentioned shall be classed as an agnate, but shall, in accordance with his
proximity of degree, retain his right of succession unimpaired.
(4) On the other hand, We impose the charge of guardianship upon those persons
whom We have transferred from the rank of cognates to that of agnates; that is
to say, if they are males and of full age, as provided by the terms of Our
Constitution, so that they may not only enjoy the benefits of their position,
but also be subjected to its responsibilities.
(5) If, however, any cases should arise which have already been settled by
judicial decisions, or amicable compromise, they shall not be liable to
reconsideration under this law.
Given at Constantinople, on the Idesof October, during the Consulate of Our
Lord the Emperor Justinian, Consul for the fourth time, and Paulinus, Consul
for the fifth time, 534.
TITLE LIX. MATTERS COMMON TO SUCCESSIONS.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Varania.
You should have known that, although your brother was emancipated, you who
remained in the family would not be entitled to the preference, so far as the
estate of your emancipated brother was concerned, but that both of you would
succeed if you had demanded Praetorian possession of the estate in accordance
with the forms of law.
Ordered on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
2. The Same Emperors and Caesars to Apollinarus.
If your own father, having become the heir of your cousin, who was your agnate
and died intestate, entered upon his estate by virtue of the Civil Law, or if
he did not intervene in the beginning, or was deprived of his right by a change
of status, but succeeded to him after having regularly obtained praetorian
possession, and you have acquired the estate of your father, you should appear
before the Governor of the province and bring suit against his guardian with
reference to the administration of the guardianship.
Given at Verona, on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate
of the above-mentioned Emperors.
3. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Ulpiana.
It is absolutely certain that a step-father is not, either by the Civil or the
praetorian law, entitled to the estate of his step-son, who died intestate.
Ordered on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
4. The Same Emperors and Cassars to Asterius.
A slave cannot have any successors.
Given on the Nonesof April, under the Consulate of the Caesars.
5. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Justina.
You do not lawfully demand, in your own name, the estate of your aunt whose
children have, as you allege, succeeded her; but, since you assert that the
said children died intestate, if those whom you say are the step-children of
your aunt should prove to be their blood-relatives, there is no doubt that the
brothers who, by the right of both cognation and agnation, are in the second
degree, should be preferred to you. If, however, the step-children of your aunt
were by another father, they are not the step-children of their mother, and, in
this case, you can claim their estates, if you can show that you have been
admitted to praetorian possession of the property.
Ordered on the twelfth of the Kalends ofMarch, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
6. The Same Emperors and Csssars to Publicianus.
It is a positive rule of law that an intestate succession should go to a
paternal uncle, who is in the third degree, rather than to a cousin who is in
the next degree following.
Published on the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
7. The Same Emperors and Csssars to Nicholas.No succession is permitted on the
ground of relationship by marriage.
Ordered on the Idesof October, during the Consulate of the Csesars.
8. The Same Emperors and Cseso.rs to Justa.
No one can, on the ground of intestacy, succeed to a person who has left a
will, before the appointed heir, who is legally capable and entitled to a share
of the estate, rejects it. Therefore, you will perceive that the estate of the
deceased cannot be legally claimed as long as there is any prospect of
testamentary succession.
Ordered on the sixth of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of the Caesars.
9. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Sopatrus.
The master of a female slave who has cohabited with a freeman cannot claim the
succession on the ground of this connection.
Ordered at Nicomedia, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the
Consulate of the Csesars.
10. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Danubius.
An estate cannot, either by the Civil or the Praetorian Law, pass to anyone on
the ground that he has supported the deceased.
Ordered on the sixth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
Extract from the Novel which Treats of Laws and Customs; Section Beginning,
"All Strangers," etc. Latin Text,
All foreigners and strangers shall be freely entertained wherever they desire;
and if, while this is being done, they should wish to make
their wills, they shall have free power to dispose of their estates, and the
disposition of the same shall remain undisputed. When they die intestate, their
host will not be entitled to anything, but their property shall be transmitted
to their heirs by the hands of the bishop of the diocese, if this can be done;
or it shall be devoted to pious uses. If a host should, in violation of this
Our Law, acquire anything from an estate of this kind, he must restore
threefold the amount to the bishop, by whom it shall be given to those whom he
considers worthy; notwithstanding any statute, custom, or privilege, which may
previously have provided for any other disposition of such estates up to this
time.
If any persons should presume to violate this Our Constitution, We hereby
deprive them of the power of disposing of their estates by will; otherwise,
they may be punished for the offence which they have committed, to the extent
that the nature of the offence demands punishment.
11. The Emperor Justinian to Demosthenes, Prietorian Prefect.
As in the case of property which is acquired by children through the marriage
of their fathers, the rule in cases of this kind being as follows, namely: if
one of the children should die, the share which he would have obtained shall go
to his children or grandchildren, and if there are none living, to his brothers
born of the same marriage, and when none of them survive, to the brothers born
of other marriages, and where none of them remain, it shall then go to the
father; so, We decree that the same order shall be preserved with reference to
property, which, for any reason, has come down through the maternal line, and
has either been disposed of by donations inter vivos,by last wills, or ab
intestato.
In the first place, the issue of a son or daughter shall be called to the
succession, and if none of these can be found, the brothers or sisters, born of
the same or another marriage, shall be called in the order previously
mentioned; and finally the father shall be called by the law, and the
unacceptable estate which was left by his son shall be acquired by him as a
melancholy source of profit.
In all the instances above referred to, where any issue of children survives,
and brothers have a right to claim the estate of the deceased in preference to
their father are still living, the usufruct of the property to the ownership of
which the sons are entitled shall belong to the parents of the latter.
Given at Chalcedon, on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof October, under the fifth
Consulate of Decius, 529.
Extract from Novel 84, Chapter I. Latin Text.
Hence, the father being dead, if the son should die intestate without issue,
but should leave brothers and sisters, some of full blood and others of half
blood, and others again born of both parents, he will transmit the estate to
those alone who are related on both sides.
TITLE LX.
CONCERNING THE ESTATES OF MOTHERS AND OF THOSE IN THE MATERNAL LINE.
1. The Emperor Constantine to the Consuls, Prsetors, Tribunes of Ihe People,
and the Senate, Greeting.
Property derived from the estate of a mother, either under the terms of a will,
or on the ground of intestacy, and which has gone to the children, will remain
under the control of the father, who shall have the right to the use and
enjoyment of the same during his lifetime, but the ownership shall belong to
the children. Fathers, however, to whom only the right of use and enjoyment of
the mother's estate is granted, must use all diligence for the preservation of
the same, and they must, either in their own proper persons or by an attorney,
demand what the children are legally entitled to and promptly pay all expenses
out of the crops, as well as defend any suits which may be brought, and act in
all respects so that the ownership may be acquired by the children perfectly
and indisputably, just as if they were transacting their own business; and if
they should attempt to dispose of any of their children's property, the
purchaser, or he to whom it is given, may take care not to either knowingly or
ignorantly accept any portion of the same which it is forbidden to alienate;
for the father should prove that what he either gives or sells is his own, and
the purchaser will be permitted to take a surety (if he desires to do so)
because he cannot plead any prescription against the children, whenever they
claim the property as their own.
Given at Aquileia, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof August, during the
Consulate of Sabinus and Rufinus, 316.
Extract from Novel 22, Chapter XXIII. Latin Text.The possessor becomes the
owner after the term of thirty years has elapsed, and the retention of property
for that period makes or constitutes the person who has received it the
proprietor of the same. This time begins to run against the children from the
day on which they become their own masters, unless some of them have not yet
attained the age of puberty.
2. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Florentius, Praetorian
Prefect.
Anything which a grandfather or a grandmother, a great-grandfather or a great-
grandmother, in the maternal line, have left to a grandson or granddaughter, a
great-grandson or a great-granddaughter by will, under a trust, as a legacy or
donation, or by any other title, or which may be acquired by intestate
succession, the father shall take charge of unchanged and unimpaired for the
benefit of his son or his daughter, as he cannot sell, donate, bequeath, or
encumber it to another, just as he cannot do with property of the mother's
estate, and he shall only be entitled to the usufruct of the same; so that he
loses all control over such property in case of his death, for his son or his
daughter will be entitled to it as a preferred legacy; nor can it be claimed by
those who are co-heirs only on one side.
Given on the Idesof October, during the Consulate of Olybrius and Probinus,
395.
3. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to the Senate of the City of Rome.
If the mother is living when her children are emancipated, and afterwards dies,
as the father is deprived of all benefit from the property, and does not even
retain the usufruct, We grant him shares of the usufruct, according to the
number of children, whether there is one, or more of them. Where, however, the
mother, when dying, left some of her children emancipated by their father, and
others still under his control, the husband will enjoy the unequal benefit of a
portion of the usufruct of the estate of the deceased. In this instance, We
make provision for both, that is to say, the father shall, by th,e authority of
the law, retain the usufruct of the shares of those who are still under his
control, and shall receive the price of the emancipation which was granted, if
he desires to do so. But of the shares of those who it is established were
released from paternal control during the lifetime of their mother, he will
only be entitled to the usufruct of a single share, in accordance with what has
already been provided.
With reference to grandsons and granddaughters, We decree that the following
rule shall be observed, namely: a husband, when his wife dies without leaving
any children, is called under this law to enjoy the benefit of the estate with
his grandsons and granddaughters alone; and if one or several grandchildren are
born to one or several sons who died while under paternal control, he or they
can enjoy the same right which has been provided in the case of children. For,
although the present law establishes this innovation, so far as grandchildren
are concerned, still, it is not reasonable that, under such circumstances, the
children should be in a worse condition than the grandchildren.
Therefore, let the grandfather, along with the grandchildren remaining under
his control, enjoy the usufruct of all the property constituting the estate of
the deceased grandmother. And when he bestows freedom upon them also by
emancipation, let him receive the price of manumission from them, just as has
been provided in the case of children; or, if he manumits some of them and
retains others under his control, let him enjoy the usufruct of the share of
those still subject to his authority, and withhold the lawful price from the
share of those who have been manumitted.
Where grandsons or granddaughters have been born to an emancipated son or
daughter, or liberated from paternal control by the former during the lifetime
of their grandmother, the said grandfather shall be entitled to the usufruct of
an equal share with them.
If, however, at the time when the grandsons or granddaughters are called to the
succession of their grandmother, some of them are under the control of their
grandfather, that is to say, of the husband
of the deceased, and some are independent, the above-mentioned rule shall be
observed with reference to such as are still subject to paternal authority,
both so far as the acquisition of the usufruct and the payment of the price of
emancipation are concerned, but those who are their own masters shall have the
power to enjoy the usufruct of a single share among them.
We order that these regulations shall apply to great-grandchildren of either
sex, the same rule which was promulgated with reference to them separately
remaining in force where there are both children and grandchildren.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof November, during the Consulate of Theodosius,
Consul for the thirteenth time, and Valentinian, Consul for the third time,
430.
4. The Emperor Leo to Cattistratus, Praetorian Prefect of Illyria.
For the purpose of disposing of all doubt and confusion, We order by this clear
and comprehensive law that there shall be no distinction with reference to the
usufruct of the estate of a mother, whether the father chooses to remain in the
former matrimonial condition under which he had children, or to give the latter
a step-mother, but the laws which have been enacted concerning the estates of
mothers shall remain firm and unshaken. Therefore, a father should undoubtedly
enjoy the usufruct of the mother's estate, even when he marries a second time;
nor will the children, or anyone else acting in their behalf, be permitted to
file improper accusations and complaints against their father.
Given on the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of An-themius, Consul
for the second time, 468.
TITLE LXI.
CONCERNING PROPERTY ACQUIRED BY CHILDREN WHILE UNDER THE CONTROL OF THEIR
FATHER, EITHER BY MARRIAGE OR IN ANY OTHER MANNER, AND ITS ADMINISTRATION.
1. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to the Senate of the City of Rome.
As Our sacred laws forbid fathers to acquire, under any title whatsoever, by
the right of paternal control, anything which a grandfather or a grandmother, a
great-grandfather or a great-grandmother in the maternal line, have left to
their children, it is proper to state that whatever a wife has given to her
husband, who is not emancipated, or a husband to his wife who is under paternal
control, by any title or right, or transmitted to him or her in any way, shall,
under no circumstances, be acquired by his or her father. Therefore, the
property will only legally belong to him to whom it has been conveyed.
Given at Ravenna, on the third of the Idesof November, during the Consulate of
Theodosius, Consul for the twelfth time, and Valen-tinian, Consul for the
second time, 426.
2. The Same Emperors to Hierius, Prsetorian Prefect.
For the purpose of rendering a clearer interpretation of a point in Our New
Constitution, We decree that whatever has been given by a husband or a wife, no
matter under what title, or transmitted by a last will through sons, grandsons
and great-grandsons, as well as daughters, granddaughters, and great-
granddaughters, cannot be acquired for their father, even though they are under
paternal control; but let no one think that this rule applies to what has been
bestowed by the parent himself, either by way of dowry, or as an antenuptial
donation, which was given in behalf of the persons above mentioned, so that it
may not, under any circumstances, return to him if opportunity should occur;
for care must be taken to prevent the generosity of parents towards their
children from being influenced by apprehension of this.
But, in order that the property of this kind may return to the father by law,
as well as the ownership of any other which may pass to the survivor from the
estate of a husband or wife, even though he or she may be under paternal
control, We decree that where the parent had only the right to the usufruct,
the ownership shall be reserved for him who is entitled to the same, from an
estate of either a wife or a husband; and that the father shall be entitled to
the price of emancipation on account of the benefit resulting from the latter,
if he should so desire, just as in the case of the estate of a mother, or where
property is obtained through the paternal line.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Felix and
Taurus, 428.
3. The Same Emperors to Florentinus, Prsetorian Prefect.
What is contained in former laws, namely, that an ante-nuptial donation shall
not be acquired by a daughter for the benefit of her father, if she is under
paternal control, nor a dowry be acquired by a son under the same conditions,
We confirm the above rule, and add thereto that where the said children, while
still subject to the authority of their father, die leaving issue, the said
property shall be transmitted to the children by virtue of the law of
inheritance, and not to their father by the right of peculium.Nor can property
be acquired in this way by a grandfather through his grandson.
If, however, a grandson, while both his father and his paternal grandfather are
both living, should die childless, the ownership of the property which came to
him from his mother, or through her line, shall belong, not to his grandfather,
but to his father, the usufruct of it, in cases of this kind, being reserved
for the grandfather as long as he lives.
Given at Constantinople, on the seventh of the Idesof September, during the
Consulate of Theodosius, Consul for the seventeenth time, and Festus, 439.
4. The Emperors Leo and Anthemius to Erythrius, Prsstorian Prefect.
The father, grandfather, or great-grandfather shall have, during life, the
usufruct of whatever property comes into the hands of a son, a daughter, or
grandchildren and great-grandchildren of both sexes, under paternal control,
who are the issue by the first, second, third, or any other marriage, which
property is derived from a dowry, a donation of any description, an estate, a
legacy, or a trust, and they are hereby absolutely prohibited from alienating
it in any way whatsoever, or encumbering it by either pledge or hypothecation;
and the ownership of the same shall belong to the children, grandchildren, or
great-grandchildren of both sexes, even when they are not the issue of the same
marriage from which the said property came into the hands of the parents of
those subject to paternal authority.
It should also be observed that the shares of brothers and sisters, the issue
of the same marriage, who have died, shall, in the first place, go to their
children, as has been already stated, when there are any, and if there should
be none, to the surviving brothers and sisters, or to the sole survivor, if
only one of said brothers and sisters remains alive.
Where, however, all who are the issue of the same marriage are dead, We then
decree that the said property shall go, share and share alike, to those born of
another marriage, and that where none of the above-mentioned persons have
survived, their parents shall be entitled to the property. The parents, under
whose control the children were, shall, however, only be entitled to the
usufruct, and We refuse them permission to alienate or encumber the said
property by the right of paternal control; but the said children, when they
become their own masters, are not forbidden to claim it in every legal manner ;
nor can any prescription of time be pleaded against them, unless it should
happen that, when they were liberated from their fathers' control, so long a
time had elapsed that their claim was barred by the continuous and undisputed
possession of the person holding the same. Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof
March, during the Consulate of Martian and Zeno, 469.
5. The Same Emperors to Nepotianus, Military Governor of Dal-matia.
The dispute which has arisen with reference to the affairs of the woman to whom
you refer, and her brother, is not unreasonable, and Your Excellency, having
cited different authorities on both sides, thinks that We should be consulted,
as the woman, relying upon different laws, is attempting to prove that the
words husband and betrothed mean the same thing, while her brother contends
that the name of husband is not applicable to one who has contracted a
marriage; he, basing his opinion upon the Constitution of the Divine Princes
Theodosius and Valentinian, Our predecessors, by which it is provided that
whatever a husband or a wife, while under paternal
control, may leave to one another, cannot be acquired by the father, but
legally belongs to him or her.
Therefore, although the term husband and wife are, according to their ordinary
signification, understood to apply only after the marriage has been celebrated,
on which point the doubt arose; still, because it is proper that ambiguous
questions which arise from different interpretations of legal enactments should
be decided liberally, and in accordance with natural law, We do not hesitate,
in the present instance, brought before us by Your Highness, to adopt the
opinion of the distinguished authority Julianus, renowned for his knowledge of
jurisprudence, and which is in conformity with justice; who, in a case
involving a dotal estate, decided that the same rule should be observed in the
case of a wife which applied to a woman who was betrothed (although the Lex
Juliaonly referred to a wife), for which reason We think that it would be a
more liberal construction to hold that the betrothal donation, as well as the
estate which the aforesaid betrothed man desired to bestow upon his intended
wife, shall not be acquired by her father, but shall belong to her
individually.
Given during the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of Leo, 471.
6. The Emperor Justinian to Demosthenes, Praetorian Prefect.
As it is necessary to provide for parents as well as children, in the
examination of the ancient law We have found that many things which are derived
from external sources by sons under paternal control should not be acquired by
their ascendants, just as is the case with anything derived from the estate of
a mother, or which they obtained as the result of marriage, so, We have
introduced certain regulations with reference to property which children under
paternal control obtain. Therefore, if a son, who is under the control of his
father, his grandfather, or his great-grandfather, should acquire property, not
from the estate of him under whose power he is, but which came into his hands
from any other source whatsoever, either through the generosity of fortune, or
as the result of his own labors, he shall not absolutely acquire it for the
benefit of his parents, as has hitherto been the law, but they shall be
entitled solely to the usufruct of said property; and the said usufruct shall
belong to the father, the grandfather, or the great-grandfather, under whose
control the dependent son may be; the ownership of the same, however, shall
remain in the son, just as in the case of property forming part of the estate
of the mother, and acquired by the son through the marriage.
Thus.no loss results to the father, as he enjoys the usufruct of the property,
and sons have no reason to complain that what they have obtained by their labor
has been transferred to others, either strangers or their brothers, which
appears to many to be even more deplorable.
Castrense peculiumis excepted from the operation of this rule, as the enjoyment
of its usufruct is forbidden by the ancient laws to the father, the
grandfather, or the great-grandfather.
We have introduced no innovation in these matters, but have preserved the
ancient regulations intact; and We have established the same rule with
reference to that species of peculiumwhich is acquired in the same way, and is
designated quasi castrense.
Extract from Novel 117, Chapter I. Latin Text.
Anything which is either given or left to children by any of their ascendants,
under the condition that their father shall not enjoy the usufruct of the same,
is hereby excepted from the above-mentioned rule.
Extract from Novel 118, Chapter II. Latin Text.
The same rule shall apply to the estate of a brother or sister to which the
survivor, along with his or her father, is admitted.
Extract from Novel 134, Chapter VII. Latin Text.
The same rule also applies to property to which children are entitled by law,
where their parents have ventured to dissolve their marriage without valid
reasons.
END OF THE EXTRACT.
THE TEXT OF THE CODE FOLLOWS.
(1) Under this head We place the following provision of the law, namely, that
with reference to the succession to property which is acquired from external
sources by sons under paternal control, the same rule shall be observed which
has been established concerning maternal estates and property obtained through
marriage.
(2) The sons of a family must not believe that the property of their father is
hypothecated by reason of the usufruct he enjoys, whether he be living or dead,
nor that they have any right to administer the same. The alienation or
hypothecation of such property is only refused to a father in his own name, but
he shall be entitled to complete control of it, and to use and enjoy whatever
has been acquired by his son in the manner aforesaid, and he shall have
absolute power over said property without liability to be called to account for
the same; and no son or daughter, or any of their descendants shall, under any
circumstances, dare to forbid him, to whose authority they are subject, to
retain possession of said property, or to administer it in any way which he may
desire, and if they should do so, the power of their father must be exerted
over them; but he, as well as the other persons above enumerated, shall have
full right to use, enjoy, and administer what has been acquired as aforesaid.
And if the father, grandfather, or great-grandfather should obtain anything by
the use of said property, he shall have permission to dispose of it in any way
that he may wish, and to transmit it to
his heirs; or if he should purchase, with the proceeds of the same, any
property which is movable or immovable, or which is capable of moving itself,
he shall be able to hold and transmit it in any way that he may decide, and
transfer the same to others, whether they be strangers, his own children, or
anyone else whosoever.
But when the father, having acquired property in the manner aforesaid, is
unwilling to retain the same, but bequeaths it to his son or daughter, or to
any of their descendants, the other heirs of the father, grandfather, or great-
grandfather shall not, after his death, be permitted to claim for themselves,
the said usufruct, or any of the proceeds thereof which may have come into the
hands of his son, as a debt due to his father.
He who enjoyed the usufruct to which his father was entitled shall be
considered to have received it as a daily donation from him, and hence he shall
be understood to have enjoyed the said usufruct after the death of his father,
and that the latter has transmitted the right to collect what was, as it were,
due to himself from his son who held the usufruct by his consent; and that he
did not transmit it to his posterity or his heirs, so that the latter may
remain in peace with one another, and no occasion for any dispute arise,
especially among brothers.
(3) As, however, it was provided by a law of the Emperor Constantine that, if a
son under paternal control had been released by emancipation, his father could
receive or reserve the third part of the property, the ownership of which he
was not permitted to acquire, by way of remuneration for emancipation, and, as
under this pretext, children were deprived of no small part of their
inheritance, We order that, when a case of,this kind occurs, and they obtain
their emancipation, their father shall not acquire the third part of the
ownership of the property, but only half of the usufruct shall remain with the
parent who grants the emancipation, except in the case of peculium castrenseand
quasi castrense,from which nothing shall be deducted on this account, in order
that children of either sex may not be deprived of the ownership of property,
and the usufruct of the greater portion of their estates be transferred to
their fathers.
This rule shall also apply even if, when the emancipation was made, the father
reserved nothing for himself, unless he expressly, either at that time,
renounced all claim to this compensation, or, when he made a donation, deprived
himself of this advantage, and transferred it to his children. The right and
benefit of retaining the usufruct shall remain in possession of those who enjoy
it, even if they are silent as to its disposition, and, after their death, the
usufruct in all the above-mentioned cases shall vest in those to whom the
ownership of the property belongs; although (as We have already stated) the
rules of succession, which have been established by Our laws published on this
subject, must be observed with reference to property derived from maternal
estates, and marriages.
(4) As, however, the ancient laws introduced tacit hypotheca-
tions in certain cases, and We found it necessary to introduce them also in
maternal and other donations, a doubt arose from what time the hypothecation
should be reckoned, whether from its origin or from the date when affairs were
badly administered, We, giving the law a liberal interpretation, do hereby
decree that to ascertain the date of abandonment the commencement of the
hypothecation should be considered, and not the time when the business began to
be badly conducted.
Read in the New Consistory of the Palace of Our Lord Justinian.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of Decius,
529.
1. The Same Emperors to Julianus, Prsetorian Prefect.
As many privileges relating to Imperial donations have already been granted, We
think that it is worthy of Our dignity to add still another to them. Hence, if
anyone, without distinction of sex, has received either from the Emperor or the
Empress a donation of movable or immovable property, or of such as is capable
of moving itself, We direct that, even where a son or a daughter under parental
control has acquired the absolute ownership of property of this kind, and has
not obtained the same for the benefit of anyone, then, neither his father,
grandfather, nor great-grandfather shall have the right to claim the usufruct
of it, but the sons or daughters under paternal control shall, as in the case
of castrense peculium,have complete ownership of said property. For, as
property derived from the Imperial Family is pre-eminent above other kinds, so
the generosity of princes must take precedence of that of
all others.
Given at Constantinople, on the twelfth of the Kalendsof April, during the
fifth Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
8. The Same Emperor to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
As, not only in the case of property obtained by a son from his mother's
estate, but also in all other cases in which the father is not entitled to
acquire it (and above all after the publication of Our new law relating to all
property acquired by sons under parental control from external sources, and not
from the estates of their fathers, the said law having provided that such
property shall not be acquired by the father but only the usufruct of the same)
; different controversies have arisen, and unforeseen events and discussions
have taken place, and as these matters are constantly being brought before the
courts, it becomes necessary to dispose of them all advantageously and clearly.
Therefore, with reference to all property of which the ownership cannot be
acquired by the father, but where he is entitled to only the usufruct of the
same, or where the ownership cannot be acquired by other ascendants from
children of either sex under parental control, or where a father compels his
son, subject to his authority, and who has attained his majority, to enter upon
an estate, and the latter thinks that he should reject it, or where the son
desires to accept it, and his father is of the contrary
opinion, he shall have full power to do so; and his father can accept the
estate for himself, if the son refuses, and he shall be responsible for all
loss and enjoy all the benefit, and the son shall not be, in any way,
prejudiced by his act.
If, on the other hand, the son should desire to enter upon an estate, and his
father should refuse to permit him to do so, the latter shall not be entitled
to the acquisition or usufruct of the same, but the son shall only have himself
to blame if any loss results from his act, and no suit shall be brought against
his father when his son, contrary to his wishes, desired to acquire an estate,
legacy, trust, or other property, under any title whatsoever, whether it be by
gift, or through the contract of another.
Nor, in like manner, shall any right of action be granted against the son when,
after his refusal, his father claims the property for himself by his own
authority; for, under the present law, by an acceptance of this kind, all
responsibility attaches to the father. The latter, however, shall have full
permission to bring all suits, and be defended by others, where he is entitled
to the sole benefit; and the son also shall have both the disadvantage and the
benefit in the institution and defence of actions, the father being required by
the judge to appear and consent, whether the son is acting as plaintiff or
defendant, in order that legal proceedings may not appear to have been
conducted without the acquiescence of the father.
This rule is also applicable where the son has attained his majority, and is no
longer obliged to comply with the wishes of his father.
(1) But if the son is still a minor, and his father refuses to permit him to
accept an estate left to him, or he himself claims it with the consent of his
father, just as in the case where the son refused to accept it, We, in like
manner, grant his father permission to enter upon the estate and to acquire
full right to the same, subject to all the regulations which We have mentioned
above.
If, however, the father should refuse to accept the estate, and the son desires
to accept it, We give him permission to do so. When the father is unwilling to
manage the property of his son on account of the exigencies of the case, the
son shall have power to appear before a competent judge, and ask him to appoint
a curator for the estate, to whom the administration may be committed; and, in
both instances, the son under paternal control shall, by no means, be refused
complete restitution.
(2) In like manner, where a son under paternal control belongs to the army, and
refuses to accept an estate acquired through his castrense peculium,,permission
is hereby granted his father to accept it in such a way that he will have full
right to the same, and shall possess it, not only so far as its usufruct is
concerned, but with reference to its ownership as well, just as if he himself
had been appointed heir in the beginning; he being, of course, liable for all
the charges of the estate, and entitled to all the benefits accruing therefrom,
without any responsibility whatever attaching to his son.
These rules shall also be observed in cases in which a difference of opinion
arises between the father and the son.
(3) Where, however, both agree, the father will receive the usufruct, and the
son the ownership of the property, no matter what the age of the son may be,
and the father must bring and defend all suits and thus take charge of all
litigation. The consent of the son ought always to be obtained, unless he is an
infant, or in a distant country, and the expenses must be paid by the father,
for the reason that he is entitled to the income of the property. For how would
it be possible for the son to meet the expenses of litigation growing out of
the property, when he is only entitled to the mere ownership of the same?
(4) But if the estate is encumbered by debts incurred by the deceased, as,
among the ancient authorities, the amount of an estate was understood to be
what was left after the indebtedness had been deducted, the father shall have
permission to sell a sufficient part of the property, in the name of his son,
in order that the debts may immediately be settled, and the estate not be
burdened with the payment of interest, the personal effects being first
disposed of, and if they should not be sufficient, the remainder of the
indebtedness to be discharged out of the real property.
If, however, the father should fail to do this, he himself will, by all means,
be compelled to pay the interest, either out of the income of the property, or
out of his own pocket. Where either legacies, trusts, annuities, or only one
sum is left as a charge upon persons of this kind, the father will be obliged
to pay the claims out of the income of the estate, if it is sufficient; but if
the estate does not yield sufficient revenue for the discharge of the legacies
or trusts, or does not yield any at all, or includes either real or personal
property which, although unproductive, is, nevertheless, valuable, as for
instance, houses situated in the provinces, or elsewhere, or suburban villas,
the proceeds of which would be sufficient for the payment of legacies of this
kind, the father shall be given permission to sell enough of them in the name
of his son to discharge the indebtedness.
It should undoubtedly be noted that the father himself, as usufructuary, is
obliged to support the slaves belonging to the estate, and to do everything
with reference to the usufruct which will, in no way, cause deterioration of
the property; but, on account of the respect to which he is entitled from his
children he will be excused from rendering accounts and furnishing security, as
well as from all the other requirements ordinarily imposed by the laws upon
usufructuaries, in accordance with the terms of Our Constitution which We have
promulgated concerning cases of this description.
(5) The father is also compelled to provide support for his sons or daughters,
and their descendants, not because he is in the enjoyment of the estate, but on
account of the demands of Nature and the laws which have ordered that children
must be maintained by their parents, as well as parents by their children, if
either of them should be reduced to poverty.
The father, however, shall, only in the cases previously mentioned, be legally
permitted to sell the property of his son, in the name of the latter, or, if he
should be unable to find a purchaser, to encumber it, and, under no
circumstances, shall children be allowed to repudiate such sales or
hypothecations. Permission should not be granted to fathers to alienate, or
subject to pledge or hypothecation any property, the ownership of which belongs
to their children, except in the instances above referred to. If,
notwithstanding this warning, they should do this, they are hereby notified
that they will be liable to punishment under the laws by which sales or
hypothecations are prohibited; except, of course, where personal or real
property is burdensome to the estate or in some way injurious to it, and this
the father is authorized to sell with a view to the interests of his children,
and without himself incurring any liability, provided the price received is
placed with the other property of the estate, or employed for its benefit, or
preserved for the children.
Again, We do not allow sons under paternal control to dispose of property of
this kind by will, in cases in which the usufruct of the same is vested in
their ascendants during the lifetime of the latter; nor shall permission be
granted them to alienate the ownership of any property belonging to them, or to
hypothecate or pledge the same, against the consent of those to whose control
they were subject. For it is better to restrain the ardor of young persons, in
order to prevent them from suffering the unpleasant consequences, which,
through having yielded to their desires, await them after the dissipation of
their patrimony. For, as has already been stated, their parents being obliged
to support them in accordance with the laws and the dictates of Nature, why
then should they wish to hasten the sale of their property?
(6) Moreover, when the extreme youth of a child permits his father to accept
the estate in his name, even without his consent, and he does so, We grant
complete restitution to the child after he has been released from the control
of his father, or has grown up; and We, under all circumstances, impose all the
charges of the estate upon the father (even though he entered upon it in the
name of his son). Why should he have accepted such an estate, when neither he
himself, nor his son, who is now grown up, thinks this to be advantageous to
the latter? We do not, however, grant the son permission in case he demands
complete restitution if he, while still a minor, thought that the estate should
be rejectedto accept the estate aforesaid a second time after restitution,
lest the laws may become a mockery if he should frequently be allowed to accept
and reject the same inheritance.
But when he did not ratify the act of his father, and obtained restitution on
this ground, why should he be allowed to adopt a course which, contrary to the
decision of his father, he thought should have been rejected? If, however, the
father refused the estate while his son was in infancy, and the latter
subsequently being still under his father's control, or after he had been
released from
it, should think that the said estate ought to be accepted, We grant him
permission, if he is his own master, to enter upon it by his guardians or
curators, without any liability attaching to his father on account of the
refusal of the latter. In like manner, on the other hand, permission shall not
be granted either him or his guardians or curators, to demand complete
restitution in opposition to his former
decision.
These regulations are applicable to legacies and trusts which have been left in
specific as well as in general terms, and they shall also apply to the other
cases, which We have previously enumerated, in the same manner as to these.
Moreover, with reference to slaves who have been donated to children of either
sex (whether they were under paternal control or not) either during marriage,
by strangers, or under the condition that they would immediately grant them
their freedom, no impediment shall be interposed by paternal authority; for
what usufruct can be acquired by the father which can only exist for a moment?
If it is necessary for him to possess the slave and grant him his liberty at
the same instant, how can he acquire the usufruct of him under such
circumstances?
TITLE LXII.
CONCERNING THE ESTATES OF DECURIONS, MASTERS OF SHIPS, ATTENDANTS OF MILITARY
COHORTS, AND EMPLOYEES IN ARSENALS.
1. The Emperor Constantius to Mastichianus, Prefect of Subsistence.
We decree that if the master of a ship dies intestate, and without leaving
children or other heirs, his estate shall not go to the Treasury, but to the
association of shipmasters from which he was taken by death.
Published on the fifth of the Kalendsof . . . , during the Consulate of
Constantius, Consul for the seventh time, and the Caesar Constantius, 354.
2. The Same Emperor to Bonosus, General of Cavalry.
It is your duty to notify the legions, as well as all other bodies of troops,
that, if any individual member of them should die intestate, without leaving
lawful heirs, his estate shall absolutely belong to the corps in which he
served.
Given at Hieropolis, on the fifth of the Idesof May, during the Consulate of
Rufinus and Eusebius, 347.
3. The Same Emperor to Rufimis, Praetorian Prefect.
When anyone attached to a cohort dies intestate and without leaving heirs, We
order that his estate shall belong, not to the Treasury, but to other members
of the corps in the same province.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of Limenius
and Catulinus, 349.
4. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Florentine, Praetorian Prefect.
We direct that the property of decurions who die intestate and without heirs
shall be acquired by the other decurions of the same province.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Florentius and
Dionysius, 429.
5. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Aurelian, Count of Private Affairs.
When any workman employed in the arsenals dies intestate, without leaving any
children, or legal heirs, We order that his estate, no matter what the amount
of it may be, shall belong to those who are, as it were, the creditors of
deceased persons, and are required to be responsible to the Treasury for their
dead comrades. The result of this is that no loss will be sustained by the
State, and the workmen, who are held liable for all losses and injuries, will
enjoy the property of their defunct colleagues.

BOOK VII.


TITLE I.
CONCERNING FREEDOM GRANTED BY THE WAND
OP THE PRAETOR, AND MANUMISSION CONFERRED
IN THE COUNCIL.

1. The Emperor Antoninus to Tertius.
The condition of those who are manumitted in the Council, after the ground for
it has been approved by the court, and the manumission has taken place, is not
usually called in question, even when it is alleged that enfranchisement was
obtained by false representations.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Sallust.
It is perfectly certain that where Roman citizenship has once been granted, a
second manumission can neither add anything to, nor take anything from it.
Given on the day before the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors.
3. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Attonita.There is no doubt that a woman
cannot legally manumit anyone either through her husband, or an agent, by means
of a wand.1
4. The Emperors Constantius to Maximus, Prsetorian Prefect.
A slave can obtain his freedom through the efforts of his patron in the
presence of Our Council, or before consuls, praters, presidents, governors, or
municipal magistrates, to whom this right has been conceded.
TITLE II. CONCERNING TESTAMENTARY MANUMISSION.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Primus.
It is certain that if anyone over twenty years of age should make a codicil,
leaving a slave his freedom, the date of confirmation will not prejudice the
manumission; for, in this instance, the intention of the deceased, and not his
legal capacity, must be considered.
2. The Same Emperors to Philetus.
Freedom cannot be granted by the will of a deceased person when the estate has
not been entered upon, or if the disposition of the property was set aside,
because of some crime which was not punished on account of death.
3. The Same Emperors to Euphrosinus.
Where freedom has been granted by the will of the deceased and the estate has
been entered upon, even though the appointed heir may have rejected it for the
purpose of obtaining complete restitution, this will, nevertheless, in no
respect interfere with the grant of freedom.
Ordered on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Aper
and Maximus, 208.
1 Manumission by vindicia,or festuca,a wand, or staff, ordinarily took place
before the Praetor, but could be effected by any other magistrate legally
authorized to grant it. The master brought the slave, whom he wished to
liberate, before the proper officialan act which might be performed anywhere,
and did not, by any means, imply appearance before a judicial tribunaland
after having stated the reason for his emancipation, gave utterance to the
formula: "Hunc hominem liberum esse volo more quiritium,"whereupon the
magistrate placed the wand upon his head; he was then turned around either by
the lictor or his master, and the latter, after having given him a box on the
ear, sent him away.
Classic writers are greatly at variance in their accounts of this species of
manumission, which, of high antiquity, was probably changed in its order and
details from time to time. The use of the staff, and the box on the ear,
symbolical of the final castigation which could be inflicted upon the slave,
corresponds with the accolade of knighthood, indicative of the last blow which
the candidate could, consistently with his honor, tolerate.ED.
4. The Same Emperors to Archelaus.
Although your father obtained his freedom directly by will, and you were his
heir, still, you cannot be compelled to render accounts of any business which
he transacted while he remained in slavery, as he did not receive his freedom
upon that condition. Again, he to whom freedom has been bequeathed either
directly or under the terms of a trust, on condition that he would render his
accounts, cannot obtain his freedom before having submitted them and returned
any property which he may have abstracted with evil intent. If, however, having
rendered his accounts, he should not be found to be indebted to the estate, he
will obtain his freedom absolutely after the estate has been entered on.
Published on the Kalendsof December, during the second Consulate of Lsetus, and
Cerealis, 216.
5. The Emperor Alexander to Quintilicm.
A testamentary grant of freedom made for the purpose of defrauding creditors,
even though the heir of the debtor may be solvent, is not valid under the Lex
JElia Sentia.
6. The Emperor Gordian to Pisistratus.
If the estate of him, by whose will you say you were manumitted, has been
rejected by the heirs on account of its indebtedness, you do not unjustly
demand that the will of the testator shall be observed with reference to you,
for the purpose of protecting the interests of freedom, if you offer to satisfy
the creditors of the estate; especially as this has already been decreed by
that most learned Emperor, the Divine Marcus.
This rule shall also be observed in the case of strangers.
7. The Same Emperor to Justa.
You should not, against the wishes of your mother, bestow freedom upon a slave
whom she forbade to be liberated, lest you may appear to have violated the
rights of filial affection.
8. The Emperor Philip and the C&sar Philip to Tremellius.
When a testator has ordered that freedom shall be granted to a certain slave,
at the time of the marriage of his son or daughter, he did not definitely fix
the date of his liberation from servitude, but he merely made it conditional,
so that if the marriage did not take place, freedom could not legally be
demanded by the slave.
9. The Emperors Cams, Carinus, and Numeriamis to Maurus.
The deceased could not directly bestow freedom upon your slave, although it is
stated that he appointed you his heir; for no one can, in accordance with law,
grant freedom directly to the slaves of others.
10. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian and the Caesars to Germans.
When freedom is legally granted in direct terms to slaves, not only by the
imposition of the cap of liberty,1 but also by acceptance of the estate, such
slaves become freedmen under the wills of their masters if no legal impediment
exists.
11. The Same Emperors and Csssars to Laurina.
If a will is void in law, any grants of freedom bestowed under it will not be
considered properly made, even if, as you allege, it was not added that the
instrument should be valid as a codicil.
12. The Same Emperors and Csssars to Rhysus.
If the heirs appointed under a will, which was legally executed, enter upon the
estate with the usual formalities, you cannot be deprived of the freedom to
which you were entitled under said will, if the appointed heirs, acting in
collusion with those who claim the estate on the ground of intestacy, should
refuse to accept it. Where, however, they voluntarily reject the estate left to
them, everything included in the will is considered to be of no effect.
If, however, the Governor of the province should ascertain that the heirs are
in collusion for the purpose of defrauding you of your freedom, he will provide
for your obtaining it, in accordance with the Constitution promulgated by the
Divine Pius Antoninus.
13. The Same Emperors and Csssars to Martial.
It is certain that where freedom has been left to a slave conditionally, he
cannot be deprived of it by the heir, nor can either alienation or usucaption
injure a slave who is to be conditionally free, as long as he will be entitled
to his liberty if the condition is complied with.
14. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Florentine, Prse-torian Prefect.
Direct grants of freedom can be made by wills drawn up in the Greek language,
so that such grants, when made directly, shall be considered of the same force
as if the testator had ordered them to be stated in the terms prescribed by
law.
1 The pileus,or Phrygian cap, made of felt, with the top fashioned to represent
the circumcised phallus, and adopted by the Romans as the symbol of liberty,
has survived to the present daya singular and instructive memento of the
association, in ancient times, of the worship of the generative principles with
the exercise of the priceless right of freedom. It was worn by the
Carthaginians as well as the Romans, and is now a conspicuous portion of the
attire of the Tunisian Jewess. The peasantry of many nations of Europe have
retained it through all the vicissitudes and revolutions of centuries; and its
phellic appendage, conspicuously displayed on the coinage of the United States,
is delineated with a remarkable accuracy, which, although presumably
unconscious, leaves no doubt whatever as to its original significance.ED.
15. The Emperor Justinian to John, Praetorian Prefect.
As a Constitution of the Divine Marcus declares that where anyone either makes
a will or dies without doing so, thus furnishing ground for an intestate
succession, and bequeathes grants of freedom, and no one desires to accept the
estate of the deceased because there is reason to suspect it of being
insolvent, and the grants of freedom have been left under a trust, without
having been reduced to writing, any stranger whosoever, or any one of the
slaves to whom freedom has been left and whose status is in danger, can enter
upon the estate, on condition of giving security that he will satisfy all the
creditors, and confer freedom upon those whom the testator intended should
receive it.
Various doubts have arisen with reference to the interpretation of this
constitution, for if the property of the estate should be sold because no heir
could be found, it was asked whether, after the sale of the said property, it
would be possible for either a slave, or anyone else to accept the estate,
recover from the purchasers what had been sold, execute the grants of freedom,
and satisfy the creditors? Although the Divine Severus did not permit this to
be done after the property had once been disposed of, still We have adopted the
opinion of Ulpianus (especially with reference to the grants of freedom, in
order that they may not be lost) who held that, after the sale of the property,
a remedy would be afforded by the Constitution of the Divine Marcus within a
year; provided all the creditors were paid during that time, and the purchasers
suffered no other inconvenience by submitting to the rescission of the sale
before the aforesaid period had elapsed. Hence the slave who was entitled to
his liberty, or any stranger, will be permitted to enter upon the estate,
either before the sale or afterwards, within the term of a year, and recover
the property, having first furnished security that the grants of freedom will
be carried out, and the creditors satisfied.
(1) Moreover, if anyone, having entered upon an estate, should promise to carry
out all grants of freedom, and to pay the creditors not in full, but only in
part, and the latter accept this proposal, We decree that, in a case of this
kind, the Constitution of the Most Wise Emperor aforesaid shall be applicable,
and We hold that it should by all means be adopted, especially when the
creditors consent, but when they are unwilling, We do not permit any such
agreement to take effect.
(2) Where, however, some of the slaves are willing to accept freedom and others
think that it should be rejected, in this instance, the Rescript of the Divine
Marcus will apply, and there is no doubt that in this case the petitioner for
freedom should be heard, and the slaves have perfect liberty to decide whether
they prefer to be free or to remain in servitude. For while no slave is allowed
to refuse Roman citizenship, still, in this instance, lest through the
ingratitude of some the others may remain in bondage, all slaves who desire to
obtain their freedom shall be permitted to do so; and if any of them are
unwilling, or reject it, they shall be immediately reduced to servitude,
and those who would not accept a patron will obtain a master, and perhaps a
severe one.
(3) When, however, the person who accepts the estate does not promise to carry
out all the grants of freedom, but only to liberate a certain number of slaves
whose manumission was provided for, if the property of the estate is sufficient
for the payment of the creditors in full, the better course will be for all the
slaves to receive their freedom, even though this may not have been promised.
But when there are not enough assets to settle the claims of the creditors, it
is more advantageous for only a few of the slaves to be emancipated.
(4) In this way We have found a remedy for the doubts of the ancients, by
adding an excellent provision to the constitution aforesaid; and hence We order
that if no single claimant of the estate appears, but several do, and two or
more appear at the same time, all of them shall be given permission to enter on
the estate, all having previously furnished security that they will satisfy the
creditors, and carry out the grants of freedom.
But if they should appear at different times, the one who comes first shall
take precedence, if he can give security; but if he is unable to do so, the
others shall be entitled to the privilege in their order, according to the time
when they make the demand; and this must be done within a year.
(5) Where one of the applicants promises to free certain slaves, but not all,
and another is prepared to furnish security that all the creditors will be
satisfied, and all grants of freedom be carried into effect, it will be
perfectly just for the latter to be accepted, so that all the grants of freedom
without distinction may be executed. We grant this favor not only to a slave to
whom freedom was bequeathed, but also to him to whom it was not left by will;
so that the result may be commendable, and others receive their freedom by
means of one to whom it was not left by will.
(6) If, however, anyone should first receive the property of the estate and his
liberty, We decree that the preceding provision shall apply to the second or
the third claimant, or to any others who promise more generous donations of
freedom. But when the slave who was the first to demand the inheritance has
already received it, and freedom has been conferred by him upon certain other
slaves belonging to the estate, and some slave forming part of the same, or a
stranger who is free, appears and offers better terms, he shall be permitted to
take the estate, if he promises to do more, and gives proper security. The
first applicant shall, however, retain his freedom, even though the property
may have been sold by him, and all these things must take place within a year
from the time when the first claimant presented himself, in accordance with
what has already been stated.
TITLE III. CONCERNING THE ABOLITION OF THE LEX FUSIA CANINIA.
1. The Emperor Justinian to Henna, Praetorian Prefect.
We decree that where grants of freedom are left to slaves by will, whether this
is done directly, or under the terms of a trust, they shall be valid without
distinction, just as where freedom is bestowed by the acts of persons who are
living.
The Lex Fusia Caniniashall not apply to other cases, and no impediment shall be
placed in the way of testators who desire to exercise their beneficence by the
emancipation of their slaves.
TITLE IV. CONCERNING GRANTS OF FREEDOM BY MEANS OF TRUSTS.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Primus.
As you allege that the estate of the testator, by whom freedom was bequeathed
to you by the terms of a trust, was not entered upon, and another heir than the
one appointed obtained possession of the estate on the ground of intestacy, if
you do not demand the freedom which was granted you under the trust, with the
execution of which the heir 'at law was charged, you can not legally demand it
from him who was not requested by the testator to bestow it. It is clear that
if you can prove that the appointed heir neglected to give you your freedom,
after having received money for doing so, the heir at law can be compelled to
grant it to you.
Published on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of
Lateranus and Rufinus, 198.
2. The Emperor Antoninus to Valerius.
Although the codicil by which it appears that you were bequeathed to the uncle
of the deceased has been declared forged, still, if you obtained your freedom
from the legatee in a proper manner, before any question arose with reference
to the crime, what happened afterwards will not invalidate the grant of freedom
made in this way. According to the Constitution of the Divine Hadrian, it is
evident that the heir will have the right to demand the twenty aurei.
3. The Emperor Alexander to Lucius.
As you allege that freedom was conditionally granted to the female slaves, why
should there be any doubt that children who came into the world before this was
done were born slaves, and became the property of the heirs by the right of
ownership? For relief should only be granted to those who were born after he
who was charged with the grant of freedom was in default, in order that they
may appear to have been born free.
4. The Same Emperor to Julianus.
Where a female slave, to whom freedom was left under a trust by the will of her
master, has received her liberty, she, having become
a Roman citizen in accordance with the Decree of the Senate, and the
constitutions promulgated with reference thereto, her children will be
freeborn. If, however, she has never claimed her freedom, she should only blame
herself if the children born to her in the meantime are slaves.
5. The Same Emperors to Dionysius.
A minor of twenty years of age cannot, by his last will, bequeath freedom under
a trust to his slave, unless he is able to prove that he was legally authorized
to do so.
6. The Same Emperor to Maximus.
It has been decided that freedom granted under the terms of a trust should be
given to a female slave, nor will she be the less entitled to it, if, in the
meantime, her mistress was unwilling to sell her, provided she received nothing
from the will of the person who bequeathed the freedom, for the reason that she
might be liberated in the course of time, whenever an opportunity to purchase
the slave might arise.
7. The Same Emperor to Nicomedes.
Slaves, to whom freedom has been granted under a trust by the last will of the
testator, become the freedmen of those who have been charged with their
manumission.
Published on the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Fus-cus and Dexter,
226.
8. The Same Emperor to Eutyches.
As you state that freedom was granted you by a trust, on condition that the
widow of the testator agreed to it, even though she did not enter upon the
estate, and all of it, in consequence, passed to his son, if he manifests no
opposition, you can demand your freedom.
9. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus to Daphnis.
Even if a testator, when he appointed his slave the guardian of his children,
did not, at the same time, grant him his freedom, it will be considered that he
manumitted him under the terms of a trust, and that this was done for the sake
of liberty and in behalf of the wards. If he had appointed not his own slaves
but those belonging to another, being at the same time aware of his condition,
it was held by jurists that he likewise would be entitled to his freedom as
under a trust, unless it clearly appeared that the intention of the deceased
was otherwise.
10. The Same Emperors to Mercurialis.
You will still be entitled to the grant of freedom left you by the terms of the
trust, subject to the condition that you shall receive it when the testator's
son attained his twenty-fifth year, even though, as you allege, the heir should
have died before reaching the designated
age. For it was held by the ancients that the hope of freedom should not be
destroyed after the time had elapsed when, if the son of the testator had
lived, he would have attained the prescribed age.
11. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Flavianus.
If you were a slave, and freedom was bequeathed you under the terms of a trust,
you are hereby notified that you cannot obtain your liberty without
manumission. Hence if, while a slave, you obtained a fiduciary grant of
freedom, you must appear before the Governor of the province, so that, after
having investigated your case, he may decide whether or not you have the right
to be set free, and may compel him to manumit you, whose duty it is to do so;
or, if the latter conceals himself he can, by means of a decree, protect your
interests against the person who cannot be found.
12. The Same Emperors and Cassava to Hyrenius.
It is stated by legal authority that freedom under a trust shall not be
considered as bequeathed, on account of the insertion of the phrase, "I
recommend," into a will or codicil.
13. The Same Emperors and Consuls to Pythagorida.
If the testator, having before his marriage given you to his future wife,
afterwards left her a legacy, and by his will or codicil charged his heirs to
manumit you, there is no doubt that they, as well as she, by accepting the
legacy bequeathed to her, approved the will of the deceased, and will be
liable, and that you will be entitled to your freedom under the terms of the
trust.
14. The Emperor Justinian to Julianus, Prsetorian Prefect.
As a doubt arose among the ancients whether it was possible for freedom to be
left under the terms of a trust to a slave who was, as yet, unborn, and was
expected to be a boy, We, for the purpose of settling this dispute, order that,
in favor of freedom, both the grant of it under a trust, as well as one made
directly, shall be valid, whether the unborn child is male or female, as only
the question of freedom is considered, even if the mother who brought him forth
still remained in slavery.
If, however, several children of different sexes were born at the same time,
and only one or more were mentioned, all of them will be entitled to their
freedom as soon as they are born; as it is better, in case of doubt, to adopt
the more humane opinion, and especially where liberty is concerned.
Given on the Kalendsof October, during the fifth Consulate of Lampadius and
Orestes, 530.
15. The Same Emperor to Julianus, Prsetorian Prefect.
We decree that when freedom has been bequeathed to a male or female slave under
a trust, and the debtor is in default in granting it,
the slave shall be liberated from servitude by a decision of the Governor,
without any act of the heir, or without waiting for his consent. Such a slave
shall be entitled to his or her freedom, just as if he or she had obtained it
directly from the testator himself, as it is wicked as well as absurd for heirs
to delay to carry out the wishes of the testator, especially where liberty is
involved.
16. The Same Emperor to Julianus, Prsetorian Prefect.
If a testator, in his will, should charge his heir to grant freedom to any one
of the children of his female slave, whom he designated by name, and the said
slave brought forth one or more children, and the heir did not, during his
lifetime, grant freedom to any of them, or, while deliberating which one he
would set free, died; a doubt arose among the ancient authorities whether all,
one, or none of the said children would be entitled to be free.
We, desiring to punish the evil intention of the heir for not complying with
the wishes of the testator, and for not selecting one of the children of the
female slave and giving it its freedom when he was able to do so, do hereby
decree that not only he, but also his heirs and successors, shall be compelled
to liberate all the children of the said female slave; for this is not contrary
to the intention of the testator, since, when he provided that any of said
children whom the heir might select would be free, he did not have in mind any
certain one, but all of them; and if the heir did not comply with his wishes,
there is no doubt that, according to the intention of the testator, all of them
would be entitled to their freedom.
We order that the same rule shall apply when the testator charged not the heir,
but a legatee or beneficiary of a trust, with the grant of freedom, so that,
for this reason, heirs, legatees, or beneficiaries of trusts, being actuated by
a just fear, may carry out the will of the testator, and may not themselves
suffer loss by being compelled to liberate all the slaves.
Any complaints they make shall be to no purpose, for they can only blame
themselves for the loss which is not due to Our legislation, but is the result
of their own contumacy.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof December, during the
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
17. The Same Emperor to Julianus, Prsetorian Prefect.
Where anyone has bequeathed his slave under the condition that the legatee
should grant him his freedom, and the heir, acting dishonorably with reference
to the legacy, refused to surrender the slave to the legatee, and suit having
been brought against him, and the judge having ordered him not only to give up
the slave, but also to pay his appraised value, the ancient interpreters of the
law were in doubt whether an obstacle was not placed in the way of freedom by a
decision of this kind; and when it was decided that freedom must be granted,
whether this should be done by the heir or the legatee, and if the heir granted
it, whether the legatee would be entitled to retain
the amount which he had received as a pecuniary fine, either entirely,
partially, or not at all.
We, in disposing of this controversy, are surprised to learn that the judge,
who had jurisdiction of the case aforesaid, did not require the heir not to
surrender the slave but only to pay his value, as such a fault offers an
occasion for a dispute. Wherefore, if such a question should arise, We think
that no judge would be so foolish as to render a decision of this description.
If, however, the legatee should demand that the slave be delivered to him, and
the term of two months should elapse after issue had been joined in the case,
We decree that the slave shall immediately obtain his liberty and become free,
and that the heir, on account of his evil behaviour, shall be condemned to pay
four times the amount of court costs incurred by the legatee, and that the
right of patronage shall be preserved unimpaired for the benefit of the latter.
TITLE V.
CONCERNING THE ANNULMENT OF CONDITIONAL GRANTS OF FREEDOM.
1. The Same Emperor to Julianus, Prsetorian Prefect.
Those known as dediticiishall not hereafter, under any circumstances, be
permitted to interfere with the administration of Our government, for the
reason that We find this term has fallen into disuse, and that the freedom
obtained by the aforesaid class exists only in name; for We, who endeavor to
cultivate the truth, only desire those things to appear in Our laws which can
actually become operative.1
Given during the Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes.
1 There were three kinds of manumissions originally recognized by the Roman
polity: the testamentary, or that conferred by will; that by enrollment in the
census; and that obtained by means of the vindicia,in the exercise of
magisterial authority. All of these were accompanied with certain essential
formalities which, if omitted, prevented the peregrinus,or "foreigner," from
acquiring the full rights of citizenship, and rendered him liable to be
assigned to one of the two inferior classes of freedmen.
When the requirements of the law had been strictly complied with, the
emancipated slave was entitled to all the privileges of a Roman citizen,
subject, however, to the obligations of patronage due to his former master, or
the heir of the latter, in case he chose to enforce them.
The Latini Juniani,whose status was comparable to that of the allies of the
Romans, composed the second grade of liberti.Certain disabilities attached to
their civil condition, which might be removed, either by a repetition of the
act of manumission, with its prescribed requisites, by a former master, or by
the indulgence of the sovereign.
The lowest in rank of all freedmen were the dedititii,whose position was that
of prisoners of war (from whom their name was derived), who had surrendered
unconditionally, and therefore were considered to be at the absolute disposal
of their captors. Where a slave had been subjected to torture, branded,
imprisoned, chained, assigned to a school of gladiators, condemned to fight
with wild beasts
TITLE VI.
CONCERNING THE ABOLITION OF LATIN FREEDOM, AND
ITS TRANSFERENCE IN CERTAIN WAYS TO THE ENTIRE
BODY OF ROMAN CITIZENS.
1. The Emperor Justinian to John, Prtetorian Prefect.As the class of dedititian
freedmen, having already been abolished, the freedom of the Latins, for this
reason, becomes in some respects unstable, and though to a certain extent
identified with the former, whatever remained that was available We have
confirmed as law. For as Latin freedom, like that originally introduced into
the ancient Latin colonies, resulted only in civil war, it would be absurd for
its appearance to remain when the thing itself was abolished.
Therefore, as the condition of freedom was obtained by the Latins in almost
innumerable ways, and different laws and decrees of the Senate were enacted
with reference to the same, and in the application of these the greatest
difficulties arose from the Lex Junia,the Largian Decree of the Senate, and the
Edict of the Divine Trajan, of which Our laws are full, for they were
introduced before any experience had been acquired in matters of this kind.
Hence it appears to Us perfectly proper to remove all these difficulties,
abolish Latin freedom, and having selected other methods different from those
by which Latin freedom was formerly acquired, give authority, at the present
time, to such persons to obtain the status of Roman citizens, so that all the
rules enumerated in the present law, which have originated in Roman States, and
all the other ways by which the name of Latins was acquired shall be absolutely
abolished, and shall not create Latin citizens, but shall be considered void.
For who will tolerate a condition by which, at the time of his death, freedom
and slavery can exist at once in the same person, and that he who lived as free
may die in
servitude ?
(1) Therefore, We order that if anyone should desire to grant his slave freedom
by means of a letter he can do so, provided he signs it himself, in the
presence of five witnesses called together for that
in the arena, or been guilty of conduct which rendered him infamous, he was
debarred from Roman citizenship, even though properly manumitted, and became a
dedititius.This disqualification was permanent and irrevocable, but did not
affect his children, whose status was that of their father before his behavior
had rendered him the object of public censure. A servile violator of the law,
when emancipated, did not obtain his freedom, but, from being a private, became
at once
a public slave.
The dedititiuswas prohibited from making a testamentary disposition of his
estate, which by operation of law, at his death, vested in his patron. He could
not live within a hundred miles of Rome, a violation of this rule entailing his
re-enslavement, and the confiscation of his property.
Modification of the restrictions imposed upon libertiwere introduced by
different emperors, but it was reserved for Justinian to entirely abolish the
distinctions which characterized the various orders of persons liberated from
bondage, and to divide the Romans into only two classes, freemen and
slaves.ED.
purpose; or when the letter, written in his own hand, discloses the permanency
of his intention. If he, having either drawn up the instrument himself, or
having had it done by a notary, should state therein that his slave was
entitled to his freedom, as in the case of a codicil, he may, even during the
lifetime of his patron, enjoy liberty and the rights of Roman citizenship.
(2) When anyone desires to liberate his slave in the presence of friends, he
shall be permitted to do so in the same way that he could perform such an act
after having called together five witnesses, provided he announces that he
wishes his slave to be free, where this is done in writing, and attested by the
signatures of the witnesses, and the person granting the manumission; and if it
is made before a public official, it must also bear his signature as well as
that of the witnesses.
Slaves who obtain their freedom in this manner become Roman citizens, just as
if they had obtained it by virtue of a codicil.
(3) We know that, in ancient times, under an Edict of the Divine Claudius, if
anyone ejected his slave publicly from his house when he was suffering from a
dangerous illness, and did not aid him in any way, or commit him to the charge
of others when he himself was unable to take care of him, or place him in a
hospital, or provide for him in some other manner, the said slave would
formerly enjoy Latin freedom, and if his master should die before he did, he
would, with his property, belong to his successor.
A slave of this kind shall hereafter become absolutely free, even against the
consent of his master, and, having been given his property, he shall
immediately become a Roman citizen, nor shall any of the rights of patronage be
enjoyed by his former owner, for he who publicly drove him away from his house
and family, without either assisting him, recommending him to the mercy of
others, placing him in a hospital, or even paying him ordinary wages, shall be
deprived of the ownership of the said slave, not only during the entire
lifetime of the said freedman, but also at the time of his death, as well as
afterwards.
(4) In like manner, if anyone should alienate his female slave on condition
that she would not prostitute herself, and her new master, through the infamous
desire of gain, should attempt to compel her to do so, or if her former master
should, by the imposition of his hands, make a reservation for himself when
alienating her, and she having been returned to him, cause her to prostitute
herself, she will immediately obtain the privileges of a Roman citizen, and he
who prostituted her will be excluded from all the rights of patronage, for is
anyone so degenerate and wicked as to pursue such a calling worthy to have
either a female slave or a freedwoman?
(5) Slaves who have received the cap of liberty by virtue of the last will of
the testator, and the consent of the heir, immediately become Roman citizens,
and have the right to march first in the funeral procession, and to stand by
the bed on which the body of their master has been laid.
No one shall be permitted to make a display of vain liberality, so that the
people may praise the deceased for his humanity, when they see a great number
of such slaves in the funeral procession wearing the liberty cap, for they will
all be deceived, as the slaves remain in their former servile condition, and
the evidence given in public shall ggoofor naught. When any such slaves become
Roman citizens, the right to patronage is reserved unimpaired for the benefit
of their
patrons.
(6) It should undoubtedly be observed that, when anyone manumits a slave either
by his will or under the wand of the Praetor, although he may say or write that
he wishes the slave to enjoy Latin freedom, the superfluous addition of "Latin"
shall be abolished, and he shall become a Roman citizen, lest the methods by
which men were formerly invested with citizenship may seem to have been
annulled by the wills of private persons.
(7) But if anyone should bequeath freedom to his slave conditionally, and while
the condition was still pending, a foreign heir should grant him his freedom,
he will become a Roman citizen, and not a Latin one as in former times. When
the condition is not complied with, the slave shall remain the freedman of the
heir who liberated him.
If, however, the condition should be fulfilled, anyone manumitted by will shall
be considered a freedman of the deceased, in order that children and cognates
may not be deprived of the rights of patronage, and that he who was entitled to
those rights by law may enjoy
them.
(8) The opinion held by the ancients seems to Us to be very harsh, that is to
say, where a slave has been defeated by his master in a suit brought to declare
him free, and his value was afterwards paid by someone to his master, but he
still remained subject to Latin law; for how can it be reasonable for his
master to receive the price of the slave, and at the time of the death of the
latter, again reduce him to slavery, since these two things are not consistent?
In the present instance, the slave will be entitled to Roman freedom, but the
rights of patronage will continue to be enjoyed by his master, for the reason
that the slave himself is, to a certain extent, his freedman.
(9) Where, however, anyone gives his female slave in marriage to' a freeman,
and provides her with a dowry, which is only customary in the case of those who
are free, the said female slave becomes a Roman citizen, and not a Latin one.
But if this is done, which very frequently takes place among Roman citizens,
and especially where they are noble, that is to say, where a dotal instrument
is drawn up and delivered to a person of this kind, such an instrument will
necessarily take effect, and the slave will become a Roman citizen.
(10) In like manner, if a master in a public instrument refers to a certain
slave as his son, his statement must be believed so far as the free condition
of the former is concerned; for if he was inspired with such an affection for
his slave that he did not consider him unworthy to be mentioned as his son, and
he did not do this
secretly, or only among friends, but in a public document, just as he would
have done so in court, how can the slave again be reduced to servitude at the
time of his death? He must, however, become a Roman citizen, receive absolute
freedom, and not depend upon a false statement of his master.
(11) Again, the most recent manner of changing Latin into Roman citizenship
should be adopted, namely, the instrument by which the condition of the slave
was established shall either be given to him or destroyed. But in order that no
opportunity may be afforded to slaves to steal it, and obtain their freedom by
their own wicked act, this manner of enfranchisement must be proved by certain
and undoubted evidence, and the owner of the slave must either give the
instrument to his slave in the presence of not less than five witnesses, or
tear or destroy it in some other way. Hence, to enable the slave to acquire
Roman citizenship, We decree that one who obtains his freedom in this way
shall, in this instance, as well as in others, be subject to the rights of
patronage, except where We have expressly denied these rights to patrons.
(12) With the exception of these cases alone, which have been selected from the
entire body of ancient jurisprudence relating to Latin citizenship, all the
other methods enumerated either in the books of jurists, or in the Imperial
Constitutions, are absolutely abolished ; and slaves shall not become Latin
citizens by their means, but, as has already been stated, shall remain in their
former condition, and shall not be permitted to profit by this remedy.
And, in order that hereafter no enactment with reference to Latin freedom may
conflict with Our Laws, the Lex Juniais hereby repealed, the Largian Decree of
the Senate shall no longer be operative, and the Edict of the Divine Trajan,
which follows, shall be of no force or effect, and if any other law, or Decree
of the Senate, or even an Imperial Constitution should treat of Latin
manumission, it shall be void, so far as this subject is concerned, and notice
is hereby given that, instead of the three kinds of freedom which formerly
existed, and which were the cause of much ambiguity, but one direct method
shall prevail.
If any law or constitution should hereafter make mention of freedom, it shall
be understood to be that conferred by Roman citizenship, and not Latin freedom.
(13) Where, however, Latin freedmen are dead, and their property, as such, has
passed to those.entitled to the same, or if they are still living, no
innovations shall be made by the provisions of this law, but the title to the
property shall vest to the persons aforesaid, and shall remain firm and
indisputable.
The present constitution shall only be applicable to freedmen in the future.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof November, after the fifth Consulate
of Lampadius and Orestes.
TITLE VII.
CONCERNING THE MANUMISSION OF A SLAVE OWNED IN COMMON.
1. The Emperor Justinian to Julianus, Prxtorian Prefect.
With reference to slaves owned in common and their freedom, and whether the
share of the person who gave them liberty accrued to the other master, or not,
and especially among soldiers, when they grant freedom in this way, much doubt
arose among the ancient legal authorities ; and a constitution is cited in the
Commentary of Martian on the Constitutions of the Divine Severus, by whose
terms this Emperor imposed the necessity upon the heirs of a soldier to
purchase the share of the other joint-owner, and give the slave his freedom.
Another constitution, however, promulgated by the Emperors Severus and
Antoninus, has been found, by which one partner is generally required to sell
his share to the other.
When freedom is granted to a slave, even though no benefit may accrue from the
estate of the dead partner to the other, and the price is required to be fixed
by the decision of the Praetor in accordance with what Ulpian, in the Sixth
Book on Trusts, and Paulus in the Third Book on the same subject, say, where it
is stated that Sextus ^lius, one of the ancient jurists, also held that the
other partner could be compelled by the Praetor to sell his share, in order
that the slave might become free, this Marcellus also notes in his work on the
Digest of Julianus, and it is clear that he in his commentary on Julianus only
adopted the opinion of the latter.
(1) Hence, these matters having been found in the works of the ancient legal
authorities, We, desiring to dispose of all such disputes, do order that,
generally speaking, no distinction shall be made between slaves owned in common
by soldiers or private persons, but in the case of all slaves who are common
property, where anyone desires to give them lawful freedom, either while alive
or by his last will, he can do so, and the other joint-owner shall be required
to sell his share of the slave, whether this be half, a third, or any other
portion whatsoever.
When there are several joint-owners, and one of them desires to liberate the
slave, all the others shall be compelled to sell the shares which they have in
said slave to the one who wishes to manumit him, or to his heir, even though
the common slave himself may have been appointed the heir of his master, and he
only made the appointment immediately before his death, in order that he who
purchased the shares of the other joint-owners, or his heirs, might liberate
the slave.
(2) If, however, the joint-owner or joint-owners refuse to accept the price, We
give him permission to tender it through a public official, and having sealed
it, to deposit it in a temple, and thus be authorized to give the slave his
freedom, which he shall enjoy to the fullest extent, as well as the privilege
of Roman citizenship; and he shall have nothing to fear from the other joint-
owners, for they will
have no one to blame but themselves, if, when they were able to benefit by the
price of the slave, they refused to accept it.
(3) But in order that no doubt may arise with reference to the peculiumof the
slave, We decree that his peculiumshall be divided among all the joint-owners
in proportion to the ownership of each one in the slave; permission being
granted to him who, at the time of his death, liberated the slave, to transfer
to his freedman his share of the peculiumof the former. Moreover, there is no
doubt that the rights of patronage will pass to him who gave the slave his
freedom.
(4) Where, however, the slave is obliged to render accounts in order that no
loss may occur, or any impediment be placed in the way of emancipation, the
Governor of the province, or some competent magistrate, must fix the time
within which his accounts shall be rendered, and any debts which may appear by
them to be due shall be discharged, and he shall then obtain his liberty.
(5) Again, in order that there may be no doubt as to the amount of the price to
be paid for the slave, but that this may be perfectly clear, We order that the
valuation of a slave, whether male or female, provided he or she is not skilled
in any trade, shall be twenty solidi,and that those slaves who have reached
their tenth year shall be valued at only ten solidi.When, however, they are
skilled in any trade, with the exception of writers and physicians, their price
shall be established up to thirty solidi,whether they are men or women. A
writer or a physician, either male or female, shall be valued as follows: a
writer up to fifty solidi,and a physician up to sixty. When eunuchs, who are
common slaves and are over ten years of age, are not familiar with any trade,
they shall be valued at fifty solidi,but if they are skilled artisans they
shall be valued up to seventy. We do not wish eunuchs under ten years of age to
be valued at more than thirty solidi.
Joint-owners shall accept the amounts due to them according to the above-
mentioned standard, and shall be compelled by competent judges to grant the
slave his freedom.
(6) If one or more of the joint-owners of a slave desire to liberate him, or
release him at his own solicitation, the latter paying the price, or one or
more of them say that they desire to free him and pay his value, he shall be
preferred who first manifested this generous intention. But when all of them
come forward with the object of manumitting the slave, then a competent judge
shall compel them all to grant him his freedom without compensation, and his
peculium,shall be distributed among all the joint-owners in proportion to their
shares in the slave. All those who granted freedom to the slave shall be
equally entitled to the rights of patronage.
(7) The right of accrual, introduced by the ancient laws with reference to the
manumission of slaves owned in common, is hereby annulled, and We shall not
hereafter, under any circumstances, permit it to be considered.
Given on the Kalends ofApril, during the Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes,
530.
2. The Same to Julianus, Prastorian Prefect.
It was held by all the ancient jurisconsults that a slave owned in common
belonged partly to one master and partly to another, so that he could be
bequeathed to himself, or to others, hence the following question arose. Two or
more persons owned a slave in common, and one of them bequeathed his own share
to the slave, and this having caused perplexity, a serious controversy arose
among the ancients. Therefore We, having examined this bequest with great care,
think that it is capable of two interpretations, for the testator either
thought that the slave would become free, so far as his share, which he
bequeathed to him in this way, was concerned, or if this was not the case, he
was actuated by affection for his other joint-owner, in order that the slave
might be acquired by him, intending that his heirs should not gain possession
of the slave, so that it would be clear that he should not, by any means, be
included in the property of his
estate.
We, however, who are partisans of freedom, after investigation have come to the
conclusion that, with reference to the doubtful intention of the testator,
since he desired to liberate the slave, so far as his own share was concerned,
and as slaves owned in common are manumitted, We have already decided what was
necessary to be done under such circumstances, and the present case shall be
determined by the provisions of the aforesaid law. The slave shall therefore
become free, so far as the share of the testator is concerned, in compliance
with the will of the latter; and with reference to the other share, in
accordance with Our ruling, the price must be paid by the heir to the other
joint-owner, or owners, in obedience to the above-mentioned constitution, and
if they refuse to accept it, he shall tender it, seal it up, and deposit it at
their risk, as it is an attribute of Imperial Majesty to adopt the more humane
course instead of the harsher one.
TITLE Vill.
CONCERNING THE MANUMISSION OF A SLAVE WHO HAS BEEN GIVEN IN PLEDGE.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Proculus.
Although a husband, who is solvent, can manumit a dotal slave, still there is
no doubt that if it should appear that you have been given in pledge to his
wife, you cannot obtain your freedom without her consent.
2. The Same Emperors to Abascantus.
Where freedom is granted to a slave by a debtor of the Treasury, and the slave
has not been pledged by the terms of a special agreement but only under the
general privilege of the Treasury, the manumission cannot be annulled, unless
it is established that it was made with fraudulent intent.
3. The Same Emperors to Antony.
It is certain that he who has pledged the property which he now has, or may
hereafter acquire, can grant freedom to his slaves. This rule of law does not
apply to slaves who have been expressly encumbered by way of pledge, or
delivered for that purpose.
4. The Emperor Alexander to Sabiniamis.
If (as you allege) you, together with other slaves, after having been pledged,
were manumitted by the debtor, with the consent of his creditor, you are
entitled to your freedom.
Published on the sixth of the Idesof May, during the Consulate of Alexander,
223.
5. The Same Emperor to Extritatianus.
If the creditors have been paid, the female slaves who were pledged and
manumitted by the debtor will be free. If the person who manumitted them, or
his heirs, should, for the purpose of revoking their freedom, venture to say
that he had granted the manumission for the purpose of defrauding his
creditors, neither he nor his heirs shall be heard.
6. The Same Emperor to Auctionus.
If your guardian manumitted slaves purchased with your money, and said slaves,
together with other property belonging to or purchased with the property of the
wards, have been pledged in accordance with the constitution of the Emperors,
My Parents, the said slaves shall not, on account of the indulgence shown to
wards, become free.
7. The Emperor Gordian to Juliana.
If, at the time of your marriage, whether you gave slaves by way of dowry, or
whether, after the dowry was given, your husband purchased them with money
forming part of your dowry, the ownership of said slaves will justly belong to
you, and therefore you are vainly attempting to raise a question with reference
to their status after manumission, as they can legally be manumitted by him who
purchased them, or received them as dowry.
TITLE IX.
CONCERNING THE MANUMISSION OP SLAVES BELONGING TO THE STATE.
1. The Emperor Gordian to Epigonus.
If, as is provided by the municipal law and the Imperial Constitutions, you
have been regularly manumitted, when you were a public slave (with the consent
of the Governor of the province), you should not again be reduced to slavery on
the ground that you were not en-
titled to manumission because the slave whom you gave instead of yourself took
to flight.
2. The Same Emperor to Hadriana.
If the Governor of the province approved the decree by which he with whom you
afterwards (as you allege) were united in marriage received his freedom, there
is no doubt that the child born of a marriage of this kind is a Roman citizen
and under the control of his father.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Philadelphus.
The freedman of a municipality does not become a slave where the title by which
the ownership of slaves is usually established cannot be produced. If,
therefore, you have been manumitted according to the law of Vectibulicius
(whose authority it was held extended to the provinces under the Decree of the
Senate issued during the Consulate of Jubentius Celsus, Consul for the second
time, and Neratius Marcellus), you will be entitled to the rights of Roman
citizenship, nor did you afterwards, while a freedman, by discharging the
duties of a notary, lose the liberty which you obtained, and your act does not
offer any impediment to the acceptance of your son as decurion, as he was born
of parents who were free.
TITLE X.
CONCERNING SLAVES MANUMITTED BY OTHERS THAN THEIR MASTERS.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Cornelius.
It has frequently been stated in rescripts that anyone who manumits slaves
belonging to another, as if they were his own, will be required to pay to the
owners of the same their value, or the amount of damages which the latter may
have sustained.
Published during the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Antoninus and
Balbinus, 214.
2. The Emperor Alexander to Mercurialis.
If Felicissima, who you say purchased a slave by your order, manumitted him
without transferring his ownership to you, you, in vain, demand that he whom
you allege was manumitted should be refused his freedom, and that possession of
him should be delivered to you.
3. The Same Emperor to Pompeius.
He who sold you the estate will continue to be the owner of the property until
he delivers it to you, and, therefore, by manumitting a slave belonging to the
estate, he grants him his freedom.
Published on the sixth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of
Agricola and Clement, 231.
4. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus to ZoUus.
If you did not give the ownership, but merely the services of the female slave
referred to, when granting her her freedom, the person to whom she was given
shall only have the use of her dependent upon your will, and your right of
ownership will not, in the slightest degree, be prejudiced, for no one can
bestow freedom upon a slave belonging to another by manumitting him as if he
was his own.
5. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Marcellina.
Where slaves have been given by way of donation, the donor has no right to
manumit them.
6. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Milius and Others.
If your father manumitted your slave, even with your consent, and you were
under the age of twenty years, he could not grant him his freedom.
7. The Emperor Constantine to Bassus.
Where freedom is granted to the slave of another than his master, and the
consent of judges who have a right to give it is obtained, there need be no
apprehension of the imposition of a penalty. If, however, it is established
that the act was legally performed by Our order, and it is proved that the
owner did not petition for authority to manumit the slave of another, then he
who is shown to have obtained his freedom by Our generosity to a person who was
not his master shall be immediately restored to him to whom his ownership
belongs, and he who manumitted the slave of another by deceiving the Emperor
shall be compelled to give two slaves of the s'ame sex, age, and occupation to
the master of the one whom he manumitted, and he shall also be compelled to
give three of the same kind to the Treasury.
This penalty should not always be imposed, but should preferably not be
inflicted if the manumitted slave is able to plead lawful prescription when a
question is raised as to his status, as the owner can only blame himself for
his loss, if he, by his silence, confirmed the act to his own disadvantage.
Published during the Idesof July, during the Consulate of Constantine, Consul
for the fifth time, and Licinius, 319.
TITLE XI.
WHO CANNOT MANUMIT SLAVES, AND CONCERNING THE PREVENTION OF MANUMISSION FOR THE
PURPOSE OF
DEFRAUDING CREDITORS. 1. The Emperor Alexander to Antiochus.
It is a certain rule of law established by the Lex &lia Sentia,that grants of
freedom for the purpose of defrauding creditors, when made directly, can only
be revoked where an intention to commit fraud ex^
ists; that is to say, when this is the design of the person who granted the
manumission, and a loss ensues as a result of the intent.
It was formerly decided that the beneficiaries of a trust should be classed as
creditors.
Published on the third of the Idesof November, during the Consulate of
Maximian, Consul for the fifth time, and ^lianus, 224.
2. The Same Emperor to Natalianus.
It is set forth in the Imperial Mandates that my slaves cannot, by means of the
interposition of other persons, confer freedom on slaves who constitute part of
their peculium.
3. The Same Emperor to Justina.
The Senate, at the suggestion of the Divine Marcus, provided that no one could
manumit his own slave, or the slave of another who was a performer in an
exhibition which was being given, and that, if this took place, the manumission
should be considered void.
4. The Same Emperor to Felicissimus.
If, while under twenty years of age, you delivered slaves for the purpose of
rendering them free, it has been decided by a Decree of the Senate that your
act is void.
Extract from Novel 119, Chapter II. Latin Text.
At the present time, however, those who have testamentary capacity can bequeath
freedom to slaves, the ancient law having been repealed.
5. The Same Emperor to Priscus.
When it can be proved that freedom was fraudulently granted by persons indebted
to the Treasury, the act will not be valid. If, however, he who you state is
your father paid the purchaser the money, and the slave, having been redeemed
by him, obtained his freedom, it cannot be said that the property of a debtor
to the Treasury has been, in any respect, diminished.
6. The Emperor Diocletian and Maximian, and the Gsesars, to Olympia.
It is a positive rule of law that a guardian cannot grant freedom to slaves
under a trust with which his female ward has been charged. Hence, if you were
charged with their manumission, and did not liberate them when you arrived at
the age fixed by the testator, but your guardian did so, they will still remain
in servitude.
7. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Zoticus.
If your master, who was indebted on account of his administration of a
curatorship, having been proved to be insolvent, should bequeath you your
freedom under a trust, this will be of no advantage to you, as in all fiduciary
grants of freedom the condition of the estate must only be considered.
TITLE XII. WHO CANNOT OBTAIN THEIR FREEDOM.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Torquatus.
As my Father, the Divine Claudius, decided that persons condemned to perpetual
imprisonment could not be liberated by the Governors of provinces, or by other
officials who have authority to punish crime; and that those sentenced for a
term of years, who have been appointed heirs, or have received legacies or
bequests under a trust cannot, during their imprisonment, obtain their freedom;
nor can any one of those to whom such bequests have been made acquire them; but
if they have served out the time for which they were condemned, and have been
released from all restraint, and, as it were, restored to their former simple
condition of slavery, they will be entitled to their freedom, if it was left to
them by the will of a deceased person during the period of their sentence,
without any question being raised as to the punishment which they have
undergone.
2. The Emperors Valerian and Galliemis to Theodore.
He who has been forbidden by will to be manumitted cannot obtain his freedom.
But in the case proposed, it makes a difference whether or not those whom the
testator forbade to be sold or manumitted, stating that they had been brought
up with his children, did so because he considered their services necessary to
his household, and for the benefit of his children, or whether he imposed this
restriction as a penalty for bad behavior: for, in the first instance, the
slaves can obtain their liberty after the death of those whose interests were
consulted, but in the second, what has been decided with reference to the
punishment of slaves will remain in full force.
It was decided by My Divine Parents that the provisions of wills imposing
perpetual servitude upon undeserving slaves should be observed, in order that
they might not obtain their freedom through a fraudulent purchaser.
TITLE XIII.
FOR WHAT REASONS SLAVES CAN RECEIVE THEIR FREEDOM AS A REWARD.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Firmanus.
Since scrupulous care as well as the authority of the law should be exercised
for the purpose of increasing and encouraging the practice of fidelity by
slaves, if you can establish by undoubted proof that you have strenuously
exerted yourself to avenge the death of your master, the freedom which was long
since ordered by Decrees of the Senate and Laws of the Emperors to be granted
to slaves who avenge the death of their masters cannot be conferred upon you,
even after having rendered so great a service, merely through the performance
of your act, but you must obtain it by appearing before the tribunal of the
Governor, and in consequence of his decree.
Published on the seventh of the Idesof December, during the Consulate of
Maximus.
2. The Emperor Constantine to Januarius.
Slaves who publicly denounce those who engage in the nefarious occupation of
counterfeiting money shall be given Roman citizenship, and their master shall
be paid their value by the Treasury.
Given at Rome, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate
of Crispus.
3. The Same Emperor to the People.
If a slave should publicly denounce someone guilty of ravishing a virgin, who
has escaped arrest through the connivance of the injured person, or because a
compromise has been effected, he shall be given his freedom.
Given on the day before the Kalendsof April.
4. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Syag-rius.
When a slave betrays a deserter from the army, he shall be presented with his
freedom.
Given on the Idesof July at Rome, ....
TITLE XIV. CONCERNING THE MANUMISSION OF FREEBORN PERSONS.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Philetus.
If, although you have been manumitted by will, you state that you are freeborn,
you should bring your case before the proper court, and if you have a lawful
opponent, that is to say, one who alleges that he is your patron, you must
remember that the Senate decreed that those who, after their manumission,
claimed to be freeborn, must leave in the house of the person who manumitted
them any property which they may have acquired while there. It has been decided
by authorities learned in the law that whatever was bequeathed or given to a
freedman is included under this head.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Pompeia.
Neither provision for support, nor the services exacted of servitude, will
render a freeborn woman a slave, nor will manumission render her a freedwoman.
Published on the fifth of the Idesof May, during the Consulate of Sabinus,
Consul for the second time, and Venustus, 241.
3. The Emperor Philip to Felicissimus.
If it is proved that your grandmother, although manumitted as a slave, was
afterwards solemnly declared to be freeborn, and her con-
dition was established by the authority of a judicial decision, and you brought
this matter to the attention of persons learned in the law, you must have
readily ascertained that her children, even though they were born before the
decision was rendered, have good reason to demand their liberty, as being
freeborn.
4. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csssars, to Agrippa.
Asyou state that one of your freeborn relatives, who was made prisoner under
the rule of the faction of Palmyra, and sold as a captive, the Governor of the
province will see that he recovers his status as a freeborn citizen.
5. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Crescens.
It is extremely unjust for the condition of freeborn persons to be disputed
through the mistake or malice of others, especially as you allege that one
Governor after another has been applied to by you to summon the adverse party,
in order that he might oppose your claim, if he thought that he had a valid
defence. As the result of this, it appears that the Governor of the province,
being influenced by your statements, rendered a decision that you should not
hereafter be subjected to annoyance. Therefore, if the other party should still
remain obstinate, the Governor, having been applied to, shall take measures to
have you protected from wrong.
Given on the day before the Nonesof ....
6. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Dionysius.
It is a perfectly clear rule of law that a person who is free cannot become the
slave of one who is aware of his condition. Therefore, as you allege that the
father of the ward of whom you have made mention in your petition kept you in
his service as a freeman for a long time, he could not have changed your
condition without having a legal title by which the ownership of property is
ordinarily acquired.
Ordered on the seventh of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors.
7. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Matrona.
If it is established that you and your children are freeborn, the fact of your
birth will be a sufficient defence, for he who raises the question of slavery
by renouncing any claims which he may have, can, in no way, weaken the evidence
of freebirth, or gain any advantage by doing so.
8. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Callimorphus.
Freeborn persons come into the world as such. Freedmen can only be created by
manumission. Moreover, an agreement cannot confer the privilege of free birth
upon either slaves or freedmen, nor can the rights of those who have not given
their consent to a transaction of this kind be prejudiced in any way.
9. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Patamon.
It is a clear and manifest rule of law that a woman born of a mother who has
been manumitted is born free, and therefore, as you allege that since your
mother was a freedwoman, and was afterwards captured by the enemy, and returned
home under the rule of postliminium,and that now the question is raised whether
or not you are a slave, you must appear before the Governor of the province,
who has jurisdiction of cases in which freedom is involved, and he will render
a decision according to law, knowing that neither the status of your mother
under such circumstances nor the captivity which she endured will change her
former condition in any respect.
10. The Same Emperors and Csssars to Athenodora.
Names are given by public consent for the purpose of recognizing individuals,
and no damage results if they are changed for the purpose of concealing the
origin of persons who are freeborn; and the possession of anyone as a slave
(even though he may perform the services of one) does not render him such if he
was born free.
11. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Maxima.
If no title establishes the right to possess you as a slave, but, on the other
hand, you can prove that you were born free, and performed services for wages,
which were agreed upon, your condition is in no respect injuriously affected,
nor will you be forbidden to institute legal proceedings to compel the
fulfillment of the contract.
Ordered on the Nonesof March, during the Consulate of the Csesars.
12. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Quieta.
The commission of the crime of kidnapping has no effect in changing the status
of a freeborn woman; but it is established that one who has been abducted can,
even afterwards, remain in the condition in which she was born.
Ordered on the third of ....
13. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Melander.Anyone who contends that he is
freeborn, but is unable to prove it, does not necessarily lose his status as a
freedman. Ordered on the seventh of the Idesof December.
14. The Same fflmperors and Csesars to Aristotle.The condition of a freeborn
woman can, in no way, be prejudiced, merely from the fact that she has been
given in betrothal as a female
slave.
Ordered on the seventh of the Kalendsof January, ....
TITLE XV.
GENERAL PROVISIONS WITH REFERENCE TO MANUMISSIONS. 1. The Emperor Justinian to
Julianus, Prsetorian Prefect.
We order that if the owner of a slave, whose usufruct belongs to another,
should grant him his freedom, he shall not, according to the ancient rule, be
deprived of it, but shall be considered as having no master, so that no one can
be found to whom any property which may be acquired by him will belong.
If, however, both the owner and the usufructuary should agree to liberate him,
he will become free without any restriction; and if he should afterwards
acquire any property, it shall be his. But when the owner alone sets him free,
without the consent of the usufructuary, he who, in this way, obtains his
liberty from his owner, shall be included among the freedmen of the latter; and
if he should afterwards obtain any property, he shall acquire it in his own
name and be permitted to leave it to his descendants, the right of patronage
being always reserved, unless his emancipator was deprived of it by the laws.
The freedman himself, however, shall remain with the usufructuary as a slave,
as long as the former lives, unless he is deprived of the usufruct in a lawful
manner. Where the usufruct is terminated in any way, then the slave shall be
permitted to reside wherever he pleases. If, however, the freedman should die
during the lifetime of the usufructuary, his estate shall descend according to
law. Where the usufructuary alone grants freedom to the slave, the usufruct
reverts to the owner, and he will enjoy complete authority over the slave, and
the latter will acquire all property for him, in accordance with what has been
generally provided with reference to slaves and masters. If the usufructuary
should release the slave from the usufruct, for the purpose of doing him a
favor, and then present him with his freedom, the slave will remain under the
control of the owner, but the necessity is not imposed upon slaves during the
life of the usufructuary, or for the time that the usufruct may exist, to obey
the owner, and perform the services required of a slave, but Our judge shall
see that he remains unmolested.
After the death of the usufructuary, or where the usufruct has been
extinguished in any way, he shall serve the master as a slave, and all property
which may, in the meantime, come into his hands, he will acquire for his
master.
This separation shall exist between masters and slaves as provided by the terms
of Our Constitution, and not in accordance with the ancient law by which the
said slaves remained without a master.
(1) We make the following addition to this law, namely, that the ancient
distinction of persons having been abolished, parents of either sex shall be
permitted, in the case of sons and daughters who are under their control or
emancipated and their descendants of every degree, to impose their commands
upon them by will, so far as granting freedom to slaves is concerned; whether
the testator desired that
this should be done in a church, or in any other lawful manner which he might
select. For, since in successions, as well as in almost all other things, no
distinction is made between children, this rule must be observed (and above all
in the present instance) in favor of freedom which is especially and peculiarly
Our care to cherish and protect by the Roman laws.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of
Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
2. The Same Emperor to Julianus, Prsetorian Prefect.
Where anyone bestows freedom upon a slave, either in a church or any other
sacred edifice, or in any tribunal, or before any judge who has authority under
the law to grant freedom, whether this be done by will, or by any final
disposition of property, either directly or under the terms of a trust, the age
of those who obtain their freedom shall, under no circumstances, offer any
impediment. For We do not wish that those only who have passed the age of
thirty shall acquire Roman citizenship, as was formerly done, but, as in the
case of ecclesiastical enfranchisement, no distinction of age exists, so
whenever freedom is granted by masters to slaves either under last wills,
before magistrates, or in any other legal manner, We order that they shall all
become Roman citizens; for We think that the number of those should rather be
increased than diminished.
3. The Same Emperor to John, Praetorian Prefect.
Where a man who has no wife keeps his female slave as a concubine, and persists
in this practice until his death, whether he had children by her or not, We
order that the said female slave shall, under no circumstances, belong to his
heirs, and that her children, if she has any, shall not be reduced to slavery;
but that, after the death of her master, she, together with her offspring, if
she has had any by the deceased, shall obtain their freedom in the manner to be
explained hereafter.
We grant permission to the master, during his lifetime, to make use of his
female slaves, as well as of their offspring, in any way that he may desire,
and to dispose of them by his last will in accordance with his wishes; that is
to say, bequeath them as slaves to others, or leave them by name to his heirs
to remain in servitude.
But if he should pass them over in silence, then, after his death, they shall
obtain their freedom, which will date from the death of their master. Neither
the ancient laws nor Our own, however, permit men who have wives to keep either
freedwomen, or slaves as concubines.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof November, after the Consulate of
Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
TITLE XVI. CONCERNING CASES INVOLVING FREEDOM.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Saturninus.
You confess that you have committed an unlawful and dishonorable act, as you
state that your own children, who were born free, have been sold by you; but,
for the reason that what you have done cannot injure your children, go before a
competent judge (if you desire to do so) in order that the case may be decided
in conformity with the law.
Published on the fifth of the Ides ofFebruary, ....
2. The Same Emperor to Veronianus.
If those who you allege are your slaves are declared by others to be free,
their status must be determined in the ordinary way, for even where a decision
has been rendered with reference to their ownership, this cannot be advanced in
opposition to a matter involving freedom.
Given at Rome on the Nonesof February, during the Consulate of Messala and
Sabinus, 215.
3. The Emperor Alexander to Quirinus.
If a freeman cohabits with the female slave of another, he does not become the
slave of her master, even if he has been notified to abandon her.
Published on the Nonesof February, during the Consulate of Fuscus and Dexter,
226.
4. The Same Emperor to Jocundus.
If he whom you claim as a slave has, after proper investigation, been decided
to be free (although this may have been done in your absence), another
opportunity to claim him as a slave shall not be afforded you. If, however,
after you ascertained the fact, you appealed from the decision of the judge, it
shall be determined by the appellate court whether judgment was rendered in
accordance with law.
5. The Same Emperor to Sabinus.
The woman whom you declared to be your slave is none the less entitled to
demand her freedom, because you purchased her from the Treasury. Nor can
recourse to prescription be had at the present time, because, when the sale
took place, the woman was more than twenty years old, as age cannot be pleaded
by way of prescription against Roman citizenship, unless the slave is shown to
have consented to become such in consideration of sharing the price.
The burden of proof is placed upon one who, being a slave, asserts that he is
free, and if he cannot establish his assertion, you will obtain the undisputed
right of possession.
6. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus, and the Csesar Valerian, to Versimenus.
Even if you voluntarily stated in writing that you were a slave, and not free,
you would not, by doing so, prejudice your rights in
any respect, and this is all the more true as you allege that you are compelled
to do this.
7. The Emperor Aurelian to Secundus.
If you have been manumitted by the person whose slave you were, there is no
reason for you to maintain the controversy with reference to your freedom, and
above all, with the heir who manumitted you; for even if your freedom was not
legally obtained, the heir, on account of his acceptance of the estate, has
confirmed the will of the deceased by his consent.
8. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Verina.
As you allege that it was agreed between your former owner and yourself that he
should, upon the payment of a certain sum of money, manumit you as well as your
daughter, and he only liberated you, you should appear before the Governor of
the province and he will urge your former master to abide by his agreement, all
respect which freedmen are accustomed to display toward their patrons being
shown him.
Given on the day before ...., during the Consulate of Maximus, Consul for the
second time, and Aquilinus, 286.
9. The Same Emperors and Ciesars to Proculus.
As the terms of your petition set forth, he against whom you filed it is the
son of your female slave, still as you refer to him by a name which can only be
borne by persons who are free, and state that he is not a slave, but only bears
the stigma of servitude, you are notified that your petition is directed
against one who is not a slave.
10. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Stratonicus.
It is a positive rule of law that freemen cannot become slaves, and their
condition be changed either by a private agreement, or by any act of
administration whatsoever.
11. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Faustinus.
Slaves will not change their status if they unlawfully and dishonorably obtain
public office. Wherefore, if a question arises with reference to yours, you are
advised that it is of no advantage to you that your father enjoyed civil
distinction. Hence, after all the legal formalities have been complied with,
your condition must be determined by the Governor of the province.
12. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Proculus.
If you were born of a female slave, and someone purchased you, you will remain
in the condition in which you formerly were; but if, being the child of a
female slave, your natural father, who was also your master, sold you, and
afterwards you paid the price to the purchaser, you will not, for that reason,
obtain your freedom.
Published on the eighteenth of the Kalendsof May, ....
13. The Same Emperors and Caesars to Paulus.
Ajudicial tribunal cannot concern itself principally with the status of a
deceased person. If, then, property is claimed, as part of the
peculiumbelonging to the estate of him whom you mention as having bequeathed
it, or if any question arises as to the status of his children, all these
points must be formally decided by the Governor of the province.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof May, ....
14. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Quintianus.
When proceedings have been instituted with reference to one whose liberty is in
dispute, and he is in possession of it, he will, in the meantime, be considered
free.
Given at Heraclea, on the fourth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of
the above-mentioned Emperors.
15. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Palladius.
The loss of a document establishing anyone's birth does not exclude other
evidence to prove the same, nor can a forged document of this kind affect the
truth. Therefore, in order to ascertain the truth every proof allowed by law
should be admitted, and the Governor of the province having been applied to,
and all requisite formalities having been observed, he will decide the case
between you in accordance with the legal requirements.
16. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Diogenia.
If you, being a free woman, have served as such, and, without your knowledge,
an instrument was drawn up under whose terms you were given by way of dowry as
a female slave, these things can, in no way, prejudice your freedom; and, above
all, as you state that you were a minor at the time, and it has been decided
that minors less than twenty years old can, under no circumstances, change
their status and become slaves instead of freemen, in order that no one may
unintentionally lose his liberty before reaching the age at which others cannot
confer it without authority.
Published on the sixth of the Idesof May, during the Consulate of Hadrian.
17. The Same Emperors and Caesars to Resinus.
In numerous instances, the status of brothers who are freeborn varies, on
account of the commission of crime, or other events which have taken place.
Therefore, there is nothing to prevent the question of status being raised with
reference to those whom you assert are your brothers, and whether they shall be
claimed as slaves, or maintained in servitude. Hence, other evidence is
necessary to establish their freedom, for it is clear that the fact that your
liberty has not been questioned is not sufficient proof.
18. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Zoticus.
The lease made to you by the person against whose heirs you have brought suit
is not sufficient evidence of your free origin, nor does this alone show
conclusively that you are a slave.
Given on the Idesof July, at Philippi, under the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors.
19. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Paulus.
In Our opinion, he against whom you have filed your petition, rather than you
yourself, has the principal interest in the case, for as you state that you
have given him his freedom, it is more to his interest to formally defend his
status, and consequently your case also is included in his; for if he is
declared to be a slave by the party against whom you have filed your petition,
he can claim his freedom on the ground of your manumission, and, by proving his
original servitude, and showing that he obtained his freedom through your
having manumitted him, your right of patronage will be preserved.
When, however, he prefers to remain a slave, then, after having appeared before
the Governor of the province, you will be permitted by law to defend him even
against his own consent.
20. The Same Emperors and Caesars to Mternalis.
Just as when freedom has once been conferred it cannot be revoked, so, where
masters take any steps whatever against their own slaves, without the intention
of manumitting them, they will sustain no loss.
Ordered on the sixth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
21. The Same Emperors and C&sars to Thrasylla.
It is provided by the Perpetual Edict that a woman who is found in the
possession of freedom fraudulently obtained occupies the same position as one
who is still in servitude. If, however, any controversy should arise, whether
she who is in slavery petitions for freedom, or whether it is clearly proved
that, while free, an attempt has been made to enslave her, no fraud committed
by a female slave should deprive her master of his rights.
Ordered on the Nonesof October, during the Consulate of the above-mentioned
Emperors.
22. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Pardala.
It is a man's parents, and not his own statements, that establish the fact of
his birth. Wherefore, if, having been born of a female slave, and afterwards
manumitted, you obtained your freedom, you can, by no means, lose it, either
through fraudulently or erroneously contending that you are the child of
another female slave, for slaves are known to be born in that condition, and
are not rendered such merely by their own assertions.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
23. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Muscia.
If freedom was directly bequeathed to you by your master in his will, and his
daughters succeeded him as his appointed heirs, it does not follow that, either
according to his will, or in opposition to it, if you serve one of his
daughters, the others can revoke your freedom.
24. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Sebastian.
Awoman is not excluded from demanding her freedom, if she has been interrogated
and has publicly acknowledged that she is a slave.
25. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Licentianus.
When the instruments evidencing manumission, which was legally effected, have
not been drawn up, this, in no way, prejudices the grant of freedom, so that,
if you have liberated a slave, the failure to execute such instruments cannot
possibly injure him.
Ordered on the fifth of the Idesof February, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
26. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Modestus.
A patron cannot revoke freedom when it has once been bestowed upon a manumitted
slave; and he can be compelled to produce the instrument evidencing the
manumission.
27. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Austerius.
If Arianus was declared to be free, after the question as to his status had
been raised by Leonis, he cannot again be claimed as a slave by the former,
after he has lost his case. A co-heir having been given to you by Arianus, who
was in collusion with the person who raised the controversy with reference to
the status of the deceased, or his heirs, cannot injure you in any respect, nor
can admissions made by them affect the truth, or change the condition of the
estate of the deceased.
28. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Eurymedontus.
The fact that a paternal grandfather was invested with the dignity of a
magistrate can be of no advantage to his grandson, in proving that he is free,
as in a case involving freedom the status of the mother and not that of the
father must be considered. The civil condition of the maternal grandmother is
not of itself sufficient, for although she was proved to be free, still, a
person's status may be lost in many ways.
Given on the fourth of the Idesof April, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors.
29. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Troila.
There is no doubt that a daughter born of a female slave, and who was purchased
by the man with whom she afterwards lived in concubinage, will remain in
servitude if she is not manumitted.
30. The Same Emperors and Caesars to Eutychia.Freedom, when once bestowed,
cannot be revoked under the sole pretext that proper respect has not been shown
to the patron.
31. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Cassiana.
If an inquiry has been wrongfully instituted for the purpose of proving you to
be a slave, and you have brought suit for malicious prosecution, or for injury
committed (whichever one you may select), and it has been decided that you were
a slave, you can afterwards ask that judgment be rendered against the adverse
party, and that restitution be made of the property of which you can prove that
you are deprived, after a decision has been given declaring you to be free.
32. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Athenais.
The signature of the son of the master who manumitted you does not add anything
to, or if it is omitted, does not detract in any way from a grant of freedom.
33. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Melitiana.
Although your master manumitted you after you had paid him a sum of money,
still the freedom which you have received cannot be revoked.
Ordered on the third of the Idesof November, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
34. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Eremonia.A free woman does not become a
slave on account of living in concubinage.
Given on the Idesof November, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
35. The Same Emperors and Csssars to Attatus.
The fact that a person is said to have administered the affairs of a minor in
the capacity of his guardian does not release him from defending himself, when
the question as to whether or not he is a slave is raised.
Given on the Nonesof November, during the Consulate of the Caesars.
36. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Theodore.
When a mistress agrees with her female slave that, after having served her for
a certain time, she shall become free, she will, by no means, be required to
observe her contract. On the other hand, it is also true that a free woman can
not be compelled to comply with her agreement, if she is proved to have
promised to give you her own children as slaves.
37. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Olympius.
If you sold your son, who is free, to your son-in-law, who, being so closely
connected with you, could not pretend ignorance of his condition, you cannot
accuse one another of crime.
38. The Same Emperors and Caesars to Philesarphus.
An action to determine your status can be brought against you, in the name of
the State, notwithstanding the fact that no one denies that you have been
created limenarch.1
Given at Nicomedia, on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the
Consulate of the Caesars.
39. The Same Emperors and Caesars to Potesenticus.
It is settled that freemen who allege that they are slaves cannot change their
condition.
Ordered on the seventh of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
40. A Copy of the Imperial Letters of the Above-Mentioned Emperors and Ctesars
to Verutus.
According to the provisions of Our Edict, nothing will prevent a case involving
freedom from being heard and a decision rendered in accordance with justice,
notwithstanding the absence of one of the parties, whether the controversy
arose with reference to manumission or free birth.
41. The Emperors Constantine and Licinius to Eutychius, Governor of Cappadocia.
We order that all the letters that the mistress of the slave ^lius wrote to him
as Chief Decurion shall be null and void and revoked as of no effect, and that
the investigation to determine the free birth of the said ^lius shall proceed,
nor shall the rights of the woman be prejudiced for the reason that she
addressed him as Chief Decurion, or that he himself pretended to be a decurion
or the head of that body, when his servile condition has been ascertained not
only by the testimony of witnesses, and that of his relatives, but also by the
admissions made by himself in the presence of another magistrate.
42. The Emperor Constantius to Maximus, Prsetorian Prefect.
It has been decided that children born of a mother whose condition is contested
shall follow her after judgment has been rendered in the case. Any, however,
whose birth occurred before the suit was instituted, shall have their status
determined separately, since those alone who were born during the proceedings
are to be included in the decision given with reference to their mother, and
shall either be delivered to their lawful owners, or enjoy their freedom with
their parents.
Given on the day before the Idesof July, ....

CONCERNING THE ABOLITION OF LEGAL, ASSERTIONS THAT A MAN Is FREE.
1. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Prsetorian Prefect.
We order that actions involving the servile condition which have been begun
shall be regarded with favor, as well as shortened; and direct that if anyone
who, up to the time, has served as a slave, should declare himself to be free,
or while enjoying freedom should be claimed as a slave, he shall, in neither
instance, be required to provide a defender,1 but shall himself answer in his
own proper person the claim of him who alleges that he is his master; and if,
after having been in the possession of freedom, he should be reduced to
slavery, he shall be forbidden to employ an attorney, We absolutely forbid
those who have passed from slavery to freedom to defend themselves in this way,
all the laws which provide that cases requiring defenders shall be heard a
second and a third time being, for the future, repealed; for it is just that
the first decision should remain in full force, where no appeal is taken. If
one is taken, the judge shall examine the case just as he would any other which
has been appealed, without a second examination being required by the laws
enacted with reference to cases in which defenders appear, and which We have
rescinded.
(1) We also abolish the ancient rule requiring defence in actions involving the
peculiumor other personal effects of slaves, directing that not ,only the
peculiumof those who, while in servitude, have tak.en legal steps to become
free, but also any other property which is claimed shall be placed in safe-
keeping, by order of court.
(2) Moreover, all those whose freedom is in danger through their being claimed
as slaves shall be compelled to furnish a surety, if they wish to do so; but
when it is impossible for them to provide one, and this is clearly proved to
the judge, they shall be bound by being sworn.
If, after proceedings of this kind have been instituted, they purposely absent
themselves, and, having been summoned to appear, remain absent for more than a
year; they shall, by all means, be reduced to slavery, and decided beyond
question to be the property of him who brought suit against them.

(3) Again, We wish those who claim anyone as a slave to know that, if after the
first demand has been presented in any court, or made by virtue of an Imperial
Rescript, and he who is alleged to be a slave has been notified, and, having
been released, the parties bring another claim against him in a different
court, even if the reputed slave should have given occasion for this to be
done, the plaintiffs, although they may be his legal masters, shall be deprived
of their right.
Given on the third of the Idesof December, ....
2. The Same Emperor to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
We think that the difficulty which may arise under Our present law, authorizing
adsertores,should be disposed of by a comprehensive remedy. As the action with
reference to freedom was usually conducted by them, if, while this was taking
place, the principal party in interest should die, the necessity was,
nevertheless, imposed upon the adsertorto conduct the case to a conclusion, so
that if the purchaser should be defeated, and a decision be rendered in favor
of freedom, he can have recourse against the vendor, and the latter return to
him what was contained in the bill of sale, or what the nature of the contract
required, on account of having sold him a person who was free.
Moreover, as the empty name of adsertoris abolished by the present law, if any
person whose status is the subject of litigation should die, how can the
judgment be executed where only one party is left to appear in court? Therefore
We decree that, in the present instance, the purchaser shall be permitted to
proceed against the vendor to the extent of proving that the latter sold him a
freeman as a slave, or if he cannot do this, that he should be subjected to the
risk of eviction for having sold a person who was free.
TITLE XVIII.
WHAT SLAVES ARE NOT PERMITTED TO DECLARE THAT
THEY ARE FREE, AND CONCERNING THE PROPERTY OF
THOSE WHO ARE FORBIDDEN TO Do So.
1. The Emperor Gordian to Proculus.
The case of him who, concealing his condition, permitted himself to be sold as
a slave, differs from that of him who shared in the price paid for himself; for
the former is not denied the right to demand his freedom, but if the latter was
a Roman citizen, and shared in the price, he cannot claim this right. The most
eminent legal authorities have decided that the same rule is applicable to one
who is entitled to his freedom under the terms of a trust.
Published on the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Gordian and Aviola,
240.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Melana.
Our predecessors, the Emperors, decreed that freedom should be denied to the
descendants of the families of robbers who had been made slaves by Imperial
donation, or by the authority of the Treasury.
3. The Emperor Constantine to Maximus, Prsetorian Prefect.
When anyone demands his freedom, he will be entitled to any of his property
which he states is in the hands of his alleged master, since, if there is no
question as to his status, the judge must at once order it to be restored, and
delivered to him. When, however, there is any doubt as to the ownership of
property which he claims, because the master refuses to surrender it, a bond
shall be executed to preserve it, and the hearing of the case shall be
postponed. If the freedom of the reputed slave should be established (as those
must be protected who have entrusted him with their property) an account of his
administration must be rendered, and everything which is due shall be paid, so
that if he is proved to be free, he who formerly acted as his master may
acquire what was given to the slave by the right of ownership, as well as
whatever was derived from the possession and profits of the said property, and
anything obtained surreptitiously from it by the alleged slave; as that could
not be free which the master placed in the hands of his slave as peculium.
Property, however, obtained either by will or donation, or which was purchased
or acquired with the profits of the same, shall belong to the said alleged
slave as being freeborn. After judgment has been rendered declaring him to be
free, all this property should be sequestered, after having been separated from
that above mentioned; so that, both having been set aside and placed in full
view, each of the parties may claim that to which he is entitled.
Given at Thessalonica, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof March, under the
Consulate of Severus and Rufinus, 343.
TITLE XIX. CONCERNING THE ORDER OF JUDICIAL INQUIRIES.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Vitalius.
As you, yourself, have acknowledged that a controversy has arisen concerning
your status, with what reason do you demand that, before it has been
established, you should be granted authority to accuse him who contends that
you are his slave ?
Therefore, as you allege that you are confident of success, appear before the
Governor of the province, who, in accordance with the general rule, will not
hesitate to render a proper decision with reference to the crime said to have
been committed, dependent, of course, upon the result of the case involving
your freedom, which must first be determined.
Published during the Idesof . . . , during the Consulate of Maximus, Consul for
the eleventh time, and Julianus, 224.
2. The Same Emperor to Gallits.
Where a controversy has arisen both with reference to the title to an estate
and the right of someone to freedom, the latter must first be heard. Where only
the ownership of the estate is directly concerned, any question involving
freedom must first be decided; but it will be sufficient for him who enjoys his
liberty to have succeeded, where judgment was rendered in his favor in an
action brought to recover the estate.
Published on the fifth of the Idesof August, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, 224.
3. The Same Emperor to Valerius.
If an accusation of crime is brought against a woman whom you say is freeborn,
the Governor must not take cognizance of this case before deciding the one in
which her liberty is involved, as, if the crime should be proved, it will be
necessary in the first place to ascertain whether she must be punished as a
woman who was free and freeborn, or as a female slave.
4. The Emperor Gordian to Menedemits.
If a controversy has arisen with reference to your status, and a decision
should be rendered in your favor at the termination of the case, you will not
be prevented from proceeding against him who asserted that he was your master.
If, however, he did not claim you as his own slave, but accused you of being
the slave of another, no judgment should be rendered on the question of
freedom, and the examination of the case before the judge will show whether the
accusation should be heard in order to determine your condition, or whether it
should be rejected.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of Gordian
and Aviola, 240.
5. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Al-phenus.
As you allege that a controversy has arisen with reference to your status, and
that you desire to bring suit to collect certain debts, the ordinary practice,
under such circumstances, is for the case involving your freedom to be decided
by the Governor of the province, after the usual formalities have been complied
with (if the law permits this to be done) ; and if you should become free, or
the decision should be that you are not a slave, then the magistrate will order
your debts to be paid to you, provided they are lawfully due; as, if the decree
should set forth that you are a slave, it is uncertain whether they are due
ttooyou as a freeman, or to your master, and their payment cannot be exacted from
your debtor.
Ordered on the day before the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors.
6. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Alexandria.
If you allege that your property has been stolen or carried away by those whom
you claim as your slaves, and they should apply to a court to grant them
freedom, and the case should be decided against them, actions for damages and
for property clandestinely removed must then be brought before the Governor of
the province, and if the persons in question are decided to be free, or not
slaves, the actions for damages and to recover whatever has been removed can be
tried; and, after proper evidence has been offered, they shall be sentenced.
If, however, the result should be otherwise, and they should be found to be
slaves, the suits having reference to the clandestine removal of the property
shall be dismissed.
Given on the third of the Idesof January, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors.
7. The Emperor Constantine to Bassus, Prsetorian Prefect.
If, when a question as to status arises, the person alleged to be a slave is
accused of having stolen something from his master, it must first be considered
whether the reputed slave, being in servitude, believes that he has a right to
his freedom; or whether, while in the enjoyment of his freedom, an attempt is
being made to reduce him to slavery. When he who is in slavery demands his
freedom, it is proper that his condition should first be decided, and
afterwards the case of the theft should be investigated, if circumstances
demand it.
But where he who is alleged to be a slave is said to have stolen something,
whatever is proved to have been taken must be returned to him, provided he
furnishes proper sureties for its preservation. If, however, he should be
unable to furnish them, then it is proper that all the property in dispute
should be sequestrated, until the controversy is settled, but this should be
done in such a way that, if the party interested has no other resources,
whatever is necessary for the expenses of litigation and for the support of the
said alleged slave must be reserved from the said property to the amount that
the judge may decide to be reasonable.
But if the question with reference to status has not been raised, but someone
has stolen certain articles, and has been ordered to restore possession of them
to the owner for the purpose of avoiding the execution of the sentence, he will
be required to return the said property without asking for security, and then
the case involving his freedom shall proceed according to law.
TITLE XX. CONCERNING THE DETECTION OP COLLUSION.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Theodore.
As you state that your mother's slave has not only been guilty of committing
sexual intercourse with her, but, in addition to this dis-
graceful conduct, has, in collusion with her and under the pretext of false
captivity, planned to have himself declared freeborn by a competent judge, and
your mother did not grant him his freedom, but, as you assert, attempted to
establish his free birth by fraudulent representations, it is clear that he
still remains her slave; for as you say that she did not manumit him, the slave
does not appear to have become free, and cannot have recourse to the Rescript
of the Divine Pius, published with reference to captivity, nor could the mere
statement that you had consented confer upon him the right of freedom.
Published on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of
Diocletian, Consul for the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third
time, 290.
2. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Milesius.
It is clearly stated by the Noninian Decree of the Senate that a freedman is
not permitted to change his status by means of a private contract, and a
penalty for collusion is fixed by it, and as well as a reward promised to the
informer.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
TITLE XXI.
THE STATUS OF A DECEASED PERSON CANNOT BE BROUGHT IN QUESTION AFTER THE
EXPIRATION OF FIVE YEARS.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Nico.
A competent judge, after having been applied to, will examine the question of
prescription, and whether the patron of Domitia, who lived as a Roman citizen
until his death, can be proved to have died five years before the controversy
with reference to the property of the said woman arose; for her condition as a
freedwoman cannot be revoked on account of the alleged incapacity of the person
who manumitted her.
2. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Maximus.
If he who appointed you his heir is said to have been a slave on account of the
condition of his mother, and she died five years before any controversy on this
point aroise, there will be ground for prescription, as no inquiry can be
instituted with reference to his status without also investigating that of his
mother.
This rule only applies to cases where the persons concerned lived as Roman
citizens, without dispute, until the time of their death.
Published during the second Consulate of Antoninus and Geta, 206.
3. The Emperor Alexander to Olympias.
Although your husband, concerning whose condition a controversy has arisen, is
dead, the case shall be continued notwithstanding his death, on account of his
estate, and it must be decided by the court having jurisdiction over estates,
or property forming part of the same.
4. The Same Emperor to Martianus.
If he whom you allege to have been your slave, and who was manumitted by your
brother, and appointed his heir, lived as a Roman citizen after his
manumission, and you did not begin proceedings for the purpose of determining
his status within five years after his death, you understand that you cannot,
in violation of the provisions of the Decree of the Senate, raise any
controversy, either with reference to the heirs appointed by your brother, or
concerning the condition of those whom he intended to be free.
If, however, you instituted proceedings before that period of time has elapsed,
and claimed his peculiumin accordance with the legal formalities required, and
also brought suit to recover the slaves who were manumitted, you will not be
prevented from proceeding in accordance with the terms of the Edict.
Published on the fifth of the ... of June, during the Consulate of Modestus and
Probus, 229.
5. The Emperor Gordian to Severus.
The rule which has been established, namely, that no question can be raised
with reference to the condition of deceased persons after the lapse of five
years, does not, in any way, apply to an apparent emancipation which has not
been perfected by law.
6. The Emperors Valerius and Gallienus to Polla.
If your mother, while living, was generally believed to be freeborn, and five
years have elapsed since her death, you can plead the well-known prescription
on this point against the State and the minor heirs, if they should attempt to
raise a question as to your condition.
Moreover, a judicial inquiry must be instituted to determine whether or not she
passed as a freeborn woman when she died, and if it was found that she was not
always considered such, the general opinion at the time of her decease must be
taken into account.
Published on the sixth of the Idesof June, during the Consulate of Secularis
and Donatus, 261.
7. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Heliodorus.
If your father lived as a freeborn man until his death, and no controversy as
to whether he was a slave of the Treasury or not arose before the Governor of
the province, who is accustomed to decide questions of this kind, but the
matter was brought before the Imperial Procurator, who is not a competent judge
of such cases, and five years elapsed after your father's death, your condition
is protected by the prescription derived from the Decree of the Senate.
8. The Same Emperors to Theodora.
The right to claim the property composing the peculiumof your slave is not
barred by prescription, if the said property is in possession of another under
an unlawful title. For the Decree of the Senate which
was enacted to prevent the revoking of the condition of deceased persons does
not apply, if the decedent, having taken to flight, died a fugitive.
Given at Milan, on the tenth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of
Diocletian and Maximian.
TITLE XXII.
CONCERNING THE PRESCRIPTION OF LONG TIME WHICH is PLEADED IN BEHALF OF AND NOT
AGAINST FREEDOM.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Mutianus.
The benefit of prescription based on long time cannot be claimed by anyone who,
for an extended period, has enjoyed freedom fraudulently obtained. Therefore,
as you acknowledge that you fled from the person whom you mentioned, you
understood that you are not in possession of liberty without being guilty of
fraud.
2. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Carcinus.
The possession of freedom lawfully acquired can be resolutely maintained by
prescription, since the favor with which it is regarded and good reason as
wellargue that prescription should benefit those who have been in possession
of liberty for the term of twenty years, without their right being challenged
by anyone seeking to disturb them, so that they may become both free, and Roman
citizens.
Given at Antioch, on the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Constantius,
Consul for the fourth time, and Maximus, Consul for the second time, 302.
3. Copy of the Imperial Letter of Constantine and Licinius addressed to
Dionysius, Temporarily in Charge of a Prefecture.
It is consistent with equity that the rights of freedom should, in no way, be
interfered with, solely on account of lapse of time, even if the term of sixty
years has passed.
Given on the fourth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Volusianus
and Annianus, 314.
TITLE XXIII.
CONCERNING THE PECULIUM OF HIM WHO HAS OBTAINED His FREEDOM.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Rufinus.
You should not forget that a great difference exists between the cases of those
who have been manumitted by persons who were living at the time, and those to
whom freedom has been bequeathed by will, as, in the first instance, they are
tacitly entitled to their peculium
if they were not specifically deprived of it, and in the second, the heirs will
have the right to it, unless it was expressly left to the manumitted slave.
This rule of law is perfectly clear.
TITLE XXIV.
CONCERNING THE ABOLITION OF THE CLAUDIAN DECREE OF THE SENATE.
1. The Emperor Justinian to Hermogenus, Master of the Offices.
As We think that during oar reign (when We have exerted ourselves so greatly in
favor of the liberty of Our subjects) it would be extremely wicked for certain
women to be deprived of their freedom, and that from the lust of unprincipled
men there should result a state of affairs which could only be caused by the
ferocity of enemies in violation of natural law, We desire that the Claudian
Decree of the Senate, as well as all denunciations and legal decisions having
reference to the same, shall hereafter be abolished, so that any woman who is
free and has been deceived, or rendered the victim of unfortunate affection,
shall not, for this or any other reason, be reduced to slavery, and the liberty
to which she was entitled by birth lost; and the worst dishonor tarnish the
glory of her kindred, as she may, perhaps, have relatives of distinguished
rank, and the master under whose control she comes may be inferior to her
relatives. This rule shall also apply to freedmen, for the principles by which
My reign is governed do not suffer that a person who once has obtained freedom
shall, under any circumstances, be reduced to slavery for such a cause.
But to prevent slaves and serfs from thinking that they can go unpunished for
the commission of such acts (and this is especially provided in the case of
serfs in order that their condition may not be gradually changed through their
marriage with free women), We order that if anything of this kind should be
perpetrated by either a slave or a serf, his master shall have full authority,
either in his own person or by the Governor of the province, to administer
proper punishment to the said slave or serf, and separate him from the said
woman. If he should fail to do this, he is hereby notified that his own loss
will be the result of his neglect.


TITLE XXV.
CONCERNING THE ABOLITION OF THE MERE CIVIL RIGHT OF ROMANS.

1. The Emperor Justinian to Julianus, Prsetorian Prefect.
With the intention of abolishing by this law a ridiculous example of
the subtlety of the ancient jurists, We shall not hereafter permit any
distinction to be made between owners who hold property merely by the
civil right of Romans, and those who hold it as part of their own
possessions, for the reason that We do not wish this distinction to
exist any longer, as the term "Ex jure Quiritium"[[1]] is enigmatical, is
nowhere seriously considered, and does not strictly apply to property,
but is a phase void of meaning, and superfluous, and by it the minds
of youths who are beginning the study of the law are bewildered, and
they are compelled to learn the useless provisions of ancient
enactments. Therefore, anyone who is the owner of a slave, or of any
other property which belongs to him, shall become its full and lawful
proprietor.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% FOOTNOTE

[[1]] The Jus Quiritium was an indispensable requisite upon which the title to
property depended, and, in fact, the only one recognized in early times. Its
importance remained unimpaired after the exigencies of Roman life and
civilization had divided and subdivided the status of citizens and ownership
into various classes, and the application of its intricate and perplexing rules
seems to have puzzled some of the most learned jurists of both the Republic and
the Empire.
     
One man might sell an article to another, and if the usual formalities were not
observed, even if the price was paid and the property delivered, the complete
title did not pass ex jure Quiritium, and what was sold was considered to be
merely in bonis,or "among the effects" of the purchaser. This, of course, was
frequently productive of great hardship and injustice, so, by way of remedy, it
was provided by law that undisturbed possession for the term of a year in the
case of personal, and for two years in that of real property, perfected the
title of usucaption.

The civis optima jure was the Roman citizen par excellence, entitled to the Jus
Quiritium, as well as all other privileges implied by that distinguished
appellation, and to this invaluable right all other qualifications were rigidly
subordinated. Inheritance, the power of testamentary disposition, the exercise
of paternal authority, or patria potestas, marriage, capacity to hold public
office, usucaption, and, especially exemption from servitude, with the
unmolested enjoyment of the blessings of freedom, were all embraced in the Jus
Quiritium.ED.



TITLE XXVI.
CONCERNING USUCAPTION EITHER IN FAVOR OP THE PURCHASER OR ACQUIRED BY VIRTUE OF
THE TRANSACTION.

1. The Emperor Antoninus to Flavianus.
If your slaves have been stolen by persons who did not have the right to sell
them, you can bring suit to recover them, for they are not susceptible of
usucaption by the purchasers, as theft may be committed by an illegal sale.
Given on the day before the Idesof August, during the Consulate of Antoninus,
Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.

2. The Emperor Alexander to Marcellinus.
If the guardians, contrary to the intention of the deceased, sold the slaves
which he directed by his will to go to his heirs on account of their skill as
artisans, they cannot be acquired by usucaption.
Given on the fifth of the Nonesof March, during the Consulate of Julianus,
Consul for the second time, and Crispinus, 225.

3. The Same Emperor to Nepotilla.
If you purchased and now hold possession in good faith of the mother of him
with reference to whose condition you have instituted
legal proceedings, you can obtain by usucaption the child which she brought
forth afterwards while under your control, even if she herself formed part of
the stolen property.

4. The Same Emperor to Achilles.
If you establish that the other party gave his consent to the sale of the
female slave, and then rescinded the contract which he himself had ratified, he
shall not be heard. If, however, he cannot produce this proof, but can show
that the slave was purchased in good faith from a bona fidevendor, you can
acquire her by usucaption on the ground of lapse of time, and the attempt of
the claimant to hold the property will be of no avail.

5. The Emperor Gordian to Marinus.
When a possessor in bad faith sold a part of the property, the remainder which
he still retains can certainly, with all its profits, be recovered from him.
The portion which was sold, however, can only lawfully be demanded from the
possessor, where he knowingly bought what belonged to another, or when, as a
purchaser in good faith, he has not held it long enough to acquire usucaption.
Possession which has been lost by violence cannot be acquired by a purchaser
through usucaption, even though he bought it in good faith before it had again
come under the control of the owner.
6. The Emperor Philip to C&lius.
If it is proved that the property was pledged and afterwards sold by the
debtor, it is clear that, being, as it were, stolen, it cannot be acquired by
usucaption.
Without date or designation of Consulate.
7. The Same Emperor and Csesar to Compedius.
He who knowingly sells the slave of another without the consent of the owner
commits a theft, and this defect of title does not permit usucaption to take
place before the property is returned to the possession of the owner, even
though possession was obtained in good faith.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof February, during the Consulate of the Caesars,
248.
8. The Same Emperor and Csesar to Sevens.
Those who have a legal right to possession growing out of a compromise can
acquire property by usucaption.
9. The Same Emperor and Csesar to Gaius.
No kind of prescription will protect one who has purchased property sold by a
ward without the authority of his guardian, but if the ward is found to have
been benefited by the money of the purchaser, he will be barred by an exception
on the ground of bad faith if, after having arrived at puberty, he attempts to
rescind the contract by law on the ground that it is unjust.
Given during the Consulate of the Csesars.
TITLE XXVII.
CONCERNING THE USUCAPTION OF PROPERTY WHICH HAS BEEN DONATED.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Macedonius.
Whether the owner himself gave you the lands with reference to which you have
filed your petition, or whether you received them as a donation in good faith
from a person who was not their owner, you have acquired the right to them by
usucaption, and you cannot be deprived of what you have legally obtained.
Published on the fifth of the Ides of March, ....
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Capitonius.
There is no doubt that, in law, the rights of the master are not affected by
the donation of a female slave belonging to another, for a theft is committed
by the disposal of property without the consent of the owner, and usucaption of
such property cannot be acquired.
Ordered on the fifth of the Idesof April, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors.
3. The Same Emperors and the Csesars to Rhodamts.
No one is permitted to revoke a donation which has been lawfully made, but it
is also true that a mistake cannot be defended on the ground of good faith.
This rule applies where ownership is claimed on the ground of usucaption.
TITLE XXVIII.
CONCERNING USUCAPTION IN THE CASE OF A DOWRY. 1. The Emperor Alexander to
Taurinus.
When movable property is given by way of dowry, even though none of it belongs
to another, if there is no defect in the title, and it is accepted in good
faith, it can be acquired by usucaption as part of the dowry.
TITLE XXIX.
CONCERNING USUCAPTION WITH REFERENCE To AN HEIR.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Theophilus.
As usucaption, in this instance, does not apply to the heir, you are advised
that neither your mother, whose heir you are, nor you, yourself, can acquire
the slaves referred to, by usucaption.
Published at Rome, on the seventh of the Kalends ofJuly, during the Consulate
of Lsetus and Cerealis.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Maurina.
It has been established that nothing can be acquired through usucaption by some
one acting as heir, when there are any proper heirs.
3. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Diodorus.
The possession of the property of an absent person by anyone acting in the
capacity of heir will not authorize usucaption, if the report of the death of
the said person is false.
4. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Serapion.
Usucaption cannot be claimed except under a lawful title, nor can it be taken
advantage of, nor can it avail the possessor or the heir, nor will the right of
the owner be affected by lapse of time, even if property belonging to another
is claimed under the pretext of its having formed part of an estate.
Given on the seventh of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
TITLE XXX. GENERAL RULES WITH REFERENCE TO USUCAPTION.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Savinus.
Anyone who holds property under a lease, although he holds it corporeally, is
not considered to possess it in person, but for the owner, as prescription
based on long possession cannot be acquired by either a tenant or a lessee.
Published on the seventh of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of
Alexander, Consul for the fifth time, and Marcellus, 227.
2. The Same Emperor to Onesima.
You say that sometime ago you purchased the slave with reference to whom you
petition, but, if you reflect, you will remember that property belonging to My
Treasury cannot be acquired by usucaption, and you are hereby notified that you
will be compelled to answer in any actions brought by My Treasury, nor can the
owership of the slave in question be acquired by you through usucaption, unless
he was not born of a female slave belonging to the Treasury.
Published during the Nonesof March, during the Consulate of Pompeianus and
Pelignus.
3. The Emperor Philip and the Csesar to Pantinus.
If Antiochus knowingly held your slave in bad faith, he cannot be acquired by
usucaption by his successor, even though he may possess him in good faith,
because of the original defect in the title.
TITLE XXXI.
CONCERNING THE TRANSFER OP THE RIGHT OP USUCAPTION AND THE ABOLITION OP THE
DISTINCTION OP RES MANCIPI AND RES NEC MANCIPI.
1. The Emperor Justinian to John, Praetorian Prefect.
As We, by Our care, have disposed of the name and substance of acquisitions ex
jure Quiritium,and have provided that ordinary prescription shall be valid
everywhere, whether it arises from possession for ten, twenty, or thirty years,
or even for a much longer time, it would be useless to admit the right of
usucaption only with reference to property situated in Italy, and to exclude it
from application to that situated in the provinces. Where, however, anyone has
had in his possession in good faith, for the term of two years, property
belonging to another, which is situated in Italy, the unfortunate owner of the
same shall lose his right to it, and shall be entitled to no recourse with
reference to said property, which was lost without the knowledge of the said
owner, for which reason there is nothing more unjust than for him, who is
ignorant of the fact, to be deprived of his possession in so short a time.
Therefore, We order by the present law, that where property situated in Italy
is either immovable, or is understood to be such, the term of usucaption shall
be extended (like that for a year), so that it will now run with those of ten,
twenty, or thirty years, and others of still longer duration, and that the
present limited period shall be abolished.
Moreover, as the ancients fixed the time for the acquisition of movable
property, or that which was capable of moving itself, or which was, in any way
retained (of course when held in good faith), whether situated in Italy or
anywhere else in the world, and allowed ownership to vest after possession for
a year, We consider that this should be amended, so that where anyone has had
possession in good faith of any movable property, or of any which was capable
of moving itself, either in Italy, or in any of the provinces, for the
continuous term of three years, he can acquire a legal title to the same, just
as if it had been acquired by usucaption, it being only observed that in all
such cases he must, in the first place, obtain it in good faith, just as is
required by a prescription of long time, and that the possession acquired by
any preceding lawful possessor shall be included in the term of ten, twenty, or
thirty years.
We decree that, in the case of movable property, the legal retention of the
preceding holder under a just right of possession, which he exercised over the
said property, shall not be interrupted by the fact that the subsequent holder
may have been aware that the property belonged to another, even though it was
obtained under a lucrative title. The time has been extended by this law with
reference to the usucaption of property which is the subject of the same, and
We have limited that of usucaption, productive of such loss and injury to
owners, and abolished the ancient practice of dividing property into
mancipi,and
nee mancipi,which is only in conformity with reason, so that a similar rule may
apply to all property and all localities, and useless ambiguities and
differences be finally disposed of.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof November, after the
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
TITLE XXXII.
CONCERNING THE ACQUISITION AND RETENTION OF POSSESSION.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus, and the Csesars, to Atticus.
It is established by the principles of public convenience, as well as by those
of law, that possession can be acquired by anyone without his knowledge,
through another who is free; and that usucaption will begin to run as soon as
he becomes aware of the fact.
Published on the sixth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of
Fuscus and Dexter, 226.
2. The Emperor Alexander to Maurus.
He who has caused you anxiety is not well informed when he asserts that you did
not obtain possession of the property which you purchased through an agent, as
you yourself allege that you have been in possession of the same for a long
time, and have, as the owner, transacted all the business relating to it; for
although transfer of the property whose possession has been delivered to you
was not mentioned in the instrument, you, nevertheless, in fact acquired it if
the vendor knew that you were in possession.
3. The Emperor Decius to Rufinus.
The possession of property donated by anyone to an infant is actually acquired,
for although the opinions of legal authorities differ on this point, still it
is more proper to hold that, in the meantime, possession is acquired by
delivery, although the infant is not capable of giving his full consent to the
transaction. For otherwise, in accordance with the opinion of the most learned
jurist Papinian, possession could not be acquired by the infant through his
guardian.
Published on the fifth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Decius,
Consul for the fifth time, and Gratus, 251.
4. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Nepotianus.
Although possession cannot be acquired by mere intention, still it can be
retained in this way. Therefore, if you have failed to cultivate your land for
a certain time, not with the intention of relinquishing possession, but only
because of fear, your rights cannot be prejudiced on account of the time which
has elapsed.
Published during the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Diocletian,
Consul for the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third time, 290.
5. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Menno.
As no one can change his own title to possession, and you allege that the
tenant, without any external cause arising, allowed the farm which he unjustly
occupied to be sold, the Governor of the province, after having ascertained the
truth, will not permit you to be deprived of your right of ownership.
6. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Valerius.
If the Governor of the province should ascertain that your field or your
vineyard has been seized without good reason by the person whom you mentioned,
and that your claim is not barred by any prescription, he will not hesitate to
restore to you possession of the land with all its appurtenances.
Ordered during the Idesof April, during the Consulate of the above-mentioned
Emperors.
7. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Asyncritus.
Unjust possession does not confer a valid title upon the possessor. Wherefore
it is certain that anyone who takes possession of the land of another, without
the consent of the owner, or of his agent who has authority to transfer it,
cannot obtain legal ground for possession of the same.
Published on the fifth of the Idesof December, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
8. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Cyrillus.
It has been decided on the ground of the public welfare that the ownership, as
well as the possession of property, can be acquired through an agent, as the
two cannot be separated.
Published on the eighteenth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
9. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Sergius.
A purchaser cannot legally hold possession of property which he occupied on his
own responsibility by virtue of a genuine sale, and much less does he who,
falsely representing himself as the purchaser, for the reason that he lent
money without the obligation of a pledge and seized the land of another, have
just cause to retain it.
Published on the third of the Nonesof April, ....
10. The Emperor Constantine to Maternus.
No one can entertain any doubt that there are two grounds of possession, one
based on the law, and the other on the fact; and both of them are legal when
they are confirmed by the silence and want of opposition of all adversaries.
Where, however, a controversy arises, he cannot be considered the possessor
who, although he may have actual possession of the property, still his right to
occupy it having been questioned, a contest has been begun, and the case
brought into court.
Published on the eleventh of the Kalendsof February, under the Consulate of
Volusianus and Annianus, 314.
11. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Petroneus, Lieutenant of the Spains.
Previous defects of possession are transferred by former owners, and the
imperfection of the original proprietor passes to his successor.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of Csesarius
and Atticus, 397.
12. The Emperor Justinian to John, Praetorian Prefect.
We, intending to dispose of the question which has been brought to Our
attention by the works of the Sabinians, hereby order that, if either a slave,
an agent, a tenant, a lessee, or anyone else through whom we are permitted to
hold possession has, either through negligence or fraud, abandoned or delivered
to another the actual occupation of any property which he held, so that the
said third party may have ground for obtaining possession of the same, no
prejudice whatever can result to the owner, nor can any injury be inflicted
upon him by the malignity of his representative, but the latter, if he is free,
will be liable to suitable actions at law, and all loss must be made good by
him to the owner of said property, or to him with reference to whom he has
acted negligently or fraudulently.
But where possession has not yet been acquired by the said agent, tenant,
lessee, or slave, but the latter, through negligence or fraud, has failed to
secure it, then the person himself who appointed him shall suffer the damage
resulting from his bad selection of the individual directed to take possession
of the property, and attributable either to the evil design or negligence of
the latter.
We also order that the owner shall only be entitled to redress when he has
sustained any injury through the agency of him whom he appointed, but not when
he has failed to reap any benefit through his acts, as the ancient rule of law
which states that the condition of a master can, under no circumstances, be
made worse through the conduct of his slave, only applies when he suffers
actual loss, and not when he unsuccessfully attempts to obtain some advantage
for himself by means of his slave. In this instance, all legal rights of action
are reserved for the owner of the property, or for him who appointed any of the
above-mentioned persons to hold possession, as against the latter, if he is
entitled to the same under the law.
TITLE XXXIII.
CONCERNING THE PRESCRIPTION OP LONG TIME BASED UPON OCCUPANCY FOR TEN OR TWENTY
YEARS.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Julian, Prsstorian Prefect.
If, after the question of possession has been disposed of, the ownership of the
property passes in good faith to another, and remains
in his possession without any interruption for the term of twenty years, the
party then in possession should not be disturbed, but if the latter does not
take advantage of the occupancy of the former owner, there is nothing to
prevent him from being disturbed by a dispute as to the title. If, however, the
right of the former possessor was disputed, even though he remained in
possession for a long time without interruption, he will, nevertheless, not be
able to avail himself of prescription based on long time.
This rule also must be observed with reference to property belonging to the
State.
Extract from Novel 119, Chapter VII. Latin Text.
Where a possessor in bad faith alienates property, prescription based upon long
time will not apply if the true owner is ignorant of his rights, and the
alienation has been made, but his defence will be valid in case he acted in
good faith, and the period of thirty years has elapsed. But where he who knew
that the property belonged to him did not prosecute his claim in court within
ten years, if the parties were present, and within twenty if they wer.e absent,
the possessor being protected by prescription, will be entitled to hold the
property.
Extract from the Same Novel, Chapter Vill. Latin Text.
Where, however, one of the parties was present during certain years, and absent
during others, there must be added to the ten years out of the other ten as
many as he was absent.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars.
The prescription of long time can usually only benefit those who, after having
obtained possession of property in good faith, have enjoyed it continuously,
without its being interrupted by legal proceedings.
Published on the fifth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of
Maximus, Consul for the second time, and Aquilinus, 286.
3. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Antoninus.
If the vineyard which your mother gave to your step-father by way of dowry
belonged to you, and no prescription has arisen oh account of lapse of time,
the Governor of the province must cause it to be restored to you.
4. The Same Emperors and Csssars to Hermogenes.
Long-continued possession which has been acquired only by the right of
succession, and without any legal title can, for this reason alone, be of no
advantage in claiming prescription.
Given on the fourth of the Idesof April, during the Consulate of the Emperors.
5. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Sotericus.It is a perfectly clear rule of
law that anyone who claims ownership from one who is indebted to some mistake
alone for his possession of
certain property to which he holds a legal title cannot be excluded by
prescription of long time.
Ordered on the eleventh of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of the
Emperors.
6. Extract from a Letter of the Same Emperors and Csesars to Primosus, Governor
of Syria.
If the sale was fraudulently and deceitfully made, even though the parties were
over twenty-five years of age, the time which has elapsed cannot confirm it, as
the prescription of long time does not apply to contracts entered into in bad
faith.
7. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Anthea.
The loss of documents does not legally prejudice the right of persons whose
title is protected by long possession, nor can the evil designs of another
disturb security acquired by long-continued possession.
Given on the day before the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
8. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Celsus.
If he against whom you petitioned alleges that the slaves of your late mother
belonged to him as her adopted son, the fact of an illegal adoption is not
alone sufficient to enable him to acquire the ownership of the property, for
which reason you will not be prevented from claiming the slaves, without being
under any apprehension that prescription can be successfully pleaded against
you, if he, against whom you have filed your petition, only obtained possession
of the said slaves under the title above mentioned.
9. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Demosthenes.
A purchaser in good faith, who pleaded an exception against the prescription of
ten years advanced by the other party who was present during that time, from
the beginning of the controversy, and who proved this after the plaintiff had
disclosed his claim, has shown that he has a right to legal possession, and
very properly asks to be released from liability.
10. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Rheginus.
The prescription of long time cannot benefit those who have obtained possession
in good faith, after being in default in joining issue, because the time should
be reckoned after legal proceedings have been instituted.
11. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Prsetorian Prefect.
We directly order that, with reference to prescription of long time, and which
is based upon occupancy for either ten or twenty years, that where anyone is
proved to have held possession of property for either ten or twenty years,
which property has been acquired by
donation, or by any other lucrative title, and the time it was occupied by the
former possessor is added to that during which he held it, he will undoubtedly
be entitled to the above-mentioned prescription of long time, nor can he be
excluded on the ground that he acquired the property by a lucrative title.
Given during the Kalendsof June, under the Consulate of Our Lord Justinian,
528.
12. The Same Emperor to John, Praetorian Prefect.
Three difficulties arose among the ancient authorities concerning prescription
based upon long time: the first, with reference to where the property was
situated; the second, relating to the persons, whether the presence of one or
of both should be required; and the third, whether the claimant as well as the
possessor should be in the same province, or even in the same city where the
property was in dispute; and We shall include all these matters in the present
law, so that no doubt may remain on the subject. Therefore We decree that, in
cases of this kind, the domicile of the claimant as well as that of the
possessor shall be taken into account, so that he who raised the question of
the ownership or of the hypothecation of the property, as well as he who is in
possession, must reside in the same place, that is to say, in the same
province. For We think that We should decide in favor of considering the
province rather than the city as the domicile of the parties, and if both of
them have their domicile in the same province, the case will be considered as
having arisen between them while present, and any longer prescription than that
of ten years will be excluded.
Moreover, with reference to the doubt arising concerning the property, there
shall be no distinction whether it is situated in the same province, or in a
neighboring one, or whether it is situated beyond seas or even in a far distant
country.
If, however, both parties should not reside in the same province, but one
should have his domicile in one province, and the other in another, then the
case will be one as between absent parties, and the prescription of twenty
years shall apply, for there is nothing to prevent the action with reference to
the property, whether it is situated in one province or in another, from being
brought in a provincial court, and still less to prevent this being done in
this Most Flourishing City. For what advantage would it be for possession to be
held in one province or another, as the right to claim property is incorporeal,
and wherever it is situated, the ownership of the same can revert to the owner
or the creditor? Hence our ancestors, with great shrewdness, and with a species
of divine inspiration, established the rule that rights of action existed
wherever the claims or^ the property itself could be situated.
Therefore, after the promulgation of this law, let no one doubt what should be
decided, whether the parties are present or absent; for if the occupant
acquired possession in good faith in the beginning, and the domicile of both
parties is ascertained, then let the question
be determined, no matter where the property may be situated, without taking
into consideration either knowledge or ignorance, in order that no other
embarrassing occasion for doubt may arise.
The same rule must be observed if the property is not attached to the soil, but
is incorporeal and consists merely of rights, as, for instance, usufructs and
other servitudes.
TITLE XXXIV.
To WHAT CASES PRESCRIPTION OF LONG TIME DOES NOT
APPLY.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Marcellina.
If he to whom you have given your land for the purpose of cultivation
afterwards, through the agency of your step-mother, secretly removed the
documents by which it could be proved that the ownership of the land belonged
to you, he cannot defend himself on the ground of long possession alone.
2. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Dionysius.It is superfluous to have
recourse to the prescription of long time in matters relating to the ownership
of slaves.
3. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Apollinarus.
One of two joint-owners, who has possession of all the common undivided
property, cannot plead prescription of long time to prevent the other joint-
owner from claiming his share of the property, or for bringing suit in
partition; as neither the action in partition, nor that brought for the
division of property owned in common, is barred by the prescription of long
time.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of the Csesars.
4. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Libroa.
The prescription of long time does not injure those who are claiming an estate.
None of the provisions of this law, however, shall prejudice the rights of
those who do not hold possession of property which belongs, or has belonged to
an estate, either as heirs or possessors, but have obtained it by purchase,
gift, or some other title, as the succession cannot be demanded by them.
Given on the third of the Idesof September ....
5. The Same Emperors and Caesars to Hosimus.
If you have cared for a boy slave who had not been abandoned, but had been
wounded by the enemy, and you did this at your own expense (as you assert)
believing him to be free, you cannot legally plead the prescription of long
time to prevent his master from recovering him, provided he tenders you the
amount which you have legitimately expended in his behalf.
TITLE XXXV.
IN WHAT CASES PRESCRIPTION OF LONG TIME CANNOT BE PLEADED.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Venuleius.
The time passed in an expedition cannot be included in pleading prescription
against a claim for land, if it can be legally established.
Given on the sixth of the Nonesof July, under the Consulate of Julian and
Crispus, 225.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian and the Caesars to Aurelius, Chief
Physician.
As you assert that, during your absence, those of whom you complain seized your
property, and it is clear that you could not leave Our retinue on account of
your profession as a physician, Our Praetorian Prefect, after summoning all the
parties interested, will decide between you. It is not necessary for you to
request that prescription based on lapse of time shall not be pleaded against
you, since the fact that you were lawfully absent, and engaged in the public
service, will protect you from damage in this respect.
Published at Nicea, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof March, during the
Consulate of Maximus, Consul for the fifth time, and Aquilinus, 286.
3. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Numidius, Governor of Italy.
It is well known that time passed in minority cannot be included in
prescription, for the latter only begins to run when the owner of the property
attains his majority.
Published on the fourth of the Idesof September, during the Consulate of
Diocletian, Consul for the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third
time, 290.
4. The Same Emperors and Caesars to Crispinus.
If uninterrupted possession has continued without dispute, you have a right to
plead prescription. We, however, decree that it shall never be valid against
persons who are absent on business for the State, and especially where this
takes place unexpectedly.
Published on the sixth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of
Ambalianus and Asclepiodotus, 292.
5. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Januarius.
It is a positive rule of law that prescription cannot be pleaded in suits
growing out of loans for consumption, or for use, or deposits, legacies,
trusts, guardianships, or in any other personal action.
Ordered on the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of the above-mentioned
Emperors.
6. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Dulcius.Having been taken captive by the
enemy, and returned under the right of postliminium,you have no reason to
apprehend that the pos-
session of your adversary based upon long time can be legally pleaded in a
direct action in rem,or in any other which you may bring for the purpose of
recovering your ownership of the property, as an act of this kind is of no
avail against those who, for any reason, have the right to invoke the aid of
restitution.
7. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Cassander.
Possessors of property in good faith are protected by prescription against
those who have been present for ten years, or have been absent for twenty. If
the relief of restitution is demanded by anyone with reference to a share of
the plaintiffs, as much of the time should be deducted as would usually be
counted in case anything had been done, and the remainder should be computed,
which is reasonable.
8. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Prsetorian Prefect.
We order that, exclusively in the case of soldiers who are engaged in
expeditions only, that time which has elapsed during the expedition shall be
pleaded in opposition to prescription, but this privilege shall not be enjoyed
by them, so far as the time which they may have passed either at home, or in
other places, while they were not in active service, is concerned.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of
Decius, 529.
TITLE XXXVI.
WHERE PRESCRIPTION is PLEADED AGAINST A CREDITOR.
1. The Emperor Gordian to Veneria.
Unbroken silence is strengthened by the prescription of long time, and renders
an action brought by creditors for the recovery of a pledge of no effect, when
the debtors, or those who have succeeded to their rights, have possession of
the property pledged. When, however, prescription of long time is pleaded by a
possessor against his creditor, a personal action will lie in favor of the
latter against the debtor.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Marcella.
If you were not the heir of a debtor, but obtained the property as a donation,
and have had lawful possession of the same for the term of twenty years, the
rule of law does not permit a personal action to be brought against you (for
the reason that you did not succeed the debtor), nor can you be deprived of
land given in pledge after the necessary time has elapsed, even when
prescription based upon ten years occupancy can be pleaded against creditors,
who have been present, a principle which has not only been established by Our
Rescripts but also by those of the Emperors, Our predecessors.
TITLE XXXXXXVVIIII..CONCERNING THE PRESCRIPTION OF FORTY YEARS.
1. The Emperor Constantine to Orphitus.
It is well known that no question can be raised by the Treasury with reference
to property which has no owner, after continuous occupancy of the same for the
term of forty years.
2. The Emperor Zeno to ^Eneas, Count of Private Affairs.We order that when
persons who have purchased any property, whether it be movable, immovable, or
capable of moving itself, or which consists of rights of action, or of any
other rights whatsoever, from Our Most Sacred Treasury, or, where any movable
or immovable property, or any capable of moving itself, or any rights of
action, or any other rights whatsover, have been given to them by the
munificence of the Emperor, they shall be entitled to all the privileges to be
obtained from the divine laws of the Emperor Leo, of illustrious memory, and
from Our own, as well, with reference to certain estates, in preference to
purchasers, and that all of them shall enjoy benefits or privileges of this
description, just as if they had already been, or may hereafter be granted, in
the case of individual property or inheritances.
Nor can any suits for the ownership of property, or on account of its
hypothecation, or any civil, praetorian, or personal action based upon laws or
Imperial Constitutions, or any other statutory provisions whatsoever (even
though they may not be expressly enumerated in the present law), be brought
against the purchasers of the property aforesaid, whether they already are, or
may subsequently become such, or against those who, in the case of property of
this kind, have been the recipients of Our generosity, or who may become such
hereafter. Permission is, however, given to those who desire to do so, to
institute proceedings against Our Treasury within the term of forty years, but
after the said term has elapsed, they are advised that they will not be allowed
to bring any actions whatsoever against it.
(1) With a view to the consideration of the rights of purchasers of property
from the Treasury, We decree that whenever a person competent to sell such
property states in writing that he has received the price of the same,
purchasers who have paid money shall not, under such circumstances, be molested
on the ground of non-payment, nor shall the said purchasers be required to
prove that the price was paid, even though they may not have obtained the
security of a receipt for the same. But, as it is in the power of him who
receives the price not to give a receipt at a time when it was not paid, so it
is proper that purchasers should enjoy perfect security by the payment of the
price in this manner, and not be obliged to furnish other proof, as has already
been stated.
3. The Emperor Justinian to Florus, Count of Private Affairs.It was very
properly provided by the Emperor Zeno, of Divine Memory, in the case of fiscal
alienations, that persons who obtain
property from Our Treasury by way of donation, purchase, or any other kind of
alienationif anything should arise to impugn the validity of the contract,
either on the ground of eviction, or to produce any other annoyance with
reference to the ownership or hypothecation of the propertyshall not suffer
any loss; and that no suits can be brought against the purchasers, or those who
have received the property by way of donation, or who have possession of the
same under any other title; but they can only be brought against the Treasury
within the term of four years, which, having elapsed, no action will lie
against the Treasury.
We know that this rule is constantly observed in fiscal alienations, but that
it is not observed in the case of property acquired from private resources of
the Emperor, and not from the funds of the Treasury. This is unreasonable, for
why should such a difference be established when everything is understood to
belong to the Emperor, and what is alienated is derived from his private
property, or from that belonging to the Treasury?
In like manner, when anything is alienated by the Empress, why should it not
enjoy the same privilege? Our stewards, by whom We are accustomed to administer
Our estates when anything is sold, are required to attach to the bills of sale
agreements with reference to eviction, and others having a view to private
convenience, and to acknowledge obligations of this kind in instruments
relating to alienations, as well as those concerning changes or compromises,
where such transactions take place. This also refers to those who do not
acknowledge the Imperial Majesty, nor realize what a distance exists between
private fortune and Imperial rank, but attempt to injure and cause loss to Our
stewards, by whom the affairs of the Imperial household are conducted.
For the purpose of correcting all these things, We order by this general rule,
which shall be valid for all time, that every alienation proceeding from the
Imperial Palace, whether it is made by Us or by Her August Majesty the Empress,
or by those who may hereafter be worthy of the Imperial Namewhether the
property has already been alienated, or may be alienated hereaftershall remain
irrevocable; whether the transfer has been made by Us in person, or by Our
agents in pursuance of Our authority. And let no one be so bold as to bring
suit against those who acquire such property under any title whatsoever,
whether the said property be movable, immovable, or capable of moving itself,
or whether it consists of incorporeal rights or civil privileges, or think that
there is any way open for him to molest them, but every avenue shall be closed,
and every method of procedure, and every hope of the tolerance of such
malignancy, shall be excluded.
They shall, however, have the right to bring actions in remor hypothecary
actions against Us within the term of four years, as they can do against the
Treasury, if they think that they are entitled to such actions; and such a
cause shall proceed by Our order and be decided in the proper manner. When,
however, the said term of four
years has elapsed, no one will be entitled to bring any suit whatsoever against
Us. Therefore, because We know that not only We, Ourselves, but also Our
Illustrious Consort, the Empress, has already given, sold, and alienated much
property in other ways, and that Our liberality, as well as that of Our
Illustrious Consort, the Empress, has been, above all, displayed with reference
to churches, hospitals, poorhouses, as well as bishops, monks, and innumerable
other persons, We order that they also shall hold by an indisputable title what
they have acquired, and that no proceeding shall be instituted against them,
and that, within the term of four years from the present time, they shall all
have a right to bring suit against Us to recover said property; but they are
hereby notified that, after the said term of four years has expired, they shall
be entitled to no recourse against Us. For as Imperial rank is entitled to many
privileges, all Imperial donations shall be irrevocable, without being
recorded, and the title to any property which the Illustrious Emperor may have
given to his August Consort temporarily, or during marriage, or which he
himself may have received from his Illustrious Consort, the Empress, as a
donation, shall immediately become complete, without being subject to
confirmation by time, and this shall be considered an Imperial privilege. For
why should those who, giving their advice and their efforts, toil day and night
for the benefit of the entire world, not enjoy privileges becoming their rank?
Therefore, Your Excellency, as well as all Our other judges, shall cause these
provisions to be observed which We have promulgated for the honor of the
Imperial Name, and for the security of those who have experienced Our bounty,
and which shall be valid from the time when, by the Divine Will, We assumed the
Imperial insignia.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifth of the Kalendsof December, after the
fifth Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 581.
TITLE XXXVIII.
THE CLAIM TO PROPERTY BELONGING TO THE CROWN, OR
TO THAT BELONGING TO THE TEMPLES, SHALL NOT BE
BARRED BY PRESCRIPTION.
1. The Emperors Valens and Valentinian to Probus, Praetorian Prefect of Gaul.
It has repeatedly been ordered that freedmen and serfs attached to the Imperial
domain, as well as their offspring and other descendants, who have left Our
land and engaged in other different occupations, shall be restored to Our
estates and stripped of any dignity which they may have fraudulently obtained,
and shall not be permitted to avail themselves of any prescription.
2. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Dexter, Count of
Private Affairs.
We order that all lands held by tenants or under emphyteusis, and which are the
property of the State or the Emperor, or belong
173
to the sacred temples, or have been sold in any province, or alienated in
pursuance of any other contract, by persons who had possession of them
wrongfully and contrary to law, shall be restored; and that no prescription can
be pleaded against their restoration, so that those who have purchased them
legally cannot demand the repayment of the price of the same.1
Given at Constantinople, on the fifth of the Nonesof July, during the Consulate
of Valentinian, Consul for the fourth time, and Eutro-pius, 387.
3. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Paulus, Count of the Imperial Domain.
If anyone should have the boldness to take possession of land forming part of
the Imperial Domain, its rights shall be recovered in accordance with the
provisions of the ancient census. Therefore Your Highness should not pay any
more attention to rescripts which have been fraudulently obtained than to
prescription of long time, or to the new census; and hence you must restore
everything which has been taken away to its proper place, for temporary
possession or a new return cannot abolish the privilege enjoyed by Our
property.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Arcadius,
Consul for the fifth time, and Honorius, Consul for the third time, 396.
TITLE XXXIX.
CONCERNING THE PRESCRIPTION OP THIRTY AND FORTY
YEARS.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Ariana.
As you allege that, during your absence, certain persons who coveted your lands
purposely caused them to be sold at a low price, by the Governor of the
province, under the pretext of the collection of taxes, if the lawful time from
the day of the sale within which you can claim said land has passed, the
Governor of the province shall take cognizance of your case, and shall decide
whatever the law directs.
If, however, the time prescribed by law from the day of the public sale has not
yet elapsed, the judge, having examined your allegations, shall decide what the
nature of the case requires, being aware that if he should ascertain the sale
to be unjust, the price paid under a fraudulent contract of this kind must be
returned to the purchaser, in accordance with the tenor of the Imperial
Constitutions.
2. The Emperor Valens and Valentinian to Volusianus, Prastorian Prefect.
Improper action is taken with reference to the owners of land when such a
precarious title is granted to possessors that they cannot be molested for any
cause after the lapse of forty years, as the law
1 "Nullum tempus aut locus occurrit regi."ED.
of Constantine provides that no other title whatever shall be required by
possessors who have held property for themselves but not for others. It is
established that those shall not be designated possessors who occupy property
on the condition of the payment of a certain fixed sum as rent. Therefore, no
one who has obtained possession as a lessee, by retaining the property of
another for a long time, can obtain the ownership of the same for himself; for
otherwise, the owners might lose the land which they have leased, or be obliged
to exclude valuable tenants, or to publicly proclaim their ownership every
year. Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of
Valens and Valentinian, 365.
3. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Asclepiodotus, Pree-torian Prefect.
The right to bring special actions in rem,or general personal actions, cannot
be extended beyond the term of thirty years. When any property or right is
claimed, or anyone has a suit or a prosecution of any kind brought against him,
the prescription of thirty years can be pleaded against the plaintiff.
The same law is applicable in the case of a person who endeavors to recover
property which has been pledged or hypothecated, not from his debtor, but from
another who has had it in his possession for a long time; therefore, where
actions have not been brought within thirty year's from the time in which this
could be done, they cannot longer be prosecuted. Nor will it be sufficient to
obtain a special and favorable answer, even though this be secured by personal
application and petition to the Emperor, or even to state this in court,
unless, after the Imperial Rescript has been mentioned, or the demand formally
made, an agreement has been effected through a bailiff, nor can a defence based
on infirmity of sex, or on absence, or service in the army, be set up in
opposition to this law, but only on the ground of the minority of the
defendant, even though he may be represented by his guardian.
For, after persons who have been subject to the care of a curator become of
age, their rights, as well as those of others, must necessarily be dependent
upon possession for the term of thirty years. Rights of action, considered
perpetual, are extinguished by the prescription cf thirty continuous years, but
not those which were limited in former times to a certain term.
We decree that, after this period has elapsed, no one shall have the power to
proceed, even if he should attempt to excuse himself by professing ignorance of
the law.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of
Victor.
4. The Emperor Anastasius to Matronianus, Prsetorian Prefect.
We, desiring to permanently dispose of every opportunity to cause injury, do
decree that all prescriptions having reference to time, which are derived from
the ancient laws or from Imperial decrees, shall
endure in full force, just as if they had been specifically and definitely
enumerated in this law; and those who now have a right to avail themselves of
them, or may in the future acquire such a right, shall, in accordance with
their tenor, be able to do so for all time hereafter.
And wishing to supplement what may have been omitted, either in words or
meaning in prescriptions formerly in force, We order, by this law (which shall
be valid for all time) that if there should be any contract or action which has
not been expressly provided for by the rules governing the prescriptions above
mentioned which, by means of either an accidental or an intentional
interpretation, appears to afford means to evade the restrictions imposed by
the prescriptions aforesaid, it shall be included in this Our most salutary
law, and it shall, unquestionably, be extinguished after the lapse of forty
years, and no private or public action relating to any cause or person which
has been extinguished by the silence of the aforesaid forty years shall be
brought.
Anyone, however, who, under some title which has been undisputed during the
above-mentioned period, has had possession of property without any judicial
controversy having been raised with reference to it, still holds the same,
shall remain secure in its ownership; and any slave who, after the expiration
of said term, without having his case submitted to judicial investigation, has
obtained an advantage of this kind, shall become free under the provisions of
this most salutary law.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Kalendsof . . . , during the
Consulate of Olybrius.
5. The Same Emperor to Thomas, Prsetorian Prefect of Illyria.
We do not permit the prescription of forty years to be pleaded by those who are
called to the office of decurion, but We order that they shall always be-
compelled to remain in the civil condition in which they were born. For the law
which We have promulgated applies to other conditions, and former constitutions
are not repealed by the said new law, which plainly directs that decurions and
their children shall be returned to their former status without reference to
any prescription whatsoever.
6. The Same Emperor to Leo, Prsetorian Prefect.
We, having ascertained that certain persons have attempted to apply the
Imperial Constitutions which treats of the prescription of forty years to the
prejudice of the payment of public contributions, alleging that if anyone had
failed to pay anything for that time or longer, or had paid less than he
should, he would be released from liability for taxes, and that they cannot be
collected or he be compelled to pay them, as an attempt of this kind is well
known to be contrary to both the spirit and the letter of Our law, We,
therefore, order that those who have had possession of any property
continuously for the term of forty years, without any lawful interruption,
shall not, in any way, be deprived of the possession or ownership of the said
property, but that they can be compelled to pay any public tax imposed upon
them by the civil law, and that no prescription of any time can be pleaded in a
case of this description.
7. The Emperor Justin to Archelaus, Praetorian Prefect.
As it is a well-known rule of law that an hypothecary action is extinguished
after the lapse of thirty years, so far as foreign possessors of the encumbered
property are concerned, if the silence is not interrupted as provided by law,
that is to say, by an agreement, or where the incapacity of one of the parties
who has not arrived at the age of puberty is demonstrated, he will have
recourse against the debtors or heirs of the possessors, either immediate or
remote, who will not be entitled to take advantage of any prescription.
We have taken occasion to amend this law, to prevent possessors of this kind
from being subject to constant apprehension.
(1) Therefore, We order that the right to bring the hypothecary action on the
ground of property remaining in the hands of debtors or their heirs shall not
be extended beyond the term of forty years within which said action can be
brought, unless some agreement has been made, or the minority of the party
enjoying the right is involved (as has already been stated), so that the
difference existing between the actions brought against the debtor or his heir,
and against strangers, for the recovery of the property, shall only consist in
the number of years, but that the two shall be similar in all other respects.
With reference to personal actions, those rules shall be observed which have
been prescribed by former constitutions.
(2) But as the question frequently arose in judicial controversies as to
whether a creditor claiming prior rights could, after the lapse of thirty
years, molest a subsequent creditor, who had possession of the land under
hypothecation, the latter being the representative of the debtor, and holding
possession like him, We hav^e considered it necessary to dispose of it. Hence,
We order that while a common debtor is living, the prescription of thirty years
cannot be pleaded against a prior creditor, but that there will be ground for
the prescription of forty years, because, while the debtor is living, the prior
creditor should reasonably think that the subsequent creditor holds possession
of the property for and in the name of the common debtor. And therefore, if the
debtor should die, the subsequent creditor having possession in his name can,
with good reason, plead prescription of thirty years.
In accordance with this distinction, the computation of time should be made in
such a way that the prescription of the subsequent creditor will date from the
death of the debtor. If, however, he should wish to add the time during which
he had possession after the death of the debtor to that which he had during the
lifetime of the latter, or while the common debtor himself had possession, then
the rights conferred by prescription of forty years must be considered, and the
subsequent creditor must show that he had possession for a term sufficient to
complete the period of forty years, by which the debtor himself would have been
able to exclude him, in his turn.
(3) The same rule must be observed in the computation of time, where the
subsequent creditor is ready to tender payment of the debt to the prior
creditor, and the latter attempts to bar him by pleading the prescription of
long possession.
(4) It is more than manifest that, in all contracts in which either promises or
agreements are entered into subject to any condition, depending upon a fixed,
or indefinite time, after the condition has been fulfilled, or the certain or
uncertain time has elapsed, the prescription of thirty or forty years, which is
pleaded in personal or hypothecary actions, begins to run.
The result of this is that in marriages, in which the restitution of the dowry
is provided for, or in the case of ante-nuptial donations, in which it is
customary to specify the indefinite date of death or divorce, after the
dissolution of marriage, the prescription which can be pleaded in personal as
well as in hypothecary actions, begins to
run.
(5) Moreover, there is no doubt that if any one of those to whom something is
due holds property which has been hypothecated to him without the employment of
violence, an interruption of prescription takes place by means of this
possession, if less than thirty or forty years has passed; and much more is
this the case, if the interruption was caused by an agreement, as such
possession bears a resemblance to the joinder of issue.
If one of the debtors should give his creditor additional security for the
purpose of securing his obligation, the time of the abovementioned prescription
will be considered as having been interrupted, so far as the original security
is concerned, and the prescription in both personal and hypothecary actions
will run from the date of the novation; for it would be dishonorable for the
debtor to dispute this, in order to avoid his liability to his creditor, after
having given him a second security for the former debt.
(6) With reference to promises, legacies, and other obligations which require
the giving or payment of something every year, or every month, or at any other
prescribed date, it is clear that the times of the above-mentioned prescription
should not be computed from the date of such an obligation, but from the
beginning of each year, or each month, or from any other time which may be
specified.
Moreover, permission should not be given to anyone who has held any property
under emphyteutical right, for the term of forty, or any other number of years,
who alleges that he is entitled to ownership of the said property, to acquire
the same on account of the time which has elapsed; as what is granted under
emphyteutical right must always remain in the same condition, since the lessee,
or the agent who has charge of the business of another, is obliged to restore
the said property to the owner, if he wishes him to do so, even though he may
allege that he is not obliged to surrender it, and is entitled to possession of
the same by prescription, after the expiration of a certain
time.
Given during the Kalendsof December, ....
8. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Prsetorian Prefect.
When anyone has held possession of any property which was obtained in good
faith by purchase, agreement, donation, or any other contract, for ten or
twenty years, and has acquired for himself the right of prescription based on
long time, against the owners of said property, or creditors who claim that
they are entitled to it through hypothecation, and he afterwards loses
possession of said property by accident, We order that he shall be entitled to
an action to recover the same. If anyone carefully examines the ancient laws,
he will ascertain that they authorize this.
(1) If, however, anyone should cease to hold possession of property, where the
owner or someone who has a lien on it has been barred by prescription of thirty
or forty years, We direct that the abovementioned relief shall be afforded him,
not indiscriminately, but in moderation; and if anyone should, in the
beginning, have held the said property in good faith, he can avail himself of
the same advantage.
But where he acquired it in bad faith, he shall, for this reason, be considered
unworthy, so that he who was the original owner of the property, or held it
under a pledge and was barred by the effect of the above-mentioned
prescription, can acquire the benefit of possession for himself, in the
capacity of a new possessor.
If, however, he had no right to such property at any time, then the original
owner, or the creditor who had possession of it under hypothecation, shall,
with their heirs, be permitted to recover it from the unlawful possessor,
notwithstanding that the former possessor has already excluded him by means of
the prescription of thirty or forty years, unless the illegal possessor himself
is protected by the prescription of thirty or forty years, to be computed from
the time when the former possessor, who evicted him, lost possession of said
property.
(2) We, however, decree that these rules shall only apply to possessors who
have obtained control of the property without violence, for if anyone should
forcibly remove it, the former possessor shall, by all means, be entitled to it
without any opposition.
(3) If, anyone, however, should obtain the property, not by violence, but by a
judicial decision, he shall only be responsible for the time when the former
possessor was absent, and was summoned to court, and he, like others entitled
to the ownership of the property, shall be permitted, within a year, to take
the said property if he presents himself, and offers security for the conduct
of the case, and to obey the decision with reference to the matter in
litigation.
(4) We decree that the prescription of thirty or forty years shall, in the case
of contracts in which interest is promised, begin to run from the time when the
debtor has failed to pay it.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Idesof December, during the
Consulate of our Lord the Emperor Justinian.
9. The Same to Demosthenes, Prsetorian Prefect.Certain persons frequently call
their opponents into court, and in the prosecution of judicial proceedings are
not able to bring their cases to a definite conclusion, and as the conditions
of life are subject to constant variation, they, in the meantime, having
preserved silence either on account of the superior power of their adversaries,
or their own weakness, or for innumerable other reasons which can neither be
mentioned nor enumerated, appear to have forfeited their rights, because, after
the last trial of the case, the term of thirty years has elapsed, and having
been opposed by a prescription of this kind see their property transferred to
others, which in former times caused them much sorrow and with good reason, as
they had no remedy.
We, desiring to correct this, do not permit such a prescription based upon the
lapse of thirty years to be pleaded in a case of this kind, but even though a
personal action was brought in the first place, We authorize it to be extended
to the fortieth year, as he who is in the beginning absolutely silent as to his
rights does not resemble him who filed his complaint, came into court, and went
to trial, but for some cause or other was prevented from finishing his case.
And, although the plaintiff himself may have died, We decree that he can leave
the conduct of his action to his posterity, and that his heirs or successors
shall be permitted to conduct it to a conclusion, and not be in any way barred
by the prescription of thirty years.
The period available (that is to say, the term of forty years), We decree shall
be computed from the time when the last judicial investigation took place,
after both parties failed to proceed.
TITLE XL.
CONCERNING THE ABOLITION OF THE PRESCRIPTION OF A
YEAR AFFECTING CONTRACTS MADE IN ITALY, AND THE
DIFFERENT TERMS, EXCEPTIONS, PRESCRIPTIONS, AND
INTERRUPTIONS OF THE SAME.
1. The Emperor Justinian to Julian, Prsetorian Prefect.
With reference to the exception of a year which is applicable to contracts made
in Italy, such an enormous mass of controversies has arisen in all the
tribunals that it is difficult to enumerate and impossible to explain them;
for, in the first place, it has been attended with so many technicalities and
difficulties that it is necessary for many things to agree in order for it to
take effect. Then some authorities have interpreted the said period in such a
liberal way that it can be extended as long as ten years; others have held that
it should be limited to five, and in Our time, different constructions have
been made by judges with reference to this computation; hence this exception
does not readily produce any effect upon litigation.
Therefore, as other exceptions of time or prescriptions appear to Us to be
sufficient, We are not willing for the subjects of Our Empire
to be embarrassed by difficulties of this kind, and therefore the
abovementioned exception of a year having been absolutely abolished, all other
lawful exceptions and prescriptions shall have full force in the courts,
whether they depend upon the lapse of ten, twenty, thirty, or forty years, or
whether they run for a shorter time.
(1) As nothing prevents matters which are in any way doubtful from being
explained by clearer or more comprehensive laws, We direct that all personal
actions which any voluminous interpretation has attempted to extend beyond the
limit of thirty years shall be terminated by the said period of thirty years,
unless the lawful method, which was mentioned by the ancient laws as well as
ours, introduced an interruption of the time, and that the hypothecary action
alone shall be extinguished after the expiration of forty years.
Hence, let no one venture to decide that a suit in partition, or for the
division of property owned in common, or for the establishment of boundaries,
or of partnership, or of theft, or of property seized with violence, or any
other personal action, can be brought after a longer time than thirty years.
But where a suit could properly be brought in the beginning, and, having once
been instituted, was not renewed by repeated false allegations (as was stated
in the action of theft) it may be terminated after the above-mentioned time has
expired.
All actions which have been brought in the courts, even though they are
personal ones, and have been argued, and afterwards abandoned, are hereby
excepted; for, in the case of these, Our former law provided that not thirty,
but forty years must elapse from the time when the litigants last became silent
with reference to their claims.
(2) In order that this law may not appear to be imperfect, since provision has
already been made for prescription to run against the sons of a family with
reference to their mother's estate, from the time when they were released from
paternal control, but nothing was especially provided with reference to other
property which cannot be acquired, We order, by this clearly stated law, that
no prescription can be pleaded against the sons of a family in all cases in
which property is not acquired for their parents, except from the time when
they could have brought suit, that is to say, after they had been released from
the control of their father, or of him in whose power they were; for who could
blame them for not doing this, even if they were willing, when they could not
act on account of the opposition of the law?
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof April, during the
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
2. The Same Emperor to John, Prsstorian Prefect.
In order that We may protect the interests of all persons in a more thorough
manner, and that neither absence, superior authority, nor the infamy of an
adversary may injure anyone, but that a distinction may be made between the
negligent and the vigilant, We decree that if he who has possession of property
belonging to another, or
which is pledged to a creditor, should be absent, and the owner of the said
property or the creditor, desires to exercise his right of action, he shall not
be permitted to do so in the absence of his adversary, who has possession of
the property, or who labors under the disadvantage of either infancy or
insanity, and has no guardian or curator to represent him, or is subject to
superior power, and that the owner or creditor aforesaid cannot seize the
property by his own authority; but permission is hereby given him to appear
before the Governor of the province, or to send him a statement in writing, and
file his complaint within the time prescribed by law, and, by so doing,
interrupt the prescription, and this shall be amply sufficient for the purpose.
If, however, he should be unable to appear before the Governor, he can apply to
the bishop of the diocese, or the Defender of the City, and state his wishes in
writing without delay. When the Governor, the bishop, or the Defender of the
City is absent, he shall be permitted to publish his intention in the place
where the possessor has his domicile, by means of a statement signed by a
notary, or if there are no notaries in the city, by one signed by three
witnesses, and this shall be sufficient for the interruption of any
prescription, whether it be of three years, or for a longer time, or even for
thirty or forty years.
All other prescriptions of long time, whether they are of thirty or forty
years, which have been established either by ancient legislators or by
Ourselves, shall remain in full force.
Given at Constantinople, during the Kalendsof October, after the Consulate of
Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
3. The Same to John, Praetorian Prefect.
Where one person is indebted to another on account of several different claims,
and, having brought suit, did not include in his petition the separate amount
of each, but only stated the entire indebtedness, a doubt arose among the
ancient authorities whether all of the debts had been brought into court, or
whether the proceedings only related to the oldest one, or whether the act of
the creditor was void, as his intention appeared to be uncertain.
We have found disputes of this kind in many cases which have been brought in
the courts, and, above all, with reference to the interruption of prescription.
If, for instance, a personal action had been brought, and no mention of an
hypothecary action was made, certain authorities held that the personal action
was affected by the interruption of prescription, but that the hypothecary
action was extinguished on account of its not having been referred to.
And if someone had alleged in general terms that another was indebted to him,
additional doubts arose whether all competent actions should be considered to
be included in a mere statement of this kind, or whether, as they were passed
over in silence, they were barred by prescription, as they acquired no support
from the uncertain wording of the petition.
Therefore, We order that no doubt of this kind shall be entertained hereafter
in cases in court, but anyone who has instituted proceedings against his
debtor, and has produced the document evidencing his agreement, whether it only
refers to his indebtedness in a general way, or specifically mentions a single
obligation, the plaintiff shall be considered to have brought all his claims
into court, and his petition shall be held to include all personal as well as
hypothecary causes of action; and the course of prescription will be
interrupted, as prescriptions pleaded against persons who are negligent and
careless of their own rights are odious.
TITLE XLI.
CONCERNING ALLUVION, MARSHES, AND PASTURES BROUGHT INTO ANOTHER CONDITION.
1. The Emperor Gordian to Marcus.
Although it is not lawful to divert the natural course of a stream to another
place by artificial means, still it is not forbidden to protect a bank against
a rapid current. But where a river, having left its former channel, makes
another for itself, the land which it surrounds remains the property of the
former owner. If, however, it does this by degrees, and carries soil elsewhere,
this is acquired under the right of alluvion by the person to whose land it is
added.
2. The Emperors Arcadius, Honorius, and Theodosius to Csesarius, Prastorian
Prefect.
Persons whom the inundations of the River Nile enrich are required to pay taxes
in proportion to the lands which they hold. Those, however, who deplore the
loss of their estates from this cause are, on the other hand, released from the
burden of taxation. The new proprietors protected by Our generosity should
remain content with the possession of what they hold, and gratefully pay the
taxes assessed upon them.
3. The Emperors Valentinian and Theodosius to Cyrus, Prsstorian Prefect.
Land acquired by the possessors by virtue of the right of alluvion either in
Egypt on account of the inundations of the Nile, or in other provinces through
the overflow of different rivers, can neither be sold by the Treasury, claimed
by anyone, assessed separately, nor be the subject of additional taxation, and
this We decree by this law, which shall remain forever valid, lest We may
appear to ignore the defects of alluvial titles, or render the property
injurious to the possessors of the same.
In like manner, We do not permit lands which, in former times, were either
marshes or devoted to pasture, and are now rendered fertile at the expense of
the possessors of the same, to be sold, claimed, or assessed separately as
capable of cultivation and subject to in-
creased taxation, lest those who are diligent may not regret that their labors
have been dedicated to the culture of the soil, and may realize that their
industry did not result in their injury.
We decree that violators of this law shall be punished by a fine of fifty
pounds of gold, and Your Highness will also be included, if you should make any
other construction of this law, in order to countenance the claims of those who
may demand it.
TITLE XLII.
CONCERNING THE DECISIONS OF PRAETORIAN PREFECTS.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Thalassius, Prse-torian Prefect of
Illyria.
We grant the right of petition to litigants against whom a decision has been
rendered by the Praetorian Prefecture, if they allege that they have been
injured contrary to law, but We do not concede them the right of appeal, even
though the decision was said to have been rendered with reference to a curia,or
for some other object of general utility, or for any other reason, as it is not
conducive to the public welfare to deny to individuals the assistance of a law;
and hence the right of petition against decisions of the Prastorian Prefecture
is given them only within the term of two years after the judge who decided the
case has retired from office.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Idesof August, during the
Consulate of Theodosius, Consul for the thirteenth time, and Festus, Consul for
the fifth time, 439.
TITLE XLIII.
How AND WHEN A JUDGE SHOULD RENDER A DECISION
IN THE PRESENCE OF BOTH PARTIES, OR IN THE ABSENCE
OF ONE OF THEM.
1. The Emperor Marcus JElius Antoninus to Publicius.
You will not always be obliged to decide against an absent party under the
Rescript of My Father, by which it was provided that decisions could even be
rendered against those who are absent, for by this it is meant that you can
decide against one who is not present, but not that it is absolutely necessary
for you to do so.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Severus.
It is certain that although judgment has not been rendered under the terms of
the Peremptory Edict, a decision can be given by the judge against those who,
having been notified, have refused to appear in court.
Given on the fourth of the Kalendsof April, under the Consulate of Gordian and
Pontianus, 139.
3. The Same Emperor to Antistius.
You cannot avoid complying with the judgment on the ground that it was rendered
during your absence, and without your knowledge, and as you allege, no defence
was made, if, when you first learned of it, you did not immediately file a
complaint; for the decision which has been rendered will not be valid if you
did not consent to it.
Published on the fourth of the Idesof June, during the Consulate of Gordian and
Aviola, 240.
4. The Emperor Philip to Domitian.
If, as you state, the adverse party obtained a judgment against you on the
ground of contumacy, on a holiday when you were absent, or while you were
ignorant that it had been rendered by the judge, the Governor will, not without
reason, assign the case to another judge to be settled by his decision.
Published on the fifth of the Idesof October, during the Consulate of
Peregrinus and -SSlianus, 245.
5. The Same Emperor and the Csesar Philip to Longinm.
If (as you allege) the Governor of the province, after having appointed a
certain place for hearing the case, fraudulently decided it against you
elsewhere during your absence, whatever was done shall have no effect whatever
in law.
6. The Emperors Valerian and Galliemis to Domitius.
If the Governor refused to admit the appeal made by the guardian of your wards
at the time when they, having become adults, had no curator, he will be
required to hear the case again; for any decision rendered at that time should
not prejudice the rights of said minors, they having been deprived of a just
defence and the assistance of a curator.
7. The Emperor Diocletian and Maximian to Marinus.
It is certain that judgments rendered against absent parties not guilty of
contumacy, and who have not been notified in the usual way, cannot be
considered as res judicata.
Published on the third of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of
Diocletian, Consul for the fifth time, and Maximian, Consul for the fourth
time, 293.
8. The Same Emperors to Claudia.
It is in conformity with law that the Governor of the province, after having
observed all the legal formalities and notified the adverse party three times
by means of letters, or once for all by a peremptory edict to appear as is
required, if the latter perseveres in his obstinacy, to hear the allegations of
the party who is present, or take care that his successor shall do so.
Wherefore, if the other party has been summoned three times and still
obstinately refuses to appear, it
will not be unreasonable for the judge to either compel him to do so, or
transfer the possession of the property in dispute to you, and make your
adversary the plaintiff, or, having heard your defence, render his decision as
the law may require.
Published on the third of the Kalendsof October, ....
Extract from Novel 112, Chapter III. Latin Text.
He who has once brought suit, whether by instituting proceedings in court or by
the presentation of a petition to the Emperor, can notify the judge, and the
latter having served notice on his adversary, the plaintiff will be required to
prosecute the suit to the end.
If, however, he should defer doing so on the demand of the defendant, he shall
be summoned by three edicts at intervals of thirty days, for the reason that
the voice of the public crier reaches but few persons. This citation may be
issued by persons appointed by the Emperor, and applies even if the case has
not yet begun.
If, after having been summoned, the plaintiff refuses to proceed, he shall be
allowed the term of a year, and if he fails to act during that time, the judge,
having heard the allegations of the party who is present, and ascertained the
truth, shall render his decision. But where the plaintiff appears within a
year, he shall not be allowed to proceed, unless he first pays the defendant
the expenses which he has incurred. If, when these are paid, he again fails to
prosecute the case for a year, after having been summoned three times, and the
aforesaid term has expired, he shall lose all his rights of action.
9. The Same Emperors to Leontius.
It has very properly been provided that three summonses have all the force of a
peremptory edict against persons guilty of contumacy.
Published on the eleventh of the Kalendsof November, during the ^Consulate of
Diocletian, Consul for the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third
time.
10. The Same Emperors to Blesius.
As you went on a journey, not of your own free will, but through necessity, the
law will not permit any judgment to be rendered against you so as to injure you
in any way, when your absence was the result of necessity.
Published on the third of the Idesof May, during the Consulate of Tiberanus and
Dio, 291.
11. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Valerius.
As you state that the suit was begun when all the parties were present, and
that afterwards judgment was rendered against you, although you were absent,
and you did not appeal within the time prescribed by law, many Imperial
Constitutions oppose your demand to have the judgment rendered against you set
aside.
TITLE XLIV.
CONCERNING OPINIONS RENDERED WITH REFERENCE TO STATEMENTS MADE IN A WRITTEN
PETITION.
1. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus to Quintus.
The decision of an arbiter is void if he himself did not deliver it to the
parties litigant, even though he may have notified them in writing. Therefore,
if what you allege is true, your case can be heard again by the Governor of the
province, without taking into account the fact that you did not appeal.
2. The Emperors Valens, Valentinian, and Gratian to Probus, Prse-torian
Prefect.
We think that it should be perpetually established by this law that judges who
are required to hear and determine cases should not arrive at sudden
conclusions, but should render their decisions after careful consideration and
reflection; and, after having revised them, and reduced them to writing with
the greatest accuracy, they ought to deliver them in this form to the parties
interested, and not afterwards be permitted to correct or change them, with the
exception of the Illustrious Praetorian Prefect and others who administer
important offices, and eminent judges to whom permission is granted to read
their final decisions, or have this done by their attendants and the other
officers in their service.
Given on the eleventh of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of
Gratian, Consul for the second time, and Probus, 371.
3. The Same Emperors to Probus, Praetorian Prefect.
We order by Our general laws that all judges whom We have invested with the
power of dispensing justice in the various provinces, after having heard the
cases, shall render their final decision in writing. We add to this law that
any judgment rendered without having been reduced to writing shall not be
worthy of the name, and the formality of an appeal shall not be required for
the annulment of such a wrongful decree.
Given on the third of the Nonesof December, under the Consulate of Gratian,
Consul for the fourth time, and Equitius, 374.
Extract from Novel 117, Chapter III. Latin Text.
When the suits are of little importance, and the property involved of trifling
value, or the parties of inferior rank, the Governor must hear them and render
judgment orally, and without any costs, nor shall the bishop be required to
reduce his decision to writing in cases where persons subject to his authority
are concerned.
TITLE XLV.
CONCERNING THE FINAL AND INTERLOCUTORY DECISIONS OF ALL JUDGES.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Quintilian.
The decision of your predecessor does not appear to Us to be legal, as he, in
rendering it between the plaintiff and the defendant's attorney, did not decide
against the latter but the client represented by him, who did not appear
personally in court. You can, therefore, hear the cause again, just as if it
had never been tried.
Given on the fourth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Antoninus,
Consul for the third time, and Geta, 209.
2. The Emperor Antoninus to Sextilius.
If the arbiter appointed by the magistrate was in possession of his freedom
when he rendered his award, even though he was subsequently reduced to slavery,
the award rendered by him will, nevertheless, have the authority of res
judicata.
3. The Emperor Alexander to Vecti^ls.
The Governor of the province is aware of the fact that a final decision, which
does not include either condemnation or acquittal, is not considered legal.
Published during the Kalendsof October.
4. The Same Emperor to Severus.
It is certain that a decision rendered by a Governor contrary to the usual
formalities required in judgments does not obtain the authority of res
judicata.
Published on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Alexander and Dio, 230.
5. The Emperor Philip and the Csesar Philip to Montanus.
If the Attorney of the Treasury ordered the property of those indebted to it to
be delivered to their sureties, under the condition that they should indemnify
the Treasury, no appeal will lie from his decision, and it consequently must be
obeyed as rendered.
6. The Emperors Cams, Carinus, and Numerianus to Zoilus.
As you allege that the decision of the Governor is void for the reason that he
did not render it in public, but in a secret place, and without the presence of
his attendant, no injury can result to you from anything that he decided.
Published on the fifth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of Carus
and Carinus, 283.
7. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Isidora.
The Governor of the province, by persuading you to compromise with your
relatives in the action on stipulation which you brought
against them, does not extinguish the verbal obligation, which can only be
annulled in a way provided by law, for the mere act of a judge has not the
force of a judicial decision, as his authority is confined within certain
limits, as has been frequently established. Wherefore, if, having heard the
case, the Governor did not decide in accordance with the rules of law, his
words persuading you to permanently dispose of the action (if you had one)
could not produce this effect.
8. The Same Emperors and Csssars to Licinius.
If Theodora, whom you allege was liberated either on account of a purchase or
because of her delivery to a creditor in discharge of a debt, has been decided
to be free, the judgment cannot be set aside without having recourse to an
appeal. But if suit was brought, and a decision rendered after he who is said
to be the owner of the woman was notified, you will not be prevented from
recovering the amount of your interest in the purchase, if you bought her, or
to recover the debt, if she was given in payment for one.
9. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Domnus.
After final judgment in a case, anything decided by the magistrate who rendered
it, or his successor, with reference to the question already disposed of, does
not obtain the force of res judicata,nor do decisions involving possession in
any way prejudice the ownership of the property, and interlocutory decrees do
not, for the most part, terminate an action.
Ordered on the Nonesof April, during the Consulate of the Caesars.
10. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Menodorus.
Anyone invested with judicial authority is not allowed to forbid a person to
remain in his own country. Given on the third of the Nones....
11. The Same Emperors and Csssars to Lucian.
When the judge, by a final decision, merely orders that an oath shall be
tendered, without adding what shall be done if the oath is taken, or refused,
it is clear that his decision will be of no force or effect.
12. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Julian, Proconsul of Asia,.
Judges can render their decisions in the Latin as well as in the Greek
language.
13. The Emperor Justinian to Demosthenes, Praetorian Prefect.
Let no judge or arbiter think that he is compelled to abide by any of the
results of Imperial consultations which he does not consider to have been
stated properly and in accordance with law, and this
applies with still greater force to the decisions of the Illustrious Prefects
and other dignitaries, for if any matters have not been properly disposed of,
this defect should not be extended to the decrees of other judges, as the
decisions of courts should not be founded upon the examples set by others, but
upon the laws. The final decisions of the Prefecture, or the court of any other
supreme magistrate, are not binding if not legal, and We order all Our judges
to conform to the truth, and to follow the principles of law and justice. Given
on the third of the Kalendsof November ....
14. The Same Emperor to Demosthenes, Prastorian Prefect.
As that distinguished man, Papinian, very properly stated in his book of
Questions, that a judge could not only discharge the defendant from liability,
but could render a decision against the plaintiff himself, if, on the other
hand, he should find that he was indebted to the defendant, We also order this
rule to be extended so that the judge may be permitted to render a decision
against the plaintiff, and require him to either pay or do something without
allowing any exception to be pleaded against him on the ground that he is not a
competent judge of the plaintiff, for he should not object to have the same
judge whom he had accepted in the beginning of the case decide against him at
the end.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof December, during the fifth Consulate of
Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
Extract from Novel 96, Chapter II. Latin Text.
In consequence of this, if I have been sued by anyone, and desire to sue him in
return, I will not be permitted to do so except before the same judge; and, if
he is displeasing to my adversary, he can reject him within twenty days, and
have another appointed before whom the case can be tried a second time. Then
the case against me having been first disposed of, I shall be permitted to have
my own heard.
15. A Law which is not Authentic.
16. The Same Emperor to Julian, Prsetorian Prefect.
As it is customary for magistrates to render interlocutory decrees setting
forth that the parties shall not be permitted to have recourse to an appeal, or
to call their jurisdiction in question before a final decision has been given,
certain authorities held that before issue has been joined, a judge cannot be
objected to, nor can an appeal be taken from his interlocutory decree. For as
the same terms are applicable to an appeal as to an objection to jurisdiction,
and an appeal cannot be taken before issue has been joined, they thought that
no one would be permitted to refuse a judge before issue had been joined, which
is by no means prohibited. Hence judges must be careful to use terms of this
kind together, and without making any distinction between them.
TITLE XLVI.
CONCERNING DECISIONS WHICH ARE RENDERED WITHOUT STATING THE EXACT AMOUNT TO BE
PAID.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to &liana.
It is clear that the judge did not render his decision against the rule of law
in providing, as you allege, that interest must be paid until the amount
mentioned in the judgment has been settled.
2. The Emperor Alexander to Marcellinus.
Although the sum of money due is not stated in the decision of the Curator of
the State, his decision, nevertheless, is valid, since he ordered the State to
be indemnified.
3. The Emperor Gordian to JEmylius.
The following decision, namely, "Pay the entire amount due with legal
interest," does not comply with the requirements of the action to enforce
judgment, as a judicial decision which does not specify a certain sum only
obtains the authority of res judicatawhen the amount has been mentioned in some
other part of the documents belonging to the case.
4. The Same Emperor to Saturnina.
The following decision, namely, "Pay what you have received in good faith," as
it is uncertain how much the debtor received, and how much is demanded of
himand especially when the judge who promulgated the decision out of the
regular order has rendered an interlocutory decree that the dowry which had
been given and which was claimed had not been paiddoes not obtain the
authority of judgment.
Therefore, if another judge should afterwards render a judgment and decide
against you, and you do not appeal from his decision, you will confirm it by
your own act.
TITLE XLVII. CONCERNING DECISIONS RENDERED FOR DAMAGES.
1. The Emperor Justinian to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
As an infinite number of doubts with reference to damages arose among the
ancients, it seems best to Us, as far as is possible, to reduce this prolixity
into more narrow limits. Hence We order that, whenever the amount or the nature
of the property is certain, as in the case of sales, leases, and all other
contracts, the damages shall not exceed double the value of the property. In
other instances, however, where the value seems to be uncertain, the judges
having jurisdiction shall carefully ascertain the actual amount of the loss,
and damages to that amount shall be granted, and it shall not be reduced by any
machinations and immoderate perversions of values leading to in-
extricable confusion, lest, when the calculation is indefinitely reduced, it
may become impossible of application; as We know that it is in conformity with
Nature that those penalties alone should be exacted which can be imposed with a
proper degree of moderation, or are definitely prescribed by the laws'.
Our Constitution not only applies where loss, but also to where profit is
involved, for the reason that the ancient authorities held that damages could
be collected from him who did not obtain any profit, when he could have done
so.
Let the promulgation of this Constitution put an end to verbosity in all cases,
in accordance with what has been already stated.
Given at Constantinople on the Kalendsof September, after the fifth Consulate
of Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
TITLE XLVIII.
WHERE A DECISION HAS BEEN RENDERED BY A JUDGE WHO is SAID NOT TO BE COMPETENT.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Sabinianus.
When a judge has been appointed to decide a certain matter, and renders an
opinion with reference to others which have no connection with it, he performs
an act which is void in law.
Given on the third of the Nonesof . . . , during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and ^lianus, 224.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Licinia.
If a military judge, who was not appointed by one who had authority to do so,
should hear a case which ought to have been determined by means of a civil
proceeding, his act will not have the authority of a legal decision, and an
appeal need not be taken.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Phileta.
If a judge appointed to determine the right of ownership did not render
judgment against you on this point, the Governor of the province, after having
been applied to, shall take cognizance of your case, and decide it, and the
right of ownership will, by no means, be prejudiced because it is established
that a decision has been rendered with reference to possession.
Ordered at Herculaneum, on the Nonesof November, during the Consulate of the
Caesars, 297.
4. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Potitus, Vicegerent.
This rule also applies to the cases of private persons, namely, that a decision
rendered by a judge without authority does not bind any of the litigants.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof October ....
TITLE XLIX.
CONCERNING THE PENALTY TO WHICH A JUDGE is LIABLE WHO HAS RENDERED AN IMPROPER
DECISION, AND THE PUNISHMENT WHICH MAY BE INFLICTED UPON ANYONE WHO ATTEMPTS TO
CORRUPT A JUDGE, OR His ADVERSARY. 1. The Emperor Antoninus to Gaudius.
It is established that, where in any case, either public or private, or in
which the Treasury is interested, money is paid by anyone, whether to the judge
or to the adversary of the former, he who, doubtful of the justice of his
cause, placed a corrupt hope of success in the payment of money, will lose his
action.
Given on the seventh of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the two
Aspers, 213.
Extract from Novel 124, Chapter II. Latin Text.
By the new law, which provides that where any person acknowledges that he has
given or promised something to another, and can prove it, he shall be pardoned,
but he who received the bribe or accepted the promise, if the case involves the
payment of money, shall be required, by the Count of Private Affairs, to pay
three times the amount of what was given, and double the amount of what was
promised, and shall be deprived of his office, and when the case is a criminal
one, all his property shall be confiscated, and he shall be sent into exile.
If, however, the litigant should be unable to prove that anything was either
given or promised, and he who is said to have accepted it swears that he did
not receive anything from him or from anyone else, or that no promise was made,
he shall be discharged. The litigant who was unable to prove his allegations
shall be compelled by the Count of Private Affairs,1 to deposit in his hands a
sum equal to the amount involved in the suit, which shall be prosecuted to a
conclusion, and in a criminal case, all his property having been confiscated, a
decision shall be rendered by a competent judge in conformity with law. If the
person indicated by the litigant should refuse to take the oath aforesaid, he
shall be subjected to the abovementioned penalty.
When, however, one of the parties litigant swears that he did not either give
or promise anything, and if it should be proved within the term of ten months
after the decision has been rendered that he did give or promise something,
both those who gave and those who received the money or other property shall
suffer the penalties aforesaid.
2. The Emperor Constantine to Felix.
He who has been corrupted by money, or who, through partiality, has rendered a
wrongful decision, shall be required to indemnify the
1 The Comes Rerum Privatarum,who took the place, and discharged the duties of
the former Imperial Procurator or Steward, was the official to whom was
committed the care and management of the private demesnes of the Emperor.ED.
party whom he injured, not only for the costs of the suit, but also to assume
the risk of the same.
Given at Constantinople, on the eighth of the Kalendsof November, during the
Consulate of Constantine, Consul for the fifth time, and Licinius, 319.
TITLE L.
A DECISION WHEN ONCE RENDERED CANNOT BE REVOKED.
1. The Emperor Gordian to Secundus.
There is no doubt that anyone cannot revoke either his own decision or that of
his predecessor, and it is a well-known rule of law that it is not necessary to
take an appeal from a decision of this kind.
Published during the Kalendsof March, ....
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Alexander.
The Perpetual Edict clearly states that peremptory exceptions which have been
omitted in the beginning can be pleaded subsequently before judgment is
rendered. If this has not previously been done, complete restitution will be
permitted; for where judgment has been rendered against persons over the age of
twenty-five years, on the ground that prescription was not contested, it cannot
be annulled without having recourse to the remedy of appeal.
Given at Nicomedia, on the seventh of the Kalendsof January, during the
Consulate of the Caesars.
3. The Emperor Constantine to Proculus.
It has been decided that rescripts which have been granted shall not have
authority when the cases to which they relate have once been terminated by a
judicial decision which admitted of no appeal, but those who have obtained
rescripts of this kind should also be excluded from making use of them in
court.
Given at Constantinople, on the sixth of the Kalendsof January, during the
Consulate of the Emperor ....
TITLE LI.
CONCERNING THE PROFITS AND THE EXPENSES OF LITIGATION.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Cassars, to Alexander.
The term "profits" only includes what remains after the deduction of the
legitimate expenses.
Given on the third of the Nonesof April, during the Consulate of
the Caesars.
2. The Emperor Valentinian to Olybrius, Praetorian Prefect.
The defeated party litigant is not only required to restore the property, but
also to pay over the profits which he himself has obtained, as well as those
which he could have acquired, and he must pay them from the time that he knew
that he was a possessor in bad faith, as established by the action brought in
court.
This rule shall also apply to an heir whose property is held by the same
defective title.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof March, ....
3. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Asclepiodotus, Prse-torian Prefect.
After a matter has been terminated and settled by compromise, no action, even
if based upon a rescript, will be granted for the purpose of recovering the
expenses, unless, all the parties being present, the judge who rendered an
opinion in the first matter stated in his decision that the expenses of the
case should be paid to the successful party, or that he had a right to resort
to legal proceedings to collect them, for where anyone has been released from
future liability when the case was decided, it would be infamous to authorize
another action to be brought with reference to what had been settled by the
first one.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Kalendsof April, during the
Consulate of Asclepiodotus and Marinianus, 423.
4. The Emperors Valentinian. Theodosius, and Arcadius, Edict to the People.
He by whose demand someone has been summoned in accordance with the legal
formalities to a place far from his residence, and the hearing of his case
protracted, is hereby notified that, if by his fault the trial was deferred, or
if he should not himself be present, or should be unable to prove his
allegations, he must pay the penalty prescribed by the laws for malicious
litigations; and if the expenses were incurred in a pecuniary case, the value
of the property claimed, as well as the time consumed in the journey, having
been considered, the judge shall render a decision in accordance with his
estimate of the damages sustained.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifth of the Idesof October, during the
Consulate of Valentinian, Consul for the seventh time, and Avie-nus, 450.
5. A Law which is not Aiithentic.
6. The Emperor Anastasius to Stephen, General of the Army.
As certain persons allege that they enjoy privileges, some of them under the
laws and Imperial constitutions, and others through special favors which have
been granted them, as well as with reference to the payment of taxes by
agreement for which they are only liable to a specified amount, and are not
required to pay the costs of litigation at all, or only a small part of the
same, We decree by this law that whoever enjoys a privilege of this kind, or
may hereafter obtain it in
any way, is hereby notified that those against whom he has instituted any civil
or criminal proceeding will also enjoy the same right; as it would be
intolerable for those who are entitled to the privileges aforesaid to be
permitted to collect, as plaintiffs, anything more from their adversaries than
they themselves, as defendants, if beaten, would be compelled to surrender to
them, in turn; so, in order that this rule may be observed in every instance
involving privileges granted through liberality, or generally attaching to
certain offices, classes, or dignities, or which have been specially bestowed
upon certain persons, or which may hereafter be conferred, whether this has
been expressly stated in the Imperial grants or Rescripts or whether it has
been omitted, We order it to be enforced.
TITLE LII. CONCERNING RES JUDICATA.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Stellator.
A judicial decision must be adhered to, but if you can prove that the party in
whose favor judgment was rendered against you has received what he appeared to
have lost by theft, you can defend yourself by an exception on the ground of
fraud, if he attempts to carry the judgment into execution.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Antoninus,
Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus.
2. The Same Emperor to Pacatianus.
If a case which has been decided could be revived under the pretext of a
mistake in calculation, litigation would never end.
Published at Rome, on the day before the Nonesof . . . , during the Consulate
of Lsetus and Cerealis, 216.
3. The Same Emperor to Demetrius and Others.
If it should appear that you have collected money by means of fraudulent
accounts, and you have been ordered to refund it with a penalty, and you did
not appeal from the decision of the Governor, you will be obliged to pay the
entire amount of the judgment.
4. The Emperor Gordian to Antoninus.
It is a bad precedent to revive a case which has been decided, under the
pretext of the discovery of new documents. Given on the eighth of the Idesof
March.
5. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Valentine.
It is clearly proved that the party demanding a delay for payment acquiesced in
the decision, and he is in the same position as one who in any other way has
agreed to it; for a case which has been terminated should not be suffered to be
revived.
6. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Julian, Proconsul of Africa.
We desire that matters which have been transacted by public authority shall
remain forever valid, as the public faith should not pass away with the death
of the official having jurisdiction.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of
Constans, 414.
TITLE LIII. CONCERNING THE EXECUTION OF JUDGMENT.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Justin.
The court was too hasty in ordering the pledges of Marcella to be taken in
execution and sold, for in order that the procedure prescribed by law may be
observed, you must first bring suit against your adversary, and the case having
been heard, have judgment rendered in your favor.
Published on the third of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of
Albinus and jEmilianus, 207.
2. The Same Emperors to Agrippa.
If you have not changed the judgment by novation, the Governor of the province,
after the pledges have been taken in execution and sold, shall order the
proceeds to be disposed of for your benefit. If, however, the case has been
altered by novation, an action on stipulation will lie in your favor, and a
competent judge having been appointed, you can proceed in accordance with the
legal formalities.
3. The Same Emperors to Agrippa.
The nature of the transaction and the delay in payment which has resulted
demand a more speedy remedy; therefore, if you appear before the Governor of
the province, whose duty it is to see that the judgment is executed, and state
that although the land given in pledge has, in accordance with the contract,
for a long time been offered at public sale, it has not yet found a purchaser
on account of the intrigues of the adverse party, he will place you in
possession of the said land, in order that by this means the execution which
has been so long delayed may be issued.
Given on the eleventh of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Messala
and Sabinus, 215.
4. The Same Emperors to the Soldier Marcellus.
The Governor of the province will not permit your pay to be withheld for the
purpose of satisfying the judgment which has been rendered against you, since
this can be accomplished by having recourse to other measures.
Published on the third of the Nones....
5. The Emperor Gordian to Amandus.
It is well known that the claims of a debtor can be taken in execution where
judgment has been rendered against him.
Published on the third of the Idesof October, during the Consulate of Atticus
and Prsetextus, 243.
6. The Emperor Philip and the Caesar to Titian.
If (as you allege) the court officer appointed to execute the judgment assumed
judicial duties, and thought that a decision should be rendered contrary to
what had previously been determined with reference to your case, the opinion
given by him can never obtain the torce of a judgment.
7. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Theodorus.
If the restoration to which you were entitled has been delayed by the
protracted and unconcealed efforts of the adverse party, and the slaves who
were the subject of controversy have died, their value should be paid to you by
him who prevented you from receiving them. The animals, also, together with
their offspring, shall be delivered to you by the intervention of the Governor.
8. The Same Emperors and Caesars to Nicomachus.
It is clear that the official whose duty it is to see that the judgment is
executed after it has been rendered, and the case has been heard and argued by
the parties, is the only person who can give force and effect to the decision.
Without date or designation of Consulate.
9. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Glyco.
Bring suit before the Governor of the province against those whom you allege to
be your debtors, whether they acknowledge the obligation or deny it, and having
had judgment rendered against them, if they do not satisfy it by payment within
the time prescribed by law, the Governor, observing the legal formalities
shall, after the pledges have been seized and sold, see that execution takes
place in the manner repeatedly mentioned in the Imperial constitutions.
Ordered on the Nonesof November, during the Consulate of the Csesars.
TITLE LIV.
CONCERNING INTEREST ON A JUDGMENT. 1. The Emperor Antoninus to the Managers of
Estates.He who proceeds against the property of a defeated party litigant in
accordance with the judgment rendered shall, in addition to the principal, be
entitled to interest at twelve per cent for the time which elapsed during which
he refused to obey the judgment.
2. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Prsetorian Prefect.
Those who have been ordered to pay a certain sum of money, and have failed to
do so for more than four months from the date of the judgment, or, if an appeal
was taken, have failed to satisfy it from the day of its confirmation, We
decree shall be required to pay interest at twelve per cent; and what has been
prescribed by former laws which imposed upon them interest at twenty-four per
cent, or by Our law which fixed the rate at six per cent, shall not apply to
the cases of such persons.
Given at Constantinople, on the seventh of the Idesof April, during the
Consulate of Decius, 529.
3. The Same Emperor to John, Praetorian Prefect.We decree that if anyone should
have judgment rendered against him, and a further delay of four months has been
granted by Us, he shall, after that time has expired, be compelled to pay
interest at the rate of twelve per cent in accordance with the terms of the
judgment; but this shall only be on the principal and not on the interest which
was originally included in the judgment, for We have already decided that the
collection of interest on interest shall be abolished, and have left no case in
which this can be done. For if this was left without correction, something
absurd and awkward must necessarily result, as interest arising from contracts
is legally payable, and is very frequently fixed by Our laws at a lower rate
than twelve per cent; and compound interest would necessarily be imposed at a
higher rate than simple interest. If interest ran at twelve per cent at all
times on a judgment, this would rarely happen under the provisions of
contracts, and if, by certain articles of Our law exceptions have, in some
instances, been made, the necessities of the case were responsible for the
apparent injustice.
Hence, We, desiring to correct this by means of a proper remedy, do hereby
order that interest only on the principal to the amount of twelve per cent
shall be collected on a judgment, and that interest on interest, no matter at
what rate, shall not be exacted; since if the original contract was changed by
the judgment, interest should not be collected on the contract after the
judgment was rendered, for otherwise, it would only be payable on the principal
as a result of the judgment ; and because both principal and interest were
included in a single sum, it should not be concluded that interest on the
entire amount could be collected, but only on the principal.
(1) As the ancients, by an exceedingly pernicious regulation under which, in
the satisfaction of a judgment, indulgence was granted for two months to
persons who had lost their cases, their sureties, however, were not permitted
to enjoy this privilege, as the successful parties (the principals who had
judgment rendered against them being left for the time on account of the
provisions of the law) were authorized to collect the money or take the
property which was the object of the judgment from the sureties or mandators of
the former, We, desiring to abolish this injustice, do hereby order that the
delay
of four months which We granted to the principals in the case shall also be
extended to their sureties and mandators, in order that the law may not be
evaded, for when anyone who volunteers to defend a case is compelled to make
payment, and he, in his turn, forces the defendant involuntarily to satisfy
him, the defeated party does not experience the benefit of Our indulgence,
because, through his surety, he was compelled to pay the money which he owes.
TITLE LV.
WHERE JUDGMENT is RENDERED AGAINST SEVERAL PERSONS AT ONCE.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Victor.
If you and your colleagues have not had judgment in full rendered against you
severally, but only jointly for a single and specified sum, and it is not
stated in the judgment that what cannot be collected from one shall be made up
by the other, the effect of the decision is that each party shall be liable for
an equal portion. Therefore, if, in obedience to the judgment, you have paid
your share, you cannot be compelled to pay that of the other party if he should
fail to do so.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Annianus.
Whenever judgment is rendered against two guardians, each of whom had employed
an attorney to defend him, liability for the amount of the judgment is
considered to have been divided between them, hence it is a well-established
rule of law that what cannot be collected from one cannot be recovered from the
other.
TITLE LVI. WHO ARE NOT INJURED BY A JUDGMENT.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Masculinus.
If you did not commit the defence of your property to your brother, and did not
ratify his acts, the exception of res judicatawill not affect you, and
therefore you will not be prevented from conducting your case without prejudice
on account of the judgment.
Published during the Nonesof May, under the Consulate of Alexander, 223.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Athenius.
Where judgment has been rendered between certain parties, those who did not
appear in the case will experience neither benefit nor injury, and therefore
your granddaughter cannot be prejudiced where a judgment has been rendered
against her co-heirs, if nothing was decided against her.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Honoratus.
It is a perfectly clear rule of law that, even in criminal cases, those who did
not appear in court will not be affected, if, perchance, they should seem to
have sustained any injury.
4. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Soterianus.
It has frequently been held that where a case has been decided between certain
parties, the rights of one who is absent, and equally interested, will not be
prejudiced.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
TITLE LVII.
NOTICES, LETTERS, PROCLAMATIONS, AND SIGNATURES DO NOT POSSESS THE AUTHORITY OF
JUDGMENTS.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Rogatianus.
Notification by a judge who directs certain interest to be paid by persons who
failed to discharge a debt within a specified time does not have the force of a
stipulation.
Given on the day before the Idesof January, during the Consulate of Antoninus,
Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
2. The Emperor Alexander to Maximus.
The fact that the Governor of the province, by a letter, ordered you to pay a
certain sum of money to the State, does not have the effect of a judicial
decision.
Given on the fourth of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and Julianus, 234.
3. The Same Emperor to Zoticus.
It has frequently been stated in Rescripts that a decision rendered after the
trial of a case cannot be revoked by the signature of the Emperor.
Published on the sixth of the Idesof September, during the Consulate of Albinus
and Maximus, 228.
4. The Emperor Gordian to Asclepiodotus.
The interlocutory decree of a Governor, which has been duly recorded, ordering
the party sued to obey it by making payment of a debt or be liable to double or
quadruple damages, is rather the act of one who gives warning than the decision
of a magistrate, as the rule of law declares that an act of this kind does not
obtain the force of a judgment.
5. The Same Emperor to Jucundus.
The judge who admitted the controversy should have heard and examined the
allegations of both parties, for there is no doubt that the
note which he appended to the petition, and by which he placed one of the
parties in possession of the land, cannot be considered to take the place of a
judgment.
6. The Emperor Philip and the Csesar Philip to Cassianus.
It is clear that a proclamation published by the Governor of a province cannot
have the force of a judgment any more than a summons.
7. The Emperor Constantine to Bassus, Prsetorian Prefect.
It is not proper or customary for a judgment rendered after a prolonged contest
to be stated in a few written phrases.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of
Constantine, Consul for the sixth time, and Maximus, 306.
TITLE LVIII.
WHERE A JUDGMENT is BASED ON FORGED DOCUMENTS OR FALSE EVIDENCE.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Bassianus.
If you desire to declare a will to be forged, in accordance with the terms of
which the illustrious Proconsul has rendered a judgment, he will grant you a
hearing, notwithstanding this is barred by the judgment, because the question
as to the forgery of the will has not yet been decided.
2. The Emperor Alexander to Optatus.
Those who did not appeal when they were able to prove that they had lost their
case by reason of forged documents should be heard just as if the suit was
begun for the first time, as they are giving information with reference to a
crime.
Published on the sixth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of
Julian, Consul for the second time, and Crispinus.
3. The Same Emperor to Clement.
You will not be prevented from proving in the ordinary way that the evidence
which the adverse party produced against you in court is (as you allege) false.
The judgment, however, shall not be set aside unless you can show that he who
rendered it decided against you, because he relied upon the genuineness of an
instrument which is proved to have been forged.
Published on the seventh of the Kalendsof September, ....
4. The Emperor Gordian to Herennius.
The execution of a judgment is usually suspended, and recovery of what has been
paid granted, if it can be shown by positive evidence that the judge was
deceived by aforged instrument, the commission of the crime having afterwards
been established.
Published on the fifth of the Idesof September, ....
TITLE LIX. CONCERNING CONFESSIONS.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Julianus.
It has been decided that confessions made in court have the effect of
judgments, therefore you have no right to revoke your confession, as you will
be compelled to make payment.
Adopted on the third of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of Gentian
and Bassus, 212.
TITLE LX.
ACTS PERFORMED OR JUDGMENTS RENDERED BETWEEN SOME PERSONS CANNOT PREJUDICE THE
RIGHTS OF
OTHERS.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Epicratus.
It has frequently been decided that matters transacted by certain persons
cannot prejudice the rights of others. Wherefore, although you state that some
of the heirs of him whom you allege to have been your debtor have paid you, the
others should not be pressed for settlement unless the indebtedness is proved
to be due.
Given at Byzantium, on the fifth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate
of the above-mentioned Emperors.
2. The Same Emperors and Cassars to Epicrates.
It is a well-known rule of law that a compromise made between certain parties
cannot prejudice the rights of another who is absent. Therefore, having
appeared before the Governor of the province, prove that your grandmother gave
you the slave in question, and if the Governor should find that he legally
belongs to you for this reason, he will cause him to be restored to you, for if
the others divided the slave during your absence, they could not deprive you of
any of your rights.
3. The Same Emperors and Cassars to Fortunata.
If you, along with your brother, succeeded to your mother, and your brother
entered into a compromise with the creditors of the estate with reference to
your share of the same, and did so without your consent, he could not
extinguish the right acquired by you to your share of said estate.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof October, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors.
TITLE LXI. CONCERNING REFERENCES TO THE EMPEROR.
1. The Emperor Constantine to Profuturus, Prefect of Subsistence.
When a judge thinks that the case should be referred to Us, and
does not decide between the parties, but concludes that the point upon
which he is in doubt ought to be left to Our wisdom, or if he has rendered a
judgment, he must not prevent the litigants from afterwards appealing from it,
for fear that it may be reversed, being well aware that if he does so, an
appeal can, nevertheless, legally be taken. Nothing should be sent to Us which
needs a complete examination. Whenever the judge believes that a case should be
referred to Us, he must immediately order all the litigants to be notified that
a consultation is about to take place, and if the point referred is not
sufficiently explicit, or appears to be contrary to law, the judge shall,
without any unnecessary delay, be required to place the petition upon
record.
Given at Sirmium, on the fourth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate
of Constantine, Consul for the fifth time, and Lici-nius, 312.
Extract from Novel 125, Chapter I. Latin Text.
Under the provisions of the new law, where a case has been thoroughly examined
it should be terminated by the decision, which should be formally executed,
unless an appeal is taken.
2. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Viventius, Prsetorian Prefect.
The Governors of provinces must not think that criminal cases originating in
their jurisdiction should be referred to Us unless they have previously
notified the parties that this is to be done, for only the truth will be
established when the matters are referred, whether their allegations are
refuted or confirmed by their consent.
Given on the twenty-third of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulship of
Valentinian and Valens, 365.
3. The Same Emperors and Gratian to Apodemius.
If when either reason or necessity requires Our decision in any instance, and
an opinion is expected, the submission of the reference must include the whole
case, so that, having been read, it will not be necessary for all the documents
to be reviewed; still, all of them should accompany the application.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof May, during the Consulate of Our Noble Prince
Valentinian, and Victor, 369.
TITLE LXII. CONCERNING APPEALS AND IMPERIAL DECISIONS.
1. The Decree of the Divine Severus, Published with Reference to Marcus
Priscus, on the Ides of January, during the Consulate of Pom-peianus and
Avitus, 210.
The Governor of the province must first determine the question of possession,
and then inquire into the crime of violence, and if he should not do so, there
will be good ground to appeal from his decision.
2. The Emperor Alexander to Plautianus.
What you demand is not new, hence you must not be denied the right to appeal,
even though one of My Rescripts is pleaded against you.
3. The Emperor Gordian to Victor.
It has frequently been established that, where an appeal was taken, although it
may have been rejected by the court, nothing took place to prejudice the
decision, and that everything remains in the same condition that it was when
judgment was rendered.
Published on the fourth ....
4. The Emperor Philip and the Csesar Philip to Probus.
If, having been appointed to the office of clerk, you did not appeal, the laws
cannot be violated by your refusal.
5. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Valens and Others.
If the Governor of the province, to whom you have appealed, should decide that
you were not to blame because you did not file your petition within the time
prescribed by law, but that this resulted from the death of the person who had
been charged with presenting it, he will grant you relief in accordance with
the terms of the Perpetual Edict.
6. The Same Emperors and Csesars decree:
It is proper for those who have jurisdiction of appeals, and hear them, to
dispose of them in such a way that it may be understood that the appeal was
filed after a decision was rendered by the court below, as it is not right
that, under any pretext whatever, the case should be sent back to the trial
judge, but in every instance it must be ended by its own decision; as the
salutary law enacted with reference to this provides that, after the appellate
judge has passed upon the appeal, recourse cannot be had to the magistrate from
whose decision the appeal was taken. Wherefore, judges are hereby notified
that, under no pretext whatever, can litigants be sent back to their own
provinces, as appellate judges in every instance are only permitted to
determine whether the appeal was properly taken or not.
(1) If one of the litigants should think that he has failed to make use of some
good defence in his allegations before the lower court, he can avail himself of
it before the judge who has cognizance of the appeal, as it is Our desire that
judges should only decide in conformity with justice, and that no important
evidence which may have been omitted should be excluded.
(2) When anyone, after having taken an appeal, thinks that the presence of
certain persons is necessary for him to establish the truth before the judge
who has jurisdiction of the appeal, because he believes that it was concealed,
and the judge decides that this ought to be done, the appellant should pay the
said witnesses their travelling
expenses, for justice demands that he who thinks that he is interested in
having them summoned should do this.
(3) However, with reference to those who, accused of capital offences, have
appealed from the sentences passed upon them, neither they themselves nor those
who appeal in their behalf, can do so until the case has been fully heard and
argued and judgment has been rendered, and We order that this rule shall be
observed, in order that if the defendant is unable to obtain a solvent surety
he may be kept in custody, and that the judges shall send their decisions as
well as copies of the documents filed by the appellants, together with the
replies made to them, to the court of appeal, so that the condition of the case
may be made clear to the appellate judge, and its merits having been
considered, judgment be rendered in accordance with the rights of each of the
parties.
(4) In order that the power to appeal may not be rashly and indiscriminately
granted, We decree that he who has failed to establish his case on appeal shall
be compelled by a competent judge to pay a reasonable penalty.
(5) Where, however, anyone having conducted his own case in court, and having
been defeated, desires to appeal, he must file his petition on the same day, or
on the next after judgment has been rendered. He who is transacting the
business of another must, under the same circumstances, appeal within three
days.
Extract from Novel 23, Chapter I. Latin Text.At present, the term of ten days
from the date of the judgment is granted in which to file an appeal.
END OP THE EXTRACT.
THE TEXT OP THE CODE FOLLOWS .
(6) The judge shall, without delay, notify the other party that an appeal has
been taken, even when the appellant does not request it, but the former is by
no means required to furnish security to conduct his side of the appeal.
Without date or designation of Consulate.
7. The Same Emperors and Caesars to Nero.
If those who have been appointed to civil offices, to the decurionate, or to
any other honors, even though they may have been released from the discharge of
their duties by the Emperor, do not avail themselves of the aid of an appeal,
they will be considered to have confirmed their appointments by their own
consent. Therefore, as you have been appointed to a public office, and have
appealed, prove before the Governor of the province that you have done so for a
good reason.
8. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Opimiamiis.Where a decision has been
rendered against someone who is more than twenty-five years of age, and an
appeal was not taken within
the time prescribed by law, and the Governor of the province ascertains that
the matter was not settled by compromise while the appeal was pending, he shall
see that the judgment is executed.
9. The Same Emperors and Caesars to Our Dear Haberad.
The principal party in the case can himself prosecute an appeal which his
attorney has taken in the course of the proceedings, even during the absence of
the latter.
10. The Same Emperors and Csssars to Titian.
If an attorney appointed by a curator should lose the case, he himself as well
as the curator can invoke the aid of appeal, or the curator alone can exercise
that right. If, however, the minor should, in the meantime, claim the
indulgence due to his age, or attain his majority, he can, in his own name,
conduct the appeal.
Ordered on the day before the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
11. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Antoninus.
Citizens, and the inhabitants of towns who have good excuses and did not appeal
after having legally been appointed to office, will not be permitted to
establish the trust of their allegations.
12. The Emperor Constantine to Catulinus.
Where an appeal has been filed in a civil case it is, under no circumstances,
allowed for the appellant to be kept in prison, or subjected to any kind of
injury whatsoever, or be tortured or even exposed to insult. It is, however,
otherwise in criminal prosecutions, for in these, even if an appeal can be
taken, the defendant must be kept in custody until the case has been decided
after the appeal, if he is not able to furnish a surety who is solvent.
Adopted on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of
Volusianus and Annianus, 314.
13. The Same Emperor to Petronius Probianus, Greeting.
From the time when proceedings in civil cases were instituted between private
individuals, and you determined to consult or refer them to Us, or you admitted
the appeal, and complied with the requisite legal formalities, nothing
afterwards should be permitted or performed by you in any way, even if any
evidence of Our favor should be produced, but you must, in obedience to former
laws, do all that is required and see that the case is sent to the Imperial
Court.
Published during the Idesof October, during the Consulate of Sabinus and
Rufinus, 316.
14. The Same Emperor to Bassus, Prefect of the City.
Litigants have a right to immediately appeal orally, without doing so in
writing, if the circumstances of the judgment demand it, and this applies to
civil as well as to criminal cases.
Given at Sirmium, on the eighth of the Idesof June, during the Consulate of
Gallicanus and Bassus, 317.
15. The Same Emperor to Severus Vicegerent.
In order that it may not be necessary for cases which have been brought before
Us on appeal to be sent back to the lower court, We order that all necessary
information be inserted in the papers. We are compelled to be lenient in
rendering Our Decrees, as there is reason to apprehend that where a case has
not been thoroughly investigated the opportunity for further examination may be
lost. Therefore, a judge shall be liable to perpetual infamy if all the matters
stated by the litigants in the examination and the evidence are not inserted,
and cannot be found in the documents accompanying the
appeal.
Given at Aquileia, on the tenth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of
Constantine, Consul for the fifth time, and Licinius, 319.
16. The Same Emperor to Maximus.
Those also are entitled to the benefit of an appeal against whom judgment has
been rendered by a deputy appointed by the Emperor.
Given at Sirmium, on the day before the Idesof January, during the Second
Consulate of Crispus and Constantine, 321.
17. The Same Emperor to Julian, Prefect of the City.
When, after a case has been heard by any of the Praetors, an appeal is taken by
either party, the appellant must obey the judgment of the Prefect of the City.
Given at Heraclea on the third of the Nonesof August, during the Consulate of
Constantine, Consul for the seventh time, and the Caesar Constantius, Consul
for the third time, 326.
18. The Same Emperor to Victor, Collector of Taxes of the City of Rome.
As some debtors of the Treasury, when ordered to pay certain sums of money, are
accustomed to evade execution by having recourse to an appeal, which they do
not afterwards attempt to prosecute, it has been decided that if they do not
comply with all the formalities prescribed by law within the proper time, the
appeal shall be held to have been abandoned, and the amount due shall
immediately be collected.
Given on the day before the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of
Constantius and Maximus, 327.
19. The Same Emperor to All the Inhabitants of the Provinces.
We permit appeals to be taken from the decisions of Proconsuls, counts, and
those who preside in the place of prefects, whether the decisions have been
made on appeal, after delegation, or under ordinary jurisdiction, but the judge
must give a copy of the decision to the appellant, as well as send to Us all
the pleadings of the parties, together with the arguments on both sides, as
well as his own decision.
We do not permit an appeal to be taken from the decisions of Praetorian
Prefects. If the defeated party can show that he applied for an appeal, but
that the judge refused to entertain it, he can go before the Prefect and begin
the case again just as if an appeal had been taken. If the appellant is shown
not to have appealed on proper grounds, and loses his case, he shall be.
branded with infamy. If, however, he should succeed, the judge who refused to
receive his appeal must be prosecuted before Us, in order that he may be
properly punished.
Given at Constantinople on the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of
Bassus and Ablavius, 331.
20. The Same Emperor to Albinus.
The power of appeal is granted in cases of great as well as minor importance,
and the judge should not think that he has sustained any injury because the
litigant has had recourse to an appeal.
Given on the seventh of the Idesof April, during the Consulate of Marcellinus
and Probinus.
21. The Emperors Constantius and Constans to Lollianus, Prse-torian Prefect.
As ordinary judges frequently hold that appeals should be rejected, it is
hereby decreed that if any judge should refuse to permit an appeal to be taken,
which is not against the execution of the judgment but against the judgment
itself, which has been finally rendered, he shall be compelled to pay thirty
pounds of gold to the Treasury of Our Largesses, and his officer shall also be
required to pay the same amount, unless he can show that he obstinately
resisted, and opposed, in writing, the decision rendered by the judge.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Arbitio
and Lollianus, 355.
22. The Same Emperor to Volusianus, Prsetorian Prefect.
Where a judgment has been rendered with reference to property which has no
owner, or that of which persons have been deprived by law as being unworthy to
hold it, and anyone thinks that an appeal should be taken, his right to do so
shall be admitted.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Arbitio and
Lollianus, 355.
23. The Same Emperor to the Senate.
When an appeal is taken from judgments rendered in Bithynia, Paphlagonia,
Lydia, the Islands of the Hellespont, Phrygia, Europe, Rodope, and Mount Hemus,
the appellant must comply with the decision of the Prefect of this City.
24. The Emperor Valentinian and Valens to the Council of the City of Carthage,
Greeting.
The necessity is imposed upon judges not only to permit an appeal to be taken,
but also to remember that the term of only thirty days is
granted from the date of the judgment within which the parties litigant are to
be notified that an appeal has been granted. The judge and his officer shall be
liable to a fine if they fail to observe these rules in
every particular.
Given at Milan, on the day before the Nonesof February, during the Consulate of
the Divine Jovian and Varonianus, 364.
25. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Sya-grius, Prsetorian
Prefect.
We order that appeals from judgments imposing fines shall be
permitted.
Given on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Gratian,
Consul for the fifth time, and Theodosius, 380.
26. The Same Emperors to Pelagius, Count of Private Affairs.
Let an appeal to Your Excellency be taken from the decision of the Imperial
Procurator, so that if the trifling value of the property involved, or the
distance, does not permit the litigants to appear in your court, refer the
matter to the Governor of the province for his decision, if you should approve
of this being done.
Given at Milan, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate
of Arcadius and Bauto, 385.
27. The Emperors Theodosius, Arcadius, and Honorius to Evodius, Proconsul of
Africa.
Appointments made by notices or edicts without public authority are not valid,
and if the proper formalities have not been complied with, it is not necessary
to appeal from them.
Given at Milan, on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof January, during the
Consulate of Olybrius and Probinus, 395.
28. The Same Emperors to Neridius, Proconsul ofAsia-Anyone who has taken an
appeal is hereby notified that he has a right to change his mind, and withdraw
his petition, in order that the opportunity for just repentance may not be
lost.
Given at Constantinople, on the eleventh of the Kalendsof August, during the
Consulate of Arcadius, Consul for the fourth time, and Honorius, Consul for the
third time, 396.
29. The Same Emperors to Eutychianus, Prsetorian Prefect.It shall not be lawful
for persons sentenced to punishment, after having been condemned for the
enormity of their crimes, to be arbitrarily removed and held by force, and from
humane considerations, We do not refuse to persons of this kind the power to
appeal in criminal cases, provided this is done within the time prescribed by
law; so that a more careful examination may take place, where injustice is
thought to have been committed, and the safety of a man endangered through the
error or prejudice of the court.
However, if a Proconsul, the Count of the East, the Augustal Prefect, or any of
the Imperial Deputies were among the judges, it is
hereby decreed that an appeal cannot be taken to Us, but they shall have the
most ample power to execute sentence; for We desire them to have full authority
to punish those who are condemned in the manner prescribed by law, if
circumstances and the crime demand it.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Honorius,
Consul for the fourth time, and Eutychianus, 393.
30. The Same Emperors to Theodore, Prsstorian Prefect.
When anyone appeals for the reason that he wishes to avoid the judgment
rendered against him by a judge whom he regards as suspicious, he shall have
full power to do so; nor need he be apprehensive of the undue severity of
judges, as he can easily appeal from any injurious decision which they may
render, and especially as the Praetorian Prefect is the only one from whom he
is not permitted to appeal without losing his case. Therefore, all persons are
informed that the right of appeal is granted to them from the unjust decisions
of judges, and from the rulings of those who are suspected, in capital cases,
as well in those involving the loss of their fortunes.
Given at Milan, on the seventh of the Idesof June, during the Consulate of
Theodore, Consul for the fifth time, 399.
31. The Emperors Theodosius and Honorius to Asclepiodotus, Prse-torian Prefect.
If the judge of the lower court refuses to permit an appeal to be taken against
his decision, to the tribunal of Your Highness, or to the Prefecture of the
City, or if the appeal having been admitted, he should refuse to notify the
parties, the appellant shall, according to the ancient law, be entitled to the
term of a year from the date of the decision to file a complaint on account of
this injustice, as well as to prosecute the judge; or where an appeal of this
kind was not allowed after having been requested of the judge of the lower
court, the appellant will be entitled to six months for the purpose of doing
these things.
If, however, the judge should refuse to grant the appeal, or to refer the case
to the proper magistrate, four months shall be granted, so that those acts
which We have prescribed having been performed, the appellant may proceed
during the time known to have been fixed by law for the prosecution of appeals.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Kalendsof April, during the
Consulate of Asclepiodotus and Marinianus, 423.
32. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Cyrus, Prsetorian Prefect.
We order that hereafter there shall be no recourse to Us by appeal from the
decisions of judges of distinguished rank, lest the rights of others may seem
to be infringed if We are called upon to consider them, and are called away
from the occupations which We are pursuing for the general welfare. If,
however, a case should be appealed from the decision of any of the Proconsuls,
or the Augustal Prefect, or from
that of the Count of the East, or of any of the Vicegerents of the Emperor, We
order that the illustrious Praetorian Prefect, who is a member of Our retinue,
as well as the illustrious Quaestor of Our Palace, shall take cognizance of the
appeal in the same order, and with the observation of the same formalities, and
at the same times as other actions taken up in one appeal are decided in the
Imperial Council; and this shall be done, even though some of the eminent
magistrates aforesaid have the right, as judges, to hear appeals.
(1) When an appeal is taken from a decision of a duke who is at the same time a
Governor, the Prefect shall be required to hear and determine the same, in
accordance with the ordinary rules of his tribunal.
(2) In all the different judicial proceedings which We have introduced instead
of references to Us, or the notices or other matters connected with the same,
where an appeal is taken from the decision of a judge, the above-mentioned
distinguished magistrates must hear the appellants and take cognizance of their
demands, and We order Our secretaries to obtain the papers and record them, and
notify the parties litigant, and the officials associated with the illustrious
Quaestor shall execute the judgments.
(3) These rules shall apply where an appeal was taken from the decision of a
judge who did not hear the case by virtue of a special appointment, for when
the time of the execution of a judgment is extended by an appeal from the
decision of a judge who was specially designated for that purpose, it will be
necessary for the magistrate who appointed him to ascertain whether or not
there is good ground for an appeal.
(4) We think that it is eminently proper to add to this most salutary law that
if the Emperor, after having been applied to, should assign the case to a
private individual, or to one or more persons who are not of illustrious rank,
to be heard (as is customary), and an appeal should be taken from the decision
of the person thus appointed, the illustrious Praetorian Prefect, who is one of
Our retinue, shall hear and decide the case along with the illustrious
Qusestor, at the proper time.
Our secretaries shall receive and record all matters heard and decided by Our
arbiters, and notify the litigants in writing, and they shall also receive and
examine any appeals taken from the awards of arbiters especially appointed by
Us (even though they be of illustrious rank) provided the cases are referred to
the Council of the Empire.
(5) But when an appeal is taken from the decision of the illustrious and
distinguished judges who do not belong to the court of last resort, We order
that it shall be heard by Us, even though it may have been taken from the
decision of someone who was appointed by Us to decide it, and who was not
originally of illustrious rank, but was afterwards raised to the dignity of a
noble.
The same rule shall also be observed when another arbiter also not of noble
birth is associated with him.
(6) Moreover, anything which has not been expressly stated in this law shall be
understood to remain subject to the rules of the ancient laws and
constitutions.
33. The Same Emperors to Cyrus, Prsetorian Prefect.
In a case in which the attendant of an officer of the rank of general, with
reference to whose status a controversy arises in a province on the ground that
he is a decurion, or is a member of the retinue of the Governor, and is
detained in the province for the reason that he has not paid his taxes, or
discharged his official duties, and the decision of the Governor of the
province is not executed, for the reason that an appeal has been taken from the
same, We order that the case shall be decided by Your Highness, along with the
distinguished general, according to its merits, even though the general may
have appointed the Governor of the province to hear it.
34. The Emperor Justinian to Demosthenes, Prsetorian Prefect.
We decree that when any judge of superior or inferior rank suggests that a
matter which We appointed him to decide, or which he should determine as
belonging to his jurisdiction, should be referred to Us, the case which has
been appealed shall be decided by Us in Council, whether his opinion
accompanied the reference or not (provided he did not state it to the parties)
; or if nothing of this kind was added, but he simply requested a reply from
Our Majesty, the case should not be determined until Our order, two illustrious
men who are either of patrician, consular, or prefectorian rank, and whom We
have selected for that purpose, are ordered to be joined with the illustrious
Quaestor of Our Palace, and with him examine the appeal (whether they do so in
the presence or the absence of the parties to the suit), and give their opinion
concerning the case; and the decision made by these most eminent magistrates
shall be considered as final; and permission shall not be given to appeal from
it, or to raise any doubt whatever concerning the same.
We decree that this rule shall not only apply where a single judge has referred
a case of this kind to Us, but where two or more judges were appointed and none
of them agreed, but each one submitted a different opinion for Our
consideration; or where they all consulted Us as to what disposition should be
made of the case.
35 and36. Laws which are not Authentic.
37. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Prsstorian Prefect.
We think that the following should be added where appeals are taken by which it
is customary to bring matters for final determination to the Imperial Palace,
namely, when the amount in dispute does not exceed ten pounds of gold, one
judge alone, and not two (as was formerly the practice) shall be appointed to
decide it. If, however, the value of the property exceeds that amount but is
not more than twenty pounds of gold, the matter shall be submitted to two
illustrious judges, who will take cognizance of the question involved, which
must
be reduced to writing by the clerks, so that if they differ, they may call in
the illustrious Quaestor, and the doubt be disposed of by his
decision.
In actions, however, where the property involved exceeds in value the sum of
twenty pounds of gold, they should be brought before the distinguished nobles
who compose the Council of State of Our Sacred Palace, so that, in accordance
with what has already been established, not only the defeated party but also
the one who is successful may have the case referred to one or two judges, but
this must be done within the term of two years, as, after that time has
elapsed, We refuse to authorize it. Any decisions made by one or more of these
judges shall, under no circumstances, be subject to appeal. We, however, permit
new allegations to be made by the litigants before the said judge or judges,
just as in the case of a reference to the Council of Our Sacred Palace.
Given at Constantinople, on the eighth of the Idesof April, during
the Consulate of Decius, 329.
38. The Same Emperor to Demosthenes, Prsetorian Prefect.
Where an appeal was taken from the decision of a duke, whether under his
regular jurisdiction, or whether he was especially appointed to hear the case
by the Emperor, or whether he himself was included among the eminent
magistrates, or was of illustrious rank, or even if he was of higher position
(as military men as well as those of consular rank often discharge duties of
this kind when required to do so by the public welfare), no distinction being
made on this account, but only the ducal dignity being considered, the appeal
having been taken from the decision of any duke whomsoever, shall not, as was
formerly the case, be disposed of by the judges, but We order that it shall be
referred to and decided by the most sublime Master of the Offices, and the most
excellent Qusestor of Our Palace, who shall hear it together, as is done in Our
Council of State, and that it shall be recorded by Our Imperial Secretaries,
and that none of the provisions of the ancient law with reference to such cases
shall be observed, but it shall only be brought before the said most eminent
magistrates.
39. The Same Emperor to Julian, Prsetorian Prefect.
We, having greater consideration for Our subjects than they themselves would
perhaps display, do hereby amend an ancient rule, that is to say, in cases of
appeal, he alone who had recourse to such a proceeding is entitled to have the
decision of the judge corrected, but the other party who failed to do this is
compelled to obey the decision, no matter what it may be.
Hence We order that if the appellant should come into court, and state the
grounds for appeal, and his adversary wishes to contest the judgment, and is
prepared, he can do so, if his position is worthy of the attention of the
court. But when he is absent the judge must, nevertheless, use his authority to
protect his rights.
(1) Moreover, with reference to the legal documents required for the appeal,
which, by all means, must be read before the distinguished
and learned men composing the Imperial Council, the parties litigant, as well
as those who draw up said documents, must be careful not to use too many words,
and not to repeat statements which have already been made therein, but they
must only insert those things which set forth the causes for the appeal,
expressed in concise language, and must see that they do not contain any new
matter, or make additions to supply what was omitted, for they are hereby
notified that if this is not done, those who drew up the papers will be liable
to the just indignation of the judges of the court of appeal, for a succinct
statement of the facts and an abridgment of the opinions of the eminent
magistrates who originally heard the case will be amply sufficient.
(2) We remember that, by a law which We recently promulgated, We order that one
judge should be appointed to hear cases in which a sum up to the value of ten
pounds of gold is involved, and that two should be appointed when the value was
twenty pounds of gold, in accordance with the custom observed in cases brought
before the Imperial Council.
But as, at first sight, the amount might not appear to be so large, and in the
final decision the judge or judges concluded that a greater one should be
considered, and since it was not possible for them to exceed the limits by
which they were bound, We grant them full power in cases of this kind to adopt
a larger sum than that above mentioned, if the value of the property was more
than originally estimated by them, and they shall be permitted to render their
decision in conformity to the truth, and not in accordance with the first
appraisement, in order that magistrates may not be impeded in the discharge of
their duties, but may strictly enforce observance of the laws, and in every
respect exert their judicial authority.
Given at Constantinople, on the sixth of the Kalendsof April, during the fifth
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
TITLE LXIII.
CONCERNING DELAYS, AND THE AMENDMENTS OF APPEALS OR REFERENCES TO THE EMPEROR.
1. The Emperor Constantine to Crispinus.
If anyone, having been appointed duumvir, or honored with any other office, or
invested with any public charge during his absence, should invoke the aid of
appeal, he will only be entitled to the term of two months in which to file his
application, to be computed from the time when he can show that he was first
notified of his appointment; but if he was present, the said term of two months
must be computed from the very day when his appointment was made.
Given on the eighth of the Idesof July, during the Consulate of Constantine,
Consul for the sixth time, and the Caesar Constantius, 820.
2. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Cyrus, Praetorian Prefect.
We think that it will be to the advantage of Our reign for the provisions of
the laws having reference to time granted to litigants to be amended, and that
pretexts for delay should, under all circumstances, be abolished. We order
that, after an appeal has been granted, the time allowed for the prosecution of
the same, whether this has been done by the illustrious Governor of the
province, or by an eminent judge, shall, in the first place, be six months. If
the appellant permits this time to go by, We grant him an additional term of
thirty-one days. If he should let this pass, We allow him, in like manner, a
third term of the same number of days. If the third term should also expire, We
decree that he shall be entitled to a fourth and final term of thirty-one days.
If the appellant should also let this fourth term elapse, We decree that he
shall be granted the term of three months longer, to petition Us to have his
right to appeal restored. This application having been made, We decree that it
will not be necessary to notify his adversary or to mention the time which has
expired, in his petition, but We direct that the term of three months shall be
computed from the date of the expiration of the fourth and last term, even
though restoration of his right of appeal was granted one day before, or the
judgment was not rendered by one of the illustrious Prefects.
These rules shall not prejudice the adverse party, as the expiration of the
time is not uncertain, but is well known to all persons, and they apply to
appeals from the decisions of the illustrious Governors of provinces, as well
as from those of eminent judges. Where an appeal is taken from the decision of
an arbiter in a province, who has been specially appointed by the Emperor, We
authorize three similar terms, after the first one has expired (as above
stated) to which the appellant shall be entitled, but he shall have no
restoration of his right to appeal granted by Us, so that, after the ninety-
three days shall have elapsed, the execution of the judgment must be ordered.
If, however, the arbiter was specially appointed in this Most Holy City, by the
Praetorian Prefect,, the Master of the Offices, or any other official of
exalted rank, and the appeal should be taken against either the ruling or
decision rendered by the lower court, the first term within which it can be
brought shall consist of two months, but the other three shall be computed as
above set forth. Anyone who takes an appeal from the decision of an arbiter,
who has been specially appointed by the Governor of a province, or an eminent
judge, shall be entitled to two months in which to file it, and also for three
other terms as above enumerated.
With reference to the observance of the terms aforesaid, We order that if they
should happen to occur during holidays, those which precede them may be counted
by the litigants as available.
If anyone, without observing the provisions of the law, should permit the time
to elapse, he can be opposed in the first instance by his adversary, or by the
judge if the appellant alone is present in
court, and the latter shall be considered as having accepted the decision
without having been subjected to any restraint.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Valentinian,
Consul for the fifth time, and Anatolius, 440.
Extract from Novel 29, at the Beginning. Latin Text.
A year is granted to the party who takes an appeal, within which time he must
prosecute it, either alone or in company with his adversary ; or, where there
is good reason for doing so, he may be granted still another year, and if the
case has not been disposed of at the expiration of that time, the decision will
stand confirmed.
If the appellant has failed to proceed when only one month remains of the term
of two years, the successful party will have the right to have him summoned,
and whether he is found or not, the former can make his allegations, and the
decision shall be either affirmed or set aside; and, in every instance,
judgment for the costs, dependent upon the number of terms which have been
granted, shall be rendered against the absent party. If, after the lapse of the
term of two years, neither of the parties should appear, the decision shall be
affirmed.
Extract from Novel 93, Chapter I. Latin Text.
Where, however, arbiters are chosen by the parties after an appeal has been
taken and brought before the appellate court, whether it has been heard or not,
and, in the meantime, the term of two years within which the appeal must be
disposed of in accordance with law has expired, and, for this reason, the case
again comes under the jurisdiction of the appellate judge, the parties will not
be prejudiced by the lapse of time; but the case can proceed and reach a
legitimate termination, even if ten thousand more terms of two years have
elapsed, unless the said term of two years shall have expired after the
judgment was rendered without an appeal having been taken.
Extract from Novel 23, Chapter II. Latin Text.
Where a case is intended to be referred to the Imperial Council, it will not be
prejudiced by delay until the Emperor himself has brought it to the attention
of the Council, and it has been finally disposed of in the ordinary way by the
illustrious dignitaries composing the same.
Extract from Novel 119, Chapter IV. Latin Text.
When an appeal has been taken, and one or both of the parties have been granted
more time, or only one of them has availed himself of the right to appeal, and
has appeared before the judge who is to examine the appeal, or before his
advisors, or those who present cases to the court, and the judge appoints a
certain time for the case to be heard, We do not wish the rights of either or
both of the parties to be prejudiced on this account, but that, after this,
appeals of this kind shall be examined and terminated by decisions in
accordance with law.
3. The Emperor Justini-an to Appio, Praetorian Prefect.Let no one think that,
in the future, he will be permitted to appeal to the members of the Imperial
Council after the legally established
terms have expired, either by means of a petition, or through a Rescript of the
Emperor granting him restitution of his right, nor in any other way whatsoever;
but all persons shall be required to use due diligence for the purpose of
taking advantage of appeals within the time fixed by law, and a statement of
what has taken place in the lower court and has been made the basis of appeal
shall not be filed in the office of the Imperial Secretary near the expiration
of the term, lest, by evil schemes, the termination of the case may be
interfered with, but this shall be done immediately after the appeal has been
taken, or at least before half of the prescribed period has elapsed, in order
that the party who has appealed may not lose his right on account of the little
time that remains.
4. The Same Emperor to Tatianus, Master of the Offices.
We decree by this Imperial lav; that where appeals are taken to the Emperor
permission shall be given to the appellant, as well as the adverse party, to
make use of new allegations or exceptions which may, indeed, not be applicable
to the new proceeding, but arise from and are connected with questions known to
have been brought up before the lower court.
If, however, it should be shown that any allegation was made, or any document
introduced before the lower court, proof of which the party employing it was
not able to present at that time, but which can now be done without delay
before the members of the Imperial Council, they should admit it, in order
that, by doing so, more light may be thrown upon the matters in dispute.
5. The Same Emperor to Tribonian, Qusestor of the Imperial Palace.
As by former laws, in case of appeals, provision was not made for the time
occupied by parties residing at a distance from Our Most Sacred Court, it
appears to Us to be necessary to establish a proper scale for these distances.
Therefore, We order that when any case is appealed from the frontier of Egypt,
or Lydia, or from the Orient, or from both Cilicias, or from the Armenians, as
well as from all Illyria, the term of six months shall be granted, as by the
ancient law, and this shall neither be diminished or increased. When, however,
a case is appealed from any other portion of Our Empire, as, for instance, from
the Departments of Asia, Pontus, or Thrace, to this Royal City, We order that,
instead of the term of six months above mentioned, only that of three shall be
conceded, and the other three terms which follow shall consist of three months,
that is to say ninety-three days, whether the first term of six months or the
other one of three is allowed, according to the enumeration of the places which
We have just made; but the other period of three months, which .is usually
granted by the Council for the purpose of reinstating the party in his right of
appeal, shall remain unaltered, and shall be added to those previously
designated, so that, in one instance, the term allowed shall consist of a year,
and in the other of nine months.
(1) As, in former times, one day was granted by the ancient legislators at the
end of each term, which was designated "The Fatal
Day," and it often happened (as mortals are exposed to many accidents) when
appeals were taken, that either from illness, length of time, or other causes
(which would not be easy to remember or enumerate), the said fatal day passed
without the parties taking advantage of it, and the time for appealing expired,
and the estates of men were thereby endangered, We, for the purpose of
disposing of these injurious vicissitudes of fortune, do order that hereafter
not merely one fatal day shall be reckoned, but if the appellant shall have
appeared at any time within four days preceding the fatal day, or within five
days after that time, and shall bring his action before a competent judge, the
law shall be considered to have been complied with. He should not be expected
to deplore the loss of his case, but he ought to rejoice in the privilege We
bestow upon him, as We are aware that suits are frequently endangered through
an error in calculation as to the time within which the judge should act, which
it is to be hoped will not occur hereafter, because of the remedy afforded
under the present law.
This privilege is applicable to all delays, whether they have been granted by
specially appointed judges or by others, and which the laws have mentioned as
being required to be kept or observed, so that ten fatal days, instead of only
one, shall everywhere be established.
(2) In those instances, however, with reference to which the term of two years
has been prescribed, whenever cases are heard in this Imperial City by the
assembled Council of the Nobles of Our Sacred Palace, We limit the time to one
instead of two years, so that within that period the papers in the case may be
collected, and delivered to Our devoted Secretaries, and the arguments in
opposition be made', if this should be desirable, and the litigants be
compelled to bring the case before Our Imperial Council. A successful party
shall, in accordance with what has already been decided, be permitted to
present his case there at once, without waiting for the expiration of a year,
if he should wish to do so.
(3) When, however, proceedings have been begun in Our Imperial Council, and
have not been concluded on the same day, We permit them to be continued, as it
would be unjust for men to lose their cases for the reason that the Imperial
Council was occupied with matters brought before it by the Emperor.
(4) We think that it is reasonable for what follows to be added to this law,
namely: that if anyone should have taken his case before an appellate judge,
prior to the expiration of the time prescribed by law (whether one or both
parties were present), and, having formulated his appeal, should afterwards
depart and abandon it, and the remainder of the time should pass in inactivity,
and the term of a year elapse after the case was begun, the successful party
not being able to have the judgment executed on account of the case being still
incomplete, and not having the power to bring it to a conclusion, as the
absence of the appellant, did not, of itself, cause it to be terminated, We,
for the purpose of removing this injustice (as the adverse party can, even in
the absence of the appellant, proceed with the case, for
the reason that the special privilege enjoyed by the magistrate having
jurisdiction of an appeal authorizes him to dispose of it when only one party
is present), do hereby order that if the said appellant does not attend to the
case, and conduct it to the end, when he was to blame because the trial did not
proceed, he will forfeit his right of appeal, and the judgment rendered against
him shall remain in full force and effect, just as if an appeal had not been
taken in the first place, unless the said appellant can establish by perfectly
clear evidence that he intended to use every effort to have the case heard, but
was unable to do so, either through the fault of the judge, or for some other
cause over which he had no control. For, under such circumstances, We grant him
another term of a year, and if this should elapse, and the case not be
terminated within that time, We decree that he shall be deprived of the benefit
of an appeal, because he had full power to appear before Us, and complain of
the delay of the judge, and profit by Our indulgence.
(5) In conformity with the above, the same rule shall apply to appeals from the
decisions of Our distinguished Prefects brought before Our Imperial Council, on
the application of one or both parties, not only because of the absence of one
of them, but also on account of the expiration of the terms prescribed by law.
(6) Moreover, if the parties came to the conclusion that their dispute should
be settled by means of a written agreement, neither of them shall have the
right to invoke the aid of an appeal, or take advantage of the lapse of time,
and We decree that a compromise of this kind shall stand, for under such
circumstances, We desire the harshness of the laws to be mitigated by the
agreement of the litigants.
Given at Chalcedon, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof December, during the
fifth Consulate of Decius, 526.
TITLE LLXXIIVV..WHEN IT is NECESSARY TO APPEAL.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Apollinarus and Others.
You allege that the sentence has no force, as it was pronounced in opposition
to a judgment from which no appeal was taken. If you can prove this readily,
without having recourse to an appeal, what has been decided will not have the
authority of a judicial decision.
Published on the eighth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of
Alexander, 223.
2. The Same Emperor to Capilaneis.
When a question with reference to the succession of the deceased arose between
you and your grandmother, and a judge appointed by the Governor of the province
decided that the deceased, although under the age of fourteen years, could make
a will, and by this means you obtained the advantage over your grandmother, it
is evident that the decision having been rendered in violation of a plain rule
of law can
have no force; therefore, in this instance, it will not be necessary to have
recourse to an appeal. If, however, an inquiry was made as to the age of the
deceased, and it was ascertained that he had completed his fourteenth year, and
the judge decided that for this reason he could make a will, and you did not
appeal, or you failed to prosecute the appeal after it was taken, you cannot
again bring up a matter which has been decided.
3. The Emperor Gordian to Ingenuus.
If (as you allege) you were appointed to the duumvirate, and your previous
designation as decurion was suspended on account of the appeal which you made
to the eminent judges against your selection for the latter office, it is clear
that your appointment to the duumvirate will not be prejudiced before your
appeal has been disposed of by the above-mentioned judges.
4. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus, and the Caesar Valerian to Julianus.
As you state that several magistrates have been appointed judges in your case,
and that only one of them has rendered a decision, there does not seem to be
any necessity to appeal, as the decision is not valid in law.
5. The Emperors Cams, Carimis, and Numerianus to Domitian.
Governors can impose fines within certain limits. If the Governor of the
province should exceed his authority, and fine you more than the amount
prescribed by law, there is no doubt that what appears to have been done
illegally is void, and can be set aside without appeal.
Published during the Idesof January, during the Consulate of Carus and Carinus,
283.
6. The Same Emperors to Germanus.
If the judge appointed by the Governor of the province to hear the case is said
not to have rendered his decision on the day that the Governor appointed, but a
considerable time afterwards, in order to avoid the introduction of
technicalities and the delay which will result from a fruitless appeal, the
Governor of the province must decide the entire case, without it being
necessary to have recourse to an appeal.
7. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Nicagora.
It has already been decreed by our Imperial Predecessors that decisions
rendered by corrupt judges for the sake of reward are void in law, even if no
appeal should be taken.
8. The Same Emperors to Constantine.
If your father did not give his consent to your appointment as decurion, and
you were still in the fifteenth year of your age, and the Governor of the
province, having been applied to, should find that you are not eligible to the
said office of decurion, he will revoke the unjust
appointment as being void on account of your age, even if no appeal was taken.
9. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Rufina.
We grant to veterans who, after service in the legions or under the standards
for twenty years, have obtained an honorable and regular discharge, the
privilege of being exempt from onerous public duties. Moreover, desiring to
remunerate the faithful devotion of Our soldiers by this mark of Our
indulgence, We hereby release them from the necessity of appealing, when
judgments are rendered against them.
10. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Prsetorian Prefect.
For the sake of maintaining unimpaired the honor of judges, where one of the
parties, considering himself injured by their final decision, takes an appeal,
We forbid the other party, who was successful, to appeal from the same judgment
on the ground that he did not receive anything as costs and damages in the
case, or received less than he ought to have done, as he himself admits that
the decision was justly rendered. The judges, however, or the nobles of Our
Imperial Palace, when the amount involved in the case is not of great value,
and they think that the successful party is entitled to his expenses, have
power to grant him a reasonable sum for that purpose, without rendering it
necessary for him to appeal. And as he is permitted by former laws to apply for
this relief, if his adversary should fail to appeal to Our Council, We
nevertheless authorize this to be done, but We forbid any imputation to be cast
upon the court by taking an appeal when it is unnecessary.
Given on the eighth of the Idesof April, ....
TITLE LXV. WHOSE APPEALS SHOULD NOT BE RECEIVED.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Sabinus.
The appeal of a party who, being absent through obstinacy, has had judgment
rendered against him after having been regularly summoned to conduct his case,
cannot be received, if the matter has previously been summarily examined.
Published on the Nonesof July, during the Consulate of Antoninus, Consul for
the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
2. The Emperors Constantius and Constans to Hierocles, Consular of Syria.
You will be careful to note that no homicide, poisoner, malefactor, adulterer,
or any person who has been guilty of manifest violence, who has been convicted
by witnesses, or with his own mouth has confessed that he is guilty of vices
and crimes, shall be heard, if he takes an appeal.
We, however, wish it to be observed that justice requires that where witnesses
have been called, instruments produced, and other evidence offered, and a
judgment has been rendered against the culprit, and the latter does not confess
his guilt, or, terrified by the fear of torture, states anything against
himself, he shall not be denied the right of appeal.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof December, during the Consulate of Leontius and
Sallust, 344.
3. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Modestus, Praetorian Prefect.
An appeal from the decision of his own judge is not permitted to any official,
except solely where, in a civil proceeding, he has brought suit before his own
judge with reference to an estate, but any official can, under other
circumstances, appeal from the sentence of the said judge, and the right is
granted him by law to appear by an attorney.
Given on the fourth of the Idesof June, during the Consulate of Valentinian and
Valens, 365.
4. The Emperors Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian to Olybrius, Prefect of the
City.
We order that no appeal shall be taken where satisfaction of a claim is
demanded by the Treasury, or where the payment of public taxes is in question,
or the recovery of a debt, either public or private is involved (provided that
the indebtedness has been clearly proved), so that judicial authority may be
severely exercised against the delinquent if guilty of contumacy.
Published at Rome, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof September, during the
second Consulate of Valentinian and Valens, 368.
5. The Emperors Valens, Gratian, and Valentinian to Thalassius, Proconsul of
Africa.
It has been thoroughly established by the laws and Imperial Constitutions that
an appeal cannot be taken from an execution, unless the officer charged with it
has exceeded the terms of the judgment. When an appeal of this kind is taken,
We think that it should be held that the execution is suspended, and if the
property, which the officer charged with the execution attempted to return, is
movable, it should be taken from the possessor and sequestered after the
appeal, to be restored eventually to the party whom the judge may decide is
entitled to it.
Where, however, execution was issued with reference to either the possession or
the ownership of property, and it is suspended by an appeal, all the profits
acquired therefrom during the time of the appeal, or subsequently obtained,
shall be placed on deposit, and the land left temporarily in the hands of the
appellant. Litigants, however, are notified that, if they appeal either from
the execution of the judgment, or from the judgment itself, and it should
appear that they have done so wrongfully, they shall be fined the sum of fifty
pounds of gold.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof February, during the Con-
sulate of Valens, Consul for the sixth time, and Valentinian, Consul for the
second time, 378.
6. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Hypa-tius, Prefect of
the City.
Anyone who has ventured to appeal against the opening of the will of a deceased
person, or to prevent those who, it is evident, have been appointed heirs, from
being placed in possession of the estate, if the judge having jurisdiction
should hold that the appeal which has been interposed in such a matter ought to
be received, he who appealed so improperly shall pay a fine of twenty pounds of
silver, and the judge who connived at such a base proceeding shall be fined an
equal sum.
Given.on the Nonesof April, during the Consulate of Ausonius, Consul for the
tenth time, and Olybrius, 379.
7. The Same Emperors and Arcadius to Pelagius, Count of Private Affairs.
No appeal shall be permitted either from interlocutory decrees or from other
judicial acts, before a final decision has been rendered in its proper order.
8. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Apollodorus, Count of Private Affairs.
The interest of the public as well as that of Our Private Treasury requires
that claims due to Our Household should not be deferred by the cunning arts of
debtors. Wherefore, We decree that the following rule shall be obeyed, namely:
that those who have been openly and manifestly ascertained to be public debtors
shall be denied the privilege of appeal, and their application for the same
shall be rejected.
Given at Milan, on the third of the Idesof August, during the Consulate of
Arcadius, Consul for the fourth time, and Honorius, Consul for the third time,
396.
TITLE LXVI.
WHERE THE APPELLANT DIES WHILE THE APPEAL is
PENDING.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Julianus.
Even after the death of the party who appealed, his heirs are required either
to continue the case on appeal, or to acquiesce in the
original decision.
Published on the third of the Nonesof December, during the Consulate of
Alexander, 223.
2. The Same to Marcellina.
My Parents ordered that the property of him who, having been accused of a
capital crime, did not appear, and died before the case was heard, should
belong to his heirs.
Published on the third of the Nonesof December, during the Consulate of
Alexander, 223.
3. The Same Emperor to Ulpius.
If anyone sentenced to exile with confiscation of his property should appeal,
and should die while the appeal is pending, although the crime vanished with
his death, still the case involving his property must proceed. For it makes a
great difference whether a capital penalty which deprives the accused of his
property has been imposed (in which case the crime, having been extinguished by
his death, no question with reference to it can survive), or whether the
property is taken, not as the result of condemnation for the crime, but by a
special decision of the Governor, for the defendant being dead, the question of
the crime alone is removed, but that of the disposition of the property
remains.
Published during the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Modestus and Probus,
279.
4. The Emperor Gordian to Alexander.
If your father, having been appointed to the decurionate and appealed, died
while the appeal was pending, the question of the appointment is terminated by
his death.
5. The Same Emperor to Felix.
Although the female slave, with reference to whose ownership a controversy
arose and a decision was rendered against you by the Governor of the province,
died, still, as an appeal was taken in the case, and as you allege that it was
pending along with other cases, this appeal should be heard and decided in its
regular order, so far as the disposal of the peculiumof said slave is
concerned.
6. The Emperor Constantine to Bassus, Prefect of the City.
If one of the litigants should die while the appeal is still pending, his heirs
will be entitled not only to the remaining time which remained to the deceased,
but also to four months in addition. Where, however, a certain time was granted
to the heirs for deliberation, after this has expired, the term of four months
more shall be granted them, in order that they, being ignorant of business, or
having doubts as to whether they should accept the estate or not, may not
suffer loss before acquiring any benefit.
Published at Sirmium, on the twelfth of the Kalendsof June, during the second
Consulate of the Csesars Crispus and Constantine, 331.
TITLE LXVII.
CONCERNING THOSE WHO DO NOT APPEAL THROUGH FEAR OF THE JUDGE.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Dorophanus.
If a judicial decision was rendered against you and you did not invoke the aid
of an appeal, you understand that you must abide by the
decision, for you need fear nothing in the presence of the Imperial
Council.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof June, ....
2. The Emperor Julian to Geminianus.
The privilege of having the right to appeal restored to them is denied to those
who did not apply within the time prescribed by law. Therefore, all who, under
the pretext of fear, fail to appeal from the decisions of Prefects of the City,
Masters of the Offices, Generals of the Army, Proconsuls, Counts, Prefects of
the East, Augustal Vicegerents, or any other magistrates whomsoever, shall be
excluded from reviving their cases. But persons who have suffered violence, and
make a public statement of the facts within the lawful time during which they
have a right to appeal, or show by their statements that they intended to do
so, shall, by reason of this fact, have the support of equity, just as if an
appeal had been taken.
Published on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of
Mamertinus and Nevitta, 362.
TITLE LXVIII. WHERE ONE OR MORE OF THE PARTIES APPEAL.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Licinius.
If it is proved to the court that the same judgment was rendered against you as
against the party whose appeal was decided to be just, and that there was no
separation on account of any difference of facts in the case, he will not fail
to see that you also, who did not appeal, shall profit by the success of the
other party, in accordance with what has frequently been decided.
Published on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof September, ....
2. The Same Emperor to Serenus.
When one of several parties in the same case appeals and his 'appeal is decided
to be just, it will also benefit those who did not appeal. Where, however, one
of them obtained restitution in opposition to the judgment, on the ground of
his age, this will be of no advantage to another who is older, but did not
appeal in his own name.
TITLE LXIX.
WHERE AN APPEAL is TAKEN AGAINST TEMPORARY POSSESSION.
1. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Eusig-nius, Praetorian
Prefect.
Where proceedings have been instituted with reference to temporary possession,
even though an appeal may have been taken, the judgment rendered will,
nevertheless, be effective, as the question of
possession must be decided, in order that that of ownership may remain intact.
Given at Milan, on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof December, during the
Consulate of our Prince Honorius, and Evodius, 386.
TITLE LXX.
No ONE SHALL BE PERMITTED TO APPEAL POB THE THIRD TIME IN ONE AND THE SAME
CASE, OR TO REFUSE TO OBEY THE JUDGMENT OP A COURT WHICH HAS BEEN RENDERED
TWICE AND CONFIRMED BY THE DECISION OF A PREFECT.
1. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Prsetorian Prefect.
When a party has appealed a second time in a case, he shall not be permitted to
do so again with reference to the same matters, in the same suit, or to refuse
to comply with the judgment of the distinguished Praetorian Prefect.
Permission, however, is granted to litigants for whom an arbiter has been
appointed to question the jurisdiction of the judge who appointed him, before
issue had been joined, for a proceeding of this kind has by no means the effect
of an appeal.1
1 Much of the civil procedure of the Romans has been transmitted to posterity,
and some of it, under other designations, survives in the forms of Common Law
practice. The legis actiones,namely sacramenti, judicia postulatio, condictio,
manus injectio,and pignoris capiohave already been described.
These were succeeded by the Formulary System to meet the ever-increasing
requirements of a rapidly growing state, and the resultant altered conditions
of society.
Under this improved method of procedure, the ends of justice were much more
readily attained, and the interests of litigants preserved from injury and
loss, than under the harsh and inflexible rules which have previously
controlled the administration of the law.
It was the practice, before suit was brought, for an attempt at a compromise to
be made, in which the services of the friends and relatives of both parties
were voluntarily enlisted; if their efforts were unsuccessful, a summons, the
in jus vocatio,oral in form, was served upon the defendant in person. Anyone
who happened to be present could be called upon to witness the service, and
this having been accomplished, the plaintiff could bring his adversary into
court by main force, if necessary.
The formula ordinarily consisted of four parts: the demonstratio,or a brief
statement of the plaintiff's case drawn up by the magistrate; the
intentio,which set forth in detail his claim and the grounds on which it was
founded, as fully and concisely as possible; the condemnatio,which empowered
the court to find for either party to the suit; and the adjudicatio,which
conferred upon him the right to award the property in controversy to whichever
of the litigants he might decide was entitled to it. The first of these which
was merely a recitation of facts to define the general character of the action,
was not absolutely essential, and was, at times, dispensed with. The second,
however, contained the vital portion of the proceedings, the issue of law or
fact upon which the entire case was dependent, and it could not be omitted or
curtailed. The adjudicatiowas principally employed by heirs in actions for
partition, for the division of partnership property, and for the settlement of
the boundaries of contiguous estates, when in dispute.
The answer of the defendant, or exceptio,was filed immediately after the
intentio.
Exceptions were either perpetual or peremptory, temporary or dilatory, their
effect being evident from these designations without further explanation.
TITLE LLXXXXII..WHO CAN MAKE AN ASSIGNMENT OP THEIR PROPERTY.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Iren&us.
When the creditors of those who make an assignment of their property are not
paid in full, the latter are not released from liability, for the only
advantage they derive from doing so is that, if judgment should be rendered
against them, they cannot be placed in prison.
Given on the tenth of the ... of December, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and ^lianus, 224.
2. The Emperor Philip and the Csesar Philip to Abascantus.If you are prepared
to pay what you owe, after judgment has been rendered against you in favor of
the State, because you have hastily
If the plaintiff so desired, he could deny the allegations by means of a
replicatio,which the defendant could contest in his turn by a duplicatio,the
latter to be answered by the triplicatioof the plaintiff.
When the pleadings were terminated and accepted by the court, litis contesta-
tio,or joinder of issue, was said to have taken place. This was considered by
Roman jurists as the most critical stage of the proceedings, being their actual
commencement, and imposing new obligations upon both parties and their heirs,
for from this date he who gained the case had a right to claim all profits and
advantages arising from, or connected with, the matter in controversy, and, on
the other hand, corresponding liabilities attached to the defeated party.
Issue having been joined, both parties entered into an undertaking to appear
for trial upon a day designated by the court, a judge having previously been
appointed.
There were two kinds of judgments at civil law, known as "ordinary" and
"extraordinary": the first, where matters of law and fact were heard and
determined by different legal officials; the second, where both were disposed
of by the same magistrate. Ordinary judgments were the only ones recognized by
Roman jurisprudence for almost ten centuries.
It is doubtful whether the right of appeal was admitted under the domination of
the Kings; after that period, however, there is no question as to its existence
.and frequent exercise. During the era of the Republic an appeal could be taken
at any time during the progress of a suit, from one magistrate to another, who
was not even required to be invested with superior jurisdiction. The general
rule under the Empire was that an appeal lay from an inferior magistrate to the
Urban and Prsetorian Prefects, the jurisdiction of the latter being final, as
the Imperial representatives. The Emperor, with this Council, constituted the
court of last resort in appeals from the Urban Prefects, and ultimately the
decisions of the Praetorian Prefects could be reviewed by the sovereign,
through the employment of a proceeding called supplicatio,or petition.
The Roman judicial calendar was divided into dies fasti,on which sessions of
court could be regularly held; dies nefasti,during which all legal and secular
business was suspended, as conflicting with the worship of the gods to whom
these days were consecrated; and dies intercisi,which partook of the nature of
both the others, being partly available for the transaction of worldly affairs,
and partly devoted to the ceremonies of religion, and regarded as half
holidays. The public games celebrated in the spring and fall of each year gave
rise to protracted vacations. It was also the custom not to hold court during
vintage and harvest. Provisions of a similar character with reference to the
observance of holidays under the Christian dispensation were inserted in the
Visigothic Code and Las Siete Partidas.The Emperor Marcus Aurelius fixed the
number of judicial days at two hundred and thirty during the entire year.ED.
consented to assign your property, you need have no apprehension that you will
be deprived of your right to the same, if it has not yet been sold.
Published on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of
the Emperor Philip, and Retianus, 246.
3. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus to Julianus.
If your father made an assignment of his property on account of civil
liabilities which he had incurred, an inquiry should be made as to his means,
and the estate which you allege you acquired after your emancipation should not
be interfered with. In order that this may be accomplished, you should invoke
the justice of the Governor.
4. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Chilo.
It is a well-known fact that the benefit of the Lex Julia,having reference to
the assignment of property for the benefit of creditors, was extended by the
Constitutions of Our Divine Predecessors to the Provinces, so that such
assignments may take place there, but creditors are not allowed to divide the
said property on their own authority, and hold it by the right of ownership,
but they are obliged to sell it, and can then indemnify themselves as far as
the proceeds permit this to be done.
Therefore, you, having the possession of the property of him who assigned it to
you on the sole ground that you are his creditor, against the rule of law, it
is clear that the claimant will not be barred by the prescription of long time,
but if it is shown that he did not assign the property, but gave it to you in
payment of his debt, the Governor of the province will grant you a hearing with
reference to your ownership of the same.
5. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Myro.
The assignment of property by anyone on account of his being unable to meet
some indebtedness incurred on account of municipal offices or duties, can, by
no means, be admitted, but those who are liable must discharge their
obligations in proportion to the pecuniary resources of each.
6. The Emperor Theodosius.
In every assignment of property, no matter for what cause it is made, the
statement of the assignor alone should be required, and the precise formalities
introduced by former laws are hereby abolished.
(1) The same Emperor said: "In every assignment of property the sole statement
of the intention of the party who makes it is sufficient."
Given on the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Our Prince Honorius, and
Evodius, 386.
7. The Emperor Justinian to Julian, Prsetorian Prefect.As sons under paternal
control can hold property which is forbidden to be acquired by their fathers,
as well as peculium,not only
castrense,but also what they can obtain with the consent of the former, why
should the power to assign their property be refused them? The reason for this
is that those who are under paternal control are understood to possess nothing
in their own right, still, in order that they may not suffer injury, they
should be allowed to make an assignment, for if the head of a family is
permitted to have the weak aid of assignment on account of the fear of some
injury to which he may be subjected, why should We deny this right to children
of either sex who are under paternal control ? For it is a perfectly clear rule
of law that, where those who are under the control of others, subsequently, as
heads of families, acquire anything, this can legally be seized by creditors to
the amount of the indebtedness.
Given at Constantinople, on the tenth of the Kalendsof March, after the fifth
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
8. The Same Emperor to John, Prsetorian Prefect.When, as is customary, a
petition is presented to Us to allow someone to have recourse to the wretched
expedient of making an assignment of his property, and his creditors are given
the choice to grant him five years for payment of their claims, or to accept
the assignment, that by so doing his reputation may be preserved, and the
prospect of all bodily suffering be removed, where some of the creditors are
willing to allow the term of five years, but others insist that an immediate
assignment be made, it was constantly doubted which of them should be heard.
Where a doubt of this kind exists, We think that Our opinion should be readily
accepted by everyone, that is to say, We choose and authorize the more humane,
instead of the harsher course, and decree that the case shall be decided either
by the amount of the indebtedness, or according to the number of the creditors.
Where, however, there is one creditor whose claim is found to be greater than
all the others, that is to say, if all of them were united into one, and the
entire indebtedness computed, it would be greater in amount than the rest
combined, this decision shall prevail, whether the creditor is willing to grant
the time above mentioned or to accept an assignment of the property. But if
there are several creditors who have different claims, the one who has the
largest should be preferred to the others, whether the creditors are equal or
unequal in number, as the case should be decided, not in accordance with the
number of creditors, but by the amount of the indebtedness.
If the claims are found to be equal in amount, but the number of the creditors
is unequal, then the majority of the creditors shall obtain the preference, and
the decision shall be made in compliance with their wishes. When, however, the
debts, as well as the number of creditors are equal, then those shall be
preferred who incline to the more humane course, and do not require an
assignment of the property, but are willing to grant the time, and, with
reference to this choice, no difference shall be observed between hypothecary
and other creditors.
When an assignment is made, the judge shall exercise his authority by dividing
the property among the individual creditors, as prescribed by law, and no
prejudice shall result to any creditor from the delay of five years, so far as
prescription is concerned.
TITLE LXXII.
CONCERNING THE SEIZURE AND SALE OP PROPERTY BY AUTHORITY OF COURT, AND THE
SEPARATION OP THE SAME.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Attica.
With reference to the estate of a deceased person it is clear that the case of
legatees is preferable to that of those to whom his heir has bequeathed
property, since they can sue them, as they could have done his heir, for the
first bequest can be collected as a debt, and what has been left by the
deceased will only be available after the failure to pay it.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Aristo.
It is part of the jurisdiction of the Praetor under the Edict, after it has
been established that the creditors of an estate are entitled to indemnity,
that they shall be granted a separation of the property, whenever they demand
it, and proper cause is shown. Therefore, you will obtain what you desire, if
you can prove that you did not proceed against the heir as representing the
estate, but that you were compelled by necessity to bring him into court.
3. The Same Emperor to Claudiana.
The suit which you have brought against your debtor on the contract which
preceded the assignment of his property is contrary to the rule of law, as
equity furnishes him with the relief of an exception. You can, however, again
bring suit against him, if he has subsequently acquired other property, and the
Governor of the province should authorize you to do so.
4. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Cassars, to Clariana.
The demand which you make, namely, that one of the creditors who has a written
claim against the debtor, and has seized the property of the latter, is obliged
to satisfy all the other creditors, is contrary to law.
5. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Acyndinus.
Ifit is established that the property of your debtor is unoccupied, and it has
not been seized by the Treasury, you can lawfully demand to be placed in
possession by a competent judge.
Given on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof January, under the Consulate of ....
6. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Agattiomarus.
Creditors cannot legally demand that the property of their debtor be
transferred to them in satisfaction of their claims. Therefore, if the other
creditors of your debtor have received property by way of pledge, there is no
doubt that their claims will be preferred to yours, as you have only a written
obligation. If, however, it should be proved that the property of your creditor
is not encumbered to anyone either specially or generally, and the common
debtor himself, or his heir, died without leaving any successor, the interest
of all the creditors will be protected, not by asserting their right to the
ownership of the property, but by obtaining possession of and selling the same,
and each one should receive a share of the proceeds in proportion to the amount
of nis claim.
7. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Domnus.
If your wife has been appointed heir by her uncle, who was her debtor for the
third part of his estate, she will not be prevented from collecting the debt
from his co-heirs in proportion to their two-thirds, as the right of action is
not merged, except so far as the share of the estate to which she succeeded is
concerned. If, however, the co-heirs should be insolvent, and a separation of
property is demanded, she will not be allowed to suffer any loss.
Given on the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the Csesars.
8. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Elida.
The wife of the deceased, or other creditors who have been placed in possession
of the property of the estate for the purpose of preserving it can, by no
means, be considered to have acquired the ownership of the same for this
reason.
9. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Teruncius.
As you allege that he of whom you complain is indebted to you on account of the
administration of your business, having appeared before the Governor of the
province, you can legally bring suit against him. If it is established that he
is your debtor, and that in an attempt to defraud you of your rights, he has
concealed himself, and does not make any defence, you can, by virtue of the
Edict, obtain possession of his property, and the time prescribed by law having
expired, you will not be forbidden by a competent judge to sell the same.
Given on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of
Diocletian and Maximian.
10. The Emperor Justinian to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
In cases where money was due, and property which belonged to the debtor had not
been hypothecated to secure payment, and he, fearing the harshness of his
creditors, concealed himself, and they, having instituted proceedings with
reference to said property, demand that possession of the same should be
transferred to them, We find that the
question arose among the ancient authorities whether other creditors, to whom
he was also indebted, could share in the possession of the property, and
desiring to remove this doubt, do order by this general Imperial Constitution
that, where not all the creditors, having claims of this kind, but only certain
ones, are placed in possession of the property under a judicial decree, not
only they, but all others having such claims shall enjoy the same privilege,
and have a common interest with those who first obtained possession, and in
whose favor a decree was rendered, as above stated; for what could be more just
than that all those who are admitted to the possession of the property of the
debtor should share an advantage of this description?
But, in order that the negligence of the others may not be a source of
perpetual annoyance to those creditors who are shown to have been more diligent
in the collection of their claims, it seems to Us to be equitable to direct
that the other creditors who are not known, to have exerted such diligence
shall share in the possession of said property, and that they shall be entitled
to the term of two years if they are present and live in the same province in
which those who have possession of it reside, and in case of their absence
shall have the term of four years in which to prove their claims to the
creditors in possession and pay the expenses pro ratato those who obtained the
judgments. Those who incurred such expenses in order to obtain possession of
the property, must prove the amount of the same under oath, because it is an
established rule that they shall be reimbursed in proportion to the amount of
their claims. After the time above mentioned has expired, however, the
creditors who have obtained possession as aforesaid shall not be molested or
subjected to loss, and they can bring any actions against their debtors to
which they think that they are entitled under the laws.
(1) But if those creditors who hold possession should sell the property, either
by virtue of a judicial decree or for any other lawful reason, or if they
should transfer every right which they are known to have in said property to
other persons, after the time which has been prescribed by Us, and receive a
certain sum of money in payment for the same, anything which is found to be in
excess of what is due to them, they will, by all means, be required to seal up
in the presence of notaries, and deposit in the strong box of the Holy Church
of the town in which the said transaction took place, after a statement has
been drawn up by the notaries aforesaid, in the presence of the person who sold
the property or transferred it to other persons, in which not only the amount
of money which was paid for the sale or transfer of said property, as well as
that of the surplus which remained after the discharge of the debt, shall be
set forth, so that if any creditor should subsequently appear and produce
evidence of a debt, he can be paid out of said surplus.
If another creditor should appear, the Governor of the province shall make an
examination of his claim without any charge, and if he should not admit it, the
reverend Stewards or Treasurers of the Holy Church in which the money is
deposited shall not be subjected to any loss or expense, but the creditor shall
be entitled to receive the amount
of his debt, pro rata,,out of the money deposited under the decree of the
Governor. To prevent the creditors from practicing any fraud, machination, or
evasion in the sale or transfer of said property, We order that the statement
drawn up with reference to the transaction shall, with all the customary
formalities, be recorded in the office of the Defender of the City, whether the
amount of the price was equal to that of the debt, or whether it was more, or
less; and this should take place, not only in the presence of notaries, as
aforesaid, but also in that of the most reverend Treasurer of the Church in
whose hands the excess of the money, if there was any, was deposited under
seal.
The vendor, or the person who transferred the property, shall be required to
make oath on the Holy Scriptures that this was not done to favor either the
purchaser or him to whom the property was delivered, and that he did not
fraudulently receive a lower price for the same than it was worth, but the
highest one in fact which, after every effort, it was possible for him to
obtain.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof November, after the
fifth Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 532.
TITLE LXXIII. CONCERNING THE PRIVILEGE OF THE TREASURY.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Eutropia.
If the property of your husband was seized by the Treasury for the payment of
claims incurred during his administration as Chief Centurion of the Triarii,
any of it that you can prove beyond question to be yours shall be separated
from the rest, and returned to you.
2. The Same Emperor to Valeriana.
Although your former husband may have had judgment rendered against him on
account of your dowry, still, if he made a contract with the Treasury before
his property was encumbered to you, the claim of the Treasury will be preferred
to yours. If, however, he became liable to the Treasury after you had obtained
a lien on his property, the claim of the Treasury to said property will not
take precedence of yours.
Published on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of
Antoninus, Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
3. The Same Emperor to Juliana.
If, when you paid money for your husband, you did not have the claim of the
Treasury transferred to you, and did not receive a house or any other property
from him by way of security, you will be entitled to a personal action, but
your claim by which you allege that the taxes have again been farmed out to him
cannot be preferred to that of the Treasury, as, under the terms of that
contract, whatever property he has or did have at the time the agreement was
entered into, is encumbered to the Treasury by the right of pledge. Therefore,
with the exception of the indemnity to which the Treasury is entitled, you
will not be prevented from suing your debtor, in the ordinary way, for the sum
which you have paid in his behalf to the Treasury.
Published on the third of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Antoninus, Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
4. The Same Emperor to Quintus.
If the debtor, to whom you state that the land in question belonged, sold it
before he owed anything to the Treasury, My attorney will see that you are not
subjected to annoyance on this account, for even though he afterwards became
the debtor of the Treasury, still, any property which did not belong to him at
that time cannot, for this reason, be encumbered to the Treasury by the right
of pledge.
Published on the third of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Lsetus,
Consul for the second time, and Cerealis, 216.
5. The Emperor Alexander to Menna.
If the money which a creditor received from his debtor should afterwards be
decided to justly belong to the Treasury, it will be due without interest,
because it was acquired, not under a contract for interest, but as being the
property of the Treasury by special privilege.
Published on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of
Fuscus and Dexter, 226.
6. The Emperor Gordian to Severiana.
As you yourself state that your father was a debtor of the Treasury, and you
allege that, at the time of your marriage, he gave you possession of certain
property, you understand that the Attorney of the Treasury can institute
proceedings to revoke said gift, on the ground that said property was pledged
to the Treasury.
Published on the Nonesof June, during the Consulate of Sabinus and Venustus,
241.
7. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus, and the Csssar Valerian, to Diodorus.
If, after you have paid for a debtor to the Treasury the balance which he owed,
and a competent judge has assigned to you the right of the Treasury, and
deprived the creditors (to whom the Treasury had a preferred claim) of the
property in your favor, they cannot molest you for the reason that you hold it
by this title.
Published on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of
^milianus and Bassus, 260.
TITLE LXXIV. CONCERNING THE PRIVILEGE OF DOWRY.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Firm/us.
You should know that the dotal privilege which women avail themselves of in an
action of dowry does not pass to their heirs.
Published on the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Pompei-anus and Avitus,
210.
TITLE LXXV.
CONCERNING THE REVOCATION OF CONTRACTS BY WHICH
PROPERTY HAS BEEN ALIENATED FOR THE PURPOSE OF
DEFRAUDING CREDITORS.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Cassia.
An heir who, after having entered upon the estate, transfers it to another,
remains liable to the creditors of the estate. Therefore, if he did this for
the purpose of defrauding you, and you have seized and sold his property in the
ordinary way, you can revoke the contract by which it is proved that the
property was fraudulently alienated.
Published on the second of the Idesof October, during the Consulate of
Antoninus, Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
2. The Emperor Alexander to Symphoriana.
If you did not accept the estate of your father, his creditors cannot proceed
against you on account of the property which was given to you by way of dowry,
when it is not shown that the said property was previously pledged to them,
unless, after the estate of the deceased was found to be insufficient to pay
his debts, it should be proved that the dowry had been constituted for the
purpose of defrauding his creditors.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Ctesars, to Acindynus.
If you refused to accept the estate of your father, and none of the property of
the same was transferred to you as a donation for the purpose of defrauding
creditors, the Governor of the province will not permit you to be sued by the
private creditors of your father.
4. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Epagathus.
It is a well-known rule of law that the sons of a debtor have no power to
revoke contracts made by their father for the purpose of defrauding his
creditors.
Published on the tenth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate
of the above-mentioned Emperors.
5. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Crescentius.
It is a well-recognized legal principle that the interests of creditors shall
be protected against a person who, after judgment has been rendered against
him, does not satisfy it within the time prescribed; and no defence is made by
bringing an action in factumagainst the purchaser, where property has been sold
after the remaining assets have been found to be insufficient, and the
purchaser knowingly and fraudulently bought the property, or against him who
has possession under a lucrative title, whether he was aware of the fraud or
not.
Ordered on the tenth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
6. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Menandra.
If you have formally released an obligation, you are advised that the right to
sue is only granted by the Perpetual Edict against the party guilty of fraud,
within the year during which he could be compelled to make payment, or
committed a fraudulent act by which he became unable to do so.
THE CODE OF OUR LORD THE MOST HOLY EMPEROR JUSTINIAN.
SECOND EDITION. BOOK Vill.
TITLE I. CONCERNING INTERDICTS.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Evocatus.
As you allege that the roots of trees planted on the neighboring land of
Agathangelus threaten the safety of your house, the Governor, by virtue of the
edicts published by the Praetor, and which begin as follows, "If the tree
extends over the house of another," or "If it projects over the field of
another," and it is proved to those who have charge of such matters that no
injury can be caused to the neighbor by said trees, the question will be
decided as justice requires.
Published on the sixth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Julian,
Consul for the second time, and Crispinus.
2. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus to Messia.
The Governor of the province cannot, even by means of an interdict, proceed
against a person who is not a resident of the province.
Published on the seventh of the Kalends of May, during the Consulate of
Secularis and Donatus, 261.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Cassars, to Pompeianus,
Prsetorian Prefect.
It is a well-known rule of law that where legal proceedings have been
instituted with reference to the possession or ownership of property, the
question of possession must first be determined by a proper action, and after
this has been done, the proof of the disputed ownership shall be required of
him who was defeated in the case involving possession. But although interdicts
are not properly applicable in extraordinary proceedings, still a case of this
kind must be decided in the same manner.
Published at Sirmium, on the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
4. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to ^Emilianus, Prsetorian Prefect.
When anyone wishes to avail himself of an interdict, he must be ordered to make
his allegations, and state his case in the ordinary manner in court, avoiding
the technicalities employed by the ancients in proceedings of this description.
Published on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof . . . , during the Consulate of
Arcadius, Consul for the sixth time, and Probus, 406.
TITLE II. CONCERNING THE INTERDICT QUORUM BONORUM.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Justus.
If you intend to claim the estate which you allege belonged to your father,
prove the facts upon which you base your claim before the judges having
jurisdiction of the case. For although, after having been passed over in the
will, you have accepted praetorian possession of the estate, still, you cannot
obtain possession by virtue of the interdict Quorum bonorum,unless you can
prove that you are a son of the deceased, and that you have acquired the estate
itself, or praetorian possession of the property constituting the same.
Published on the eighth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Lateranus and Rufinus, 198.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Cassars, to Marcus.
If, by virtue of the Edict, you demanded the estate after having obtained
possession of the same (it having belonged to the sister of your paternal uncle
who died intestate, without leaving any children), and you were successful in
your application, the Governor of the province will cause the property which
belonged to her at the time of her death and which was held by others, either
as heirs or possessors of or which they have fraudulently relinquished
possession to be delivered to you, in accordance with the tenor of the
interdict Quorum bonorum.
Published on the sixth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
3. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Petronius, Vicegerent of the Spains.
It is established that a husband is excluded from the estate of his wife who
died intestate, leaving brothers, as the opinions of all jurists, as well as
the Law of Nature itself, make them her heirs. Therefore We order, all efforts
to the contrary notwithstanding, that the property shall be transferred to the
claimant under the interdict Quorum
bonorum,and that the action with reference to the ownership of the same shall
not be barred.
Given at Milan on the sixth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of
Olybrius and Probinus, 395.
TITLE III. CONCERNING THE INTERDICT QUORUM LEGATORUM.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Latina.
There is sufficient provision made for the appointed heir by the Falcidian Law,
which authorizes him to retain the fourth of the estate where it is proved to
have been exhausted by the legacies. Wherefore, if the legatee, or the
beneficiary of the trust, whom you assert succeeded the testator, accepted
possession of the estate without the consent of your father, and retained the
legacy or other property left to him by the terms of the trust, you can begin
proceedings under the interdict by which provision is made for the appointed
heirs, as against the legatees, and after having furnished the security which
must be given, you can be placed in possession of the property and retain the
fourth of the same to which you are entitled.
Given on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
TITLE IV. CONCERNING THE INTERDICT UNDE Vi.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Theodorus.
A person lawfully in possession has the right to use a moderate degree of force
to repel any violence exerted for the purpose of depriving him of possession,
if he holds it under a title which is not defective.
Published on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of
Diocletian, Consul for the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third
time, 290.
2. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Alexander.
It is a positive rule of law that, by the employment of an interdict, those who
have been forcibly ejected from property can have it restored to them if the
available year has not expired, and that the heirs shall be liable for the
amount which in the meantime has come into their hands.
Ordered during the Consulate of the above-mentioned Emperors.
3. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Ulpia and Proculina.
You made an exceedingly improper demand when you requested Us to grant you the
authority of an Imperial Rescript to confirm your
possession of property which you acknowledge you obtained by violence.
Ordered on the eighth of the Idesof April, during the Consulate
of the Caesars.
4. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Hyginus.
If you have been forcibly dispossessed, you can bring suit under the Lex
Juliahaving reference to private violence against the guilty party and, under
the terms of the interdict, you, as the former possessor, can compel him to
give you possession, and there is no doubt that he can also be compelled to
surrender the income which he may have obtained from the land.
Ordered at Sirmium, on the sixth of the Idesof April, during the Consulate of
the Csesars.
5. The Emperor Constantine to Tertullians.
Anyone who has seized land is liable to the penalty prescribed by law, provided
he is proved to have been guilty of violence, for, when the possession of
property is obtained by others, either through mistake or the negligence of the
owner, it should be restored without the imposition of a penalty.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Gallicanus and
Symmachus, 330.
6. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Potitus, Prefect of the
City.
All persons are informed that, in every instance where the owners of property
are sued either under a Rescript published by the Emperor, or by virtue of the
decision of any judge, and the parties are absent, notice should be served upon
their agents or attorneys, in order that no occasion for injury may arise from
the source of the law. If the litigants should fail to obey Our orders, they
shall be deprived of all rights to the matter in dispute.
(1) When the curators or guardians of minors, acting in collusion, cause the
said minors to lose their cases, and be deprived not only of the property which
they are entitled to, but of the profits as well, We come to their relief in
order that they may not suffer injury through the culpable rashness of others.
Possession shall at once be restored to him who was deprived of it, and the
curators or guardians shall be punished by perpetual banishment, and their
property confiscated.
Given on the second of the Nonesof April, during the Consulate of Antoninus and
Syagrius, 382.
7. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Mes-sianus, Count of
Private Affairs.
If anyone should be so bold as to forcibly seize property in possession of the
Treasury, or of any persons whomsoever, before a judicial decision has been
rendered, the owner of the same, after having established his right to the
possession of what he took, shall restore it to the possessor, and shall lose
all title to the said property.
If, however, he forcibly took possession of what belonged to another, he shall
not only restore it to the possessor, but shall also be compelled to pay him
the value of said property.
Given on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of
Timasius and Promotus, 389.
8. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Paliphilus.
The interdict of temporary possession, which does not always have reference to
public or private violence, shall be heard at once, and without being reduced
to writing.
Given at Milan, on the sixth of the Idesof June, during the Consulate of
Olybrius and Probinus, 395.
9. The Emperor Zeno to Sebastian, Praetorian Prefect.
If, after the act of violence has been proved in court, the question with
reference to the property removed or seized is taken up, as well as the damage
sustained at the time, and the person who suffered the violence cannot prove
the loss of each individual article, an estimate having been made by the judge
in accordance with the character of the person, and the nature of the
transaction, the plaintiff must establish by his oath the general value of the
property which he lost, but he shall not be permitted to swear to an estimate
higher than that fixed by the judge, and the amount having been stated under
oath in this manner, the court must render judgment accordingly.
Given at Constantinople, on the Idesof December, after the fifth Consulate of
Armatius, 477.
10. The Same Emperor to Sebastian, Praetorian Prefect.
It is not unreasonable for an ancient constitution, as well as the present one,
to declare that those who unlawfully seize the possession of another should be
punished. Hence those who lease or retain possession of property belonging to
others cannot, with impunity, attempt to prevent the lessors of said property
from recovering possession of it according to law, which possession they only
granted them temporarily, when the latter can advance no legal right to the
same, and prefer to offer resistance, and not suffer the owners to recover the
possession to which they are justly entitled, but wait for an order of court.
If the decision should, under such circumstances, be against them, We decree
that, for their impudence and injustice, they shall not only be compelled to
surrender to the successful party possession of the property which they were
unwilling to voluntarily restore to the owner until a final decision had been
rendered, but also to pay him a sum equal to its value.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifth of the Kalendsof April, during the
Consulate of Theoderic and Venantius, 424.
11. The Emperor Justinian to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
When a doubt arose among the members of the Illyrian Bar, as to what course
should be pursued concerning those who, without the
authority of a judicial decree, retained possession of property left vacant
during the absence of the owner, for the reason that the ancient laws did not
provide for the recovery of possession of this kind, either by the interdicts
Unde vior Quod vi out clam,or by any other legal proceeding, violence not
having occurred in taking possession of the property, and as no action was
allowed the owner except the one in rem,We, not permitting anyone to seize the
property or possession of others by his own authority, do hereby order that a
possessor of this kind shall be understood to be a thief, and held liable under
the general provisions set forth in the ancient laws treating of the
restitution of possession against persons of this kind. For it is ridiculous to
say or believe that anyone could, through ignorance, occupy property belonging
to another as his own. All persons should know that what is not theirs must
assuredly belong to someone else, as a provision of this kind was long ago
prescribed by the ancient laws in the action of theft, for they declared that
if anyone should take the property of another without the consent of the owner,
he will be liable in an action of theft; and the laws which have been
promulgated by Us with reference to the recovery of possession shall be
applicable to these cases, if the term of thirty years from the time when
possession was taken has not elapsed.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof November, after the fifth Consulate of
Lampadius and Orestes, 532.
TITLE V.
WHERE THE POSSESSION OF AN ABSENT PERSON is INTERFERED WITH BY FORCE OR IN ANY
OTHER WAY.
1. The Emperor Constantius to Severus.
The judges of absent persons who have been deprived of the possession of
property must admit their legal demands, as well as exert the full force of
their authority to protect them, and diligently inquire whether the possession
of him who is absent for any reason was retained in his behalf, by one of his
neighbors, ascendants, relatives, friends, tenants, freedmen or slaves. Nor
shall the claims of those who have possession in the name of the absent party
be rejected, even if they are slaves, on the ground that they were not
authorized to institute legal proceedings by the owner, although it is not
lawful for persons of this condition to appear in court.
But after the time for recovering possession prescribed by law has elapsed,
temporary possession shall be granted without any delay to the parties bringing
suit, just as if the owner of the property, having returned, was conducting the
case.
We, however, grant the owner the right of action to recover possession, no
matter when he may return, because restitution of possession might, in the
meantime, be deferred on account of the bad faith of slaves, or the negligence
of neighbors, parents, friends, tenants, or freedmen, as the expiration of the
time prescribed by law for the
recovery of possession should not prejudice the rights of those who are absent.
Everything unjustly interfered with having been restored to its former
condition, whatever relates to the discussion of the case shall remain
unaltered, and decision shall be reserved until the appearance of the just and
lawful owners, who are absent, as it is amply sufficient for protection against
acts of violence to be afforded those holding possession of the property in the
name of the absent parties.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of
Constantius, Consul for the seventh time, and the Csesar Constans, Consul for
the third time, 326.
2. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Petronius, Vicegerent of the Spains.
No answer of the Emperor obtained by the petition of a litigant, nor any
interlocutory decree of a judge can, in any manner, change the condition of the
possession so far as an absent person who is entitled to the ownership of the
property is concerned, because the merits of the case must be determined by the
evidence of the parties interested.
Given at Milan, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate
of Caesarius and Atticus, 397.
TITLE VVII..CONCERNING THE INTERDICT UTI POSSIDETIS.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Cyrlllus.
The Governor of the province, by employing the interdict Uti possidetis,will
prevent any violence being done to you because of the land in dispute, provided
you have not obtained possession of the same from another, either by force,
clandestinely, or under a precarious title, and he will examine the question of
ownership after the provisions of the Perpetual Edict with reference to
furnishing security or transferring possession have been complied with.
Given at Nicomedia, on the third of the Idesof October, during the Consulate of
the Caesars.
TITLE VII.
CONCERNING THE PRODUCTION OF WILLS. 1. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus to
Germanus.
If the children under the age of puberty were subject to the control of their
father, and you were substituted for them, and they died before reaching
puberty, the estate will belong to you, and you can avail yourself of the
interdict to compel the production of the will.
Published on the seventh of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of
Secularus and Donatus, 261.
TITLE Vill.
CONCERNING THE PRODUCTION OR INTRODUCTION OF CHILDREN AND FREEMEN IN COURT.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Justin.
If (as you allege) you are your own master, and have obtained a judgment with
reference to the property of the mother's estate, you can sue the persons
against whom a decision was rendered in your favor. If, however, anyone should
appear who asserts that you are his son and under his control, recourse having
been had to the interdict, the truth of his claim shall be investigated.
Published on the sixth of the Idesof April, during the Consulate of the two
Aspers, 213.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Cyrilla.
Go before the Governor of the province and demand that your sons be produced.
Published at Byzantium on the fifth of the Idesof April, during the Consulate
of the above-mentioned Emperors.
3. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Evodia.
If you think that Philip should, by means of an interdict, be compelled to
produce his daughter, the Governor of the province, having been applied to,
will take cognizance of your dispute.
Ordered at Nicomedia, on the twelfth of the Kalendsof December, during the
Consulate of the above-mentioned Emperors.
TITLE IX. CONCERNING THE PRECARIOUS AND SALVIAN INTERDICTS.
1. The Emperor Gordian to Aristo.
If your debtor should, without your releasing the lien, sell property which has
been pledged to you, you will have the right to claim the said property, but
not under the Salvian interdict, for it can only be employed against a lessee
or a debtor; but you must proceed by the Servian Action, or the one which has
been devised in imitation of it, and which should be brought against the
purchaser.
Published on the sixth of the Idesof September, during the Consulate of Pius
and Pontianus, 239.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Fabricius.
It is clearly stated in the interdict to be filed against them that the heirs
of one who had a precarious right of habitation are required to surrender the
house to which the right attaches.
TITLE X. CONCERNING PRIVATE BUILDINGS.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Taurus.
You can (as you desire to do) construct a bath, and place a building above it,
provided, however, that you observe the law enacted with reference to those who
build above a bath; that is to say, you must erect the superstructure as well
as the bath itself upon arches, and do not raise it above the ordinary height.
Without date or designation of Consulate.
2. The Emperor Alexander to Diogenes.
It is forbidden both by an Edict of the Divine Vespasian and a Decree of the
Senate to demolish a building and remove the marble composing it for the
purpose of selling the same, but an exception is made where the marble is to be
transferred from one building to another, as this can be done. Owners, however,
are not permitted to transfer the materials in such a way that, when the
buildings are demolished, the general appearance of the neighborhood will be
rendered less attractive.
Published on the eleventh of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Alexander, 225.
3. The Same Emperor to Evocatus.
The Governor of the province, after proper investigation, and in accordance
with what is frequently done in controversies of this kind which arise in
towns, must decide whether you will be permitted to demolish your entire house,
not for the purpose of rebuilding it in the city, but in order to convert it
into a garden, and whether this can be effected with the consent of a
magistrate and that of your neighbors.
Published on the seventh of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of
Julian, Consul for the second time, and Crispinus, 225.
4. The Emperor Philip and the Csesar Philip to Victor.
If (as you allege) the other joint-owner of the building refuses to pay his
share of the expense incurred for necessary repairs, you will not be obliged to
have recourse to extraordinary proceedings, as you propose to do, for if you
alone have rebuilt the house, and your partner does not pay his share of the
expense with interest at the rate of twelve per cent within the term of four
months, or if it should be proved that he is to blame for not having done so,
you can demand and obtain the ownership of the entire property in accordance
with the provisions of the ancient laws.
Published on the fourth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Philip
and Titian, 346.
5. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Octwvius.
If he against whom you have petitioned, being aware that the part of the land
in question belongs to you, and well knowing that he had
no rights either as a partner of a joint-owner, proceeded to construct a bath
under the assumption of joint-ownership, with the intention of acquiring the
entire property if you did not pay your share of the expense, and also
attempted to rebuild a bath which had been demolished, and as all structures
placed on the land of another belong to the soil, and the expense incurred in
their construction should not be refunded to those who wrongfully erected them,
under the terms of an ancient Edict of the Divine Hadrian, the Governor of the
province, mindful of the public law on this point, shall act as legally
required in the settlement of the controversy.
Published on the sixth of the Nonesof October, during the Consulate of
Diocletian, Consul for the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third
time, 290.
6. The Emperor Constantine to Elpidius, acting as Deputy of the Prsetorian
Prefect.
If anyone, after the promulgation of this law, should remove from the city to
the country any ornaments taken from a house, that is to say, any marble or
columns, he shall be deprived of the building which he decorated in this way.
Where, however, anyone desires to transfer any columns or marble from a house
which is falling into ruin in a city to another house of his own in a different
town, he shall be permitted to do so, as these materials continue to be public
ornaments, remaining as they do in both instances, in cities.
The same authority is also granted to transfer ornaments of this kind to
another place of the same description, even though it may be necessary to
transport them through the middle of a city, or beyond the walls, provided that
those materials which have been taken from one town shall only be used in
another.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof June, during the second Consulate of
Crispus and Constantius, 321.
7. The Emperor Julian to Vitianus, Vicegerent of Africa.

material whatsoever, out of a province.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of Julian,
Consul for the fourth time, and Sallust, 363.
8. The Emperors Valens, Gratian, and Valentinian to Modestus, Prsetorian
Prefect.
The decurions of each city are required, even against their consent, either to
repair houses within cities in which they formerly resided, or to entirely
rebuild them, when this becomes necessary, because they are always obliged to
discharge their duties in the same city in which they live, and should, so far
as they can, contribute to the size of the same.
The possessors of houses, who are not decurions, must repair them if they have
fallen into decay and have been neglected, and the judges shall exert their
authority to enforce observance of this law.1

of a town or city, which was charged with its government, corresponding in

Gratian, Consul for the fourth time, and Nerobaudus, 377.
9. The Emperors Theodosius, Arcadius, and Honorius to JEmili-anus, Prefect of
the City.
Where anyone who owns property in the neighborhood of a public building intends
to erect a house upon it, he must remember when building it to leave the space
of fifteen feet between the two edifices, so that, by means of this space, the
public building will not be endangered, and the private individual will not,
hereafter, run the risk of having his house demolished for having constructed
it in a place where he had no right to do so.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of Arcadius,
Consul for the sixth time, and Probus, 406.
10. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Monaxius, Prie-torian Prefect.
Persons who desire to do so shall be permitted to surround their own lands, or
premises known to belong to them, with a wall, in the provinces of Mesopotamia,
Osdroena, Euphrates, Second Syria, Phoenicia, Libanus, Second Cilicia, both the
provinces of Armenia, both the Provinces of Cappadocia, Polemoniac, Pontus, the
Hellespont, and all other provinces where it may be desirable to do so.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Nonesof May, during the Consulate
of Theodosius, Consul for the eleventh time, and Con-stantius, Consul for the
third time, 421.
11. The Same Emperors to Severinus, Prsetorian Prefect.
Balconies (called in Greek re^osa?),whether they have already been, or may
hereafter be, built in the provinces, shall, without exception, be demolished,
unless they have a space of ten feet between them for the free circulation of
air. Moreover, in places where the buildings of private individuals adjoin
public warehouses, the space of fifteen feet must be left between the
balconies. We have established this interval in the case of buildings so that,
if anyone should attempt to encroach upon the space prescribed, that is to say,
erect a balcony projecting over the distances of ten and fifteen feet above
mentioned, he may know that not only what he built will be demolished, but that
the house will itself be confiscated to Our Treasury.
many respects to the boards of aldermen and municipal councils of the present
day. Originally, the munus,or official responsibility, was only an incident of
the position, or honor,and was not imposed upon the appointee, if unwilling;
but more recent laws practically divested him of any distinction it conferred,
while reserving and enforcing compliance with all the obnoxious features which
characterized the employment, for which the exemptions and privileges
subsequently granted by the emperors to the incumbents did not, in their eyes,
by any means afford adequate compensation. Acceptance of the office was
compulsory, and as it involved the discharge of duties which were always more
or less onerous and disagreeable, it was execrated by the citizens, who availed
themselves of every possible pretext to avoid public service in that
capacity.ED.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of
Asclepiodotus and Marinianus, 423.
12. This Law is not Authentic.
13. The Emperor Justinian to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
As a doubt arose whether the Constitution of the Emperor Zeno, of Divine
Memory, addressed to Amantius, Prefect of the City, and relating to servitudes,
was only local in its effect, and intended to be observed in this most
flourishing City, and whether the ancient laws which conflict with it were
applicable to the provinces, We, thinking that it would be unworthy of Our
reign for one law to be obeyed in this way in this Imperial City, and another
by the inhabitants of Our provinces, do hereby decree that the same
constitution shall prevail in all the cities of the Roman Empire, and that
everything shall be done in accordance with its provisions, and if the ancient
law was, in any way, altered by the present one, the latter shall be observed
by the Governors of the various provinces; in other words, all regulations
which are not changed by the law of Zeno, but are contained in the ancient
enactments, shall everywhere remain in full force.
Given at Constantinople, during the Kalendsof September, after the fifth
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
TITLE XI.
CONCERNING THE NOTICE PROHIBITING THE ERECTION OF A NEW STRUCTURE.
1. The Emperor Justinian to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
We are aware that a doubt arose among the ancients with reference to a notice
not to erect a new structure, and that where one person had warned another not
to proceed with it, he could not again prohibit him from doing so after a year
has elapsed from the time when the notice was served. This appears to Us to be
doubly unjust, for either he did not have good grounds for forbidding him to
erect the building (and if this was the case it was not right that he should
prevent him from doing so for an entire year), or if he did have good cause to
serve the notice, he should be permitted again to forbid its construction after
the expiration of a year.
Therefore We, for the purpose of preventing such injustice, do order that if
anyone should serve a notice of this kind in this Imperial City, the case shall
be brought before the Urban Prefect, and if this is done in any province, the
matter shall be disposed of by the Governor of the same within the term of
three months. If, however, any impediment should arise to prevent the decision
of the case, he who was erecting the building shall be allowed to proceed with
the work, after having furnished security to the Urban Prefect, or the Governor
of the province, that if his building should be ascertained to have been
constructed contrary to law he will demolish, at his own expense, all of it
that he erected after notice was served upon him.
This law is enacted in order that the construction of buildings may not be
prevented by notices which are unreasonable, and at the same time that the
interests of those who have good reason for serving such notices may be
protected.
Given at Constantinople, on the twelfth of the Kalendsof November, after the
fifth Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 532.
TITLE XII. CONCERNING PUBLIC WORKS.
1. The Emperors Constantius and Constans to Catulinus.
Many persons have, through the concessions of judges, obtained exemption from
the construction of public works, and therefore We decree that unlawful
privileges of this description shall, hereafter, be of no force or effect.
Given at Sirmium, on the sixth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of
Ursus, Lupulus and Polemius, 338.
2. The Same Emperors to Marcellinus, Count of the East.
You understand that where expenses have been incurred in the construction of
public works, credit should be given for the same.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifth of the Nonesof October, during the
Consulate of Limenius and Catulinus, 349.
3. This Law is not Authentic.
4. The Same Emperors to Ecdicius, Prefect of Egypt.
Buildings for the use of judges, and public edifices, must always be devoted to
the dispensation of justice, and the use of the people.
Published at Antioch, on the fourth of the Nonesof December, under the
Consulate of Mamertinus and Nevitta, 362.
5. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Symmachus, Prefect of the City.
No judge shall, without Our sanction, erect a new building within the limits of
ancient and modern Rome, unless he wishes to do so at his own expense. We,
however, grant all of them permission to repair any building of which they make
use, if it is shown that it is about to fall into ruin.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof June, under the Consulate of Jovian and
Varonianus, 364.
6. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Proculus.
No prescription of time, nor even the authority of a rescript, shall be pleaded
in favor of what has been done contrary to public law, and therefore all
buildings or other structures, which are known to have been erected in
different cities, either in the Forum or in any other public place, and are
injurious to the ornamentation, convenience, and suitable appearance of the
City, shall be demolished.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Idesof June, during the Consulate
of Merobaudus, Consul for the second time, and Satur-ninus, 383.
7. The Same Emperors to Cynegius, Prsstorian Prefect.
All persons should emulously and in unison assist in the repair or construction
of harbors, aqueducts, and walls; nor shall anyone's rank, no matter what it
may be, exempt him from the performance of this duty.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof February, during the
Consulate of Richomer and Clearchus, 384.
8. The Same Emperors to Cynegius, Prsstorian Prefect.
All those to whom have been committed the construction of public works, where
money for this purpose has been advanced to them in the ordinary way, shall,
with their heirs, be liable for their completion within the term of fifteen
years, so that if any defect of construction should be discovered within the
prescribed time, it may be made good out of their estates, except in cases
which are the result of accident.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Nonesof February, during the
Consulate of Arcadius and Bauto, 385.
9. The Emperors Theodosius, Arcadius, and Honorius to Aurelian, Prefect of the
City.
Your Highness knows that where a grant is made by Us for the construction of
public buildings, the rule must be observed that no house shall be demolished,
under the pretext of the erection of a building, whose value is estimated at
more than fifty pounds of silver; and where the houses are worth more than that
sum, We must be applied to, and the Imperial authority exerted, if a
larger'amount is demanded.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Kalendsof March, during the
Consulate of Theodosius, Consul for the third time, and Abundantius, 393.
10. The Same Emperors to Rufinus, Praetorian Prefect.
Judges shall be considered guilty of high treason who cause their names to be
inscribed upon buildings erected at the public expense, without mentioning that
of the Emperor.
Given on the third of the Nonesof July, during the Consulate of Arcadius,
Consul for the third time, and Honorius, Consul for the second time, 394.
11. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Eusebius, Count of the Sacred
Largesses.
In order that Our magnificent cities and towns may not become ruined through
the effect of age, We hereby set aside the third part of the income from the
public lands for the repair of public buildings and baths.
Given at Milan, on the eleventh of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of
Olybrius and Probinus, 395.
12. The Same Emperors to Csesarius, Praetorian Prefect.
All Governors of provinces are hereby notified that the inhabitants of cities,
without distinction of rank, are obliged to contribute to the construction of
new city walls, or the repair of the old ones, and that the expense of the same
must be distributed so that the allotment of each will be in accordance with
his means, and the real property of the citizens be taxed in proportion to the
estimate of the structure to be erected, so that no more may be demanded than
necessity requires, and no less, for fear construction may be prevented.
This tax must also be equally imposed upon lands which yield a revenue, and
everyone shall be compelled to pay his share of the expense, and no excuse
shall be accepted, and no immunity from contribution granted under any pretext
whatsoever.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate 6f Arcadius,
Consul for the fourth time, and Honorius, Consul for the third time, 396.
13. The Same Emperors to Theodore, Praetorian Prefect.
No judge shall be so rash as to presume to erect a new building without Our
authority, or remove from different edifices any ornaments, marbles, or other
materials which are proved to have been for the use and adornment of the City,
and transport them somewhere else without the order of Your Highness, for if
anyone should do so in violation of this law, he shall be fined six pounds of
gold.
Municipal magistrates shall be liable to the same sentence if, relying upon
this Decree, they do not protect the ornaments of their birthplace. Judges,
however, can, by their own authority, erect warehouses or stables by way of
manifesting their laudable devotion to Us.
Given at Milan, on the third of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Honorius, Consul for the fourth time, and Eutychi-anus, 398.
14. The Same Emperors to Severus, Prefect of the City.
We order that the buildings commonly called parapetasia,1or others which are
attached to the walls of cities, or to public buildings, and on account of
whose condition the neighborhood is threatened with fire or some other danger,
or which occupy the space of public squares, or interfere with the porticos of
public edifices, shall be demolished and destroyed.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifth of the Idesof October, during the
Consulate of Honorius, Consul for the fourth time, and Eutychi-anus, 398.
15. The Same Emperors to Eutychiamts, Praetorian Prefect.
If, at any time, certain men should appear and request Us to grant them the use
of a public building, and a rescript is granted to that effect, they shall not
be allowed the use of said building unless it is
1 That is, "resembling a screen," a Greek term applicable to a building which
obstructs the light, or interferes with the approach to another.ED.
ruinate, almost destroyed, and of very little value to the city, after the
rescript has been presented to Your Highness and you have ascertained that this
is the fact.
Given on the Idesof December, during the Consulate of Honorius, Consul for the
fourth time, and Eutychianus, 398.
16. The Same Emperors to JEmilianus, Prsetorian Prefect.
When, either on account of age, or because of some accident, necessity demands

permitted, even without consulting the Emperor, to remove with all due
reverence either his statue or those of former sovereigns, provided that, after
the building has been repaired, they are returned to their proper places.

Consulate of Arcadius, Consul for the sixth time, and Probus, 406.
17. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Monaxius, Prae-torian Prefect.
Any place within the precincts of Our palace, in this city, which is occupied
by private buildings to the inconvenience of the former, shall be immediately
demolished, as it is not proper for the palace to be confined by the walls of
private residences, for the home of the Emperor should be separate from those
of all other persons; and they alone shall have the right to live .near the
palace who have lawfully been granted this privilege by the Emperor, or who are
required to do so by their public duties; and, for the future, all persons are
hereby prohibited from any encroachment of this description.
Given at Constantinople, on the ninth of the Kalendsof March, during the
Consulate of Honorius, Consul for the eighth time, and Theodosius, Consul for

18. The Same Emperors to Anthemius, Prsetorian Prefect.
We order that the towers of the new wall, which was built for the protection of
this magnificent City, shall, after the work has been completed, be set apart
for the use of those on whose land the said wall has been erected by your care
and foresight, and with Our consent. This privilege is granted to them forever
by the terms of this law, but under the condition that every year those who
have surrendered their rights to said land shall make the necessary repairs at
their own expense, and while they enjoy the use and benefit of public property,
they must not forget that the care and responsibility for said repairs are part
of their duty. In this manner the splendor of the work and the defence of the
city will be connected with the utility and advantage of private individuals,
and both will be preserved.
Given on the second of the Nonesof April, during the Consulate of Lucius, 413.
19. The Same Emperors to Severinus, Prsetorian Prefect.
For the reason that several houses, with their workshops, are said to have been
erected in the porticos of Zeuxippus, We order that,
without any exception, the rents of the aforesaid buildings shall be
appropriated proportionally for the construction of new windows, as well as for
the repair of the roofs, and the maintenance of the baths of this Imperial
City.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof January, during the Consulate of Victor, 424.
20. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Cyrus, Prefect of the City.
We order those persons who, without the authority of an Imperial Rescript
communicated to them by Your Highness, have included entire ends of streets or
portions of the same in their houses, or have appropriated porticos, to return
to the public use of the city what they have in this way taken for their own
use, and if anyone should hereafter be guilty of such audacity, he shall be
liable to a fine of fifty pounds of gold.
Given on the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of Theodosius, Consul for
the seventeenth time, and Festus, 439.
21. The Same Emperors to Cyrus, Prsetorian Prefect.
We order that the Basilica, which has been embellished with gold and marble,
shall remain intact for all time, and that its ornamentation shall not be
obscured by the introduction of the statue of anyone, nor by paintings placed
there in anyone's honor; and We decree that, in no part of said Basilica, shall
any assembly be held, or any banquet be given; and We also decree that no one
shall be permitted to introduce horses, or celebrate marriages therein.

Consulate of Valentinian, Consul for the fifth time, and Anatolius, 440.
22. The Emperor Leo to Erythrius.
No judge shall be allowed to construct a new building either in this renowned
City, or in any of the provinces, before those which one or more of his
predecessors may have left unfinished, or which have been demolished on account
of age, or abandoned through neglect, have been completed by his diligence and
industry, for just as much distinction is acquired by repairing buildings which
are old, and require to be rebuilt, and in finishing those which have been
begun by others but left imperfect, as in erecting new ones.
Given at Constantinople, on the second of the Kalendsof March, during the
Consulate of Martian and Zeno, 448.
TITLE XIII.
CONCERNING THE CONTRACTORS OF PUBLIC WORKS AND THE SENATORS OP CITIES.
1. The Emperor Zeno to Arcadius, Prsstorian Prefect.We order that the Governors
of provinces and the illustrious judges of different districts, that is to say,
the Augustal Prefect, the Count
of the East, and all Proconsuls and Vicegerents, together with those composing
their retinues shall, in conformity with the tenor of the general regulations
established by Your Highness, refrain from interfering with any public works or
aqueducts which either have been constructed at the public expense, or by the
voluntary munificence of anyone, or which may hereafter be constructed; nor
shall they, in any way or at any time, claim for themselves a single siliquaof
the solidiout of the amount to be expended in handling the public revenues,
whether the work has been completed or is to be undertaken hereafter; nor shall
they acquire for themselves any gain, for they have no concern in matters of
this kind, as the municipal bodies are charged with them when they are placed
under their supervision.
Any persons, however, who promise to erect a public building at their own
expense, shall not be required by law to do the work, even though it was
certain that it depended upon a promise or a contract alone; and We decree that
their heirs shall not, in any way, or at any time, be subjected to annoyance,
or be compelled to render an account of the work performed, or that any
controversy shall be raised on the ground that the entire amount of money
promised has not been expended on the work, or that it was done in such a way
as to be useless, or under any other pretext whatsoever.
If the illustrious Governor of the province or his subordinates should, in
opposition to what has been prescribed, violate the provisions of this Our most
sacred law by interfering with the expenditure of the public revenues on any
public work, or by claiming a single siliquaor any other sum whatsoever out of
the said revenues, or on account of the works above mentioned, the five
principal officers of his retinue shall be condemned to perpetual exile, and
their property shall be confiscated to the city which they have injured, and
the Governor of the province himself shall be fined fifty pounds of gold. The
distinguished judges, also (even though they may have been decorated with the
highest honors), as well as their subordinates (as above stated), shall be
liable to the same penalties.
TITLE XIV. CONCERNING PLEDGES AND HYPOTHECATIONS.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Timothy.
A debtor who alleges that he has transferred to his creditors the property
which he pledged to them is by no means released from liability.
Published on the fifth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Severus,
Consul for the second time, and Albinus, 195.
2. The Same Emperors to Lucius.
Although it is established that your adversary received certain property
specially, by way of pledge, and that the remainder has been pledged to him in
general terms and hence he has an equal right to
all of it, the strictness of the rule should, nevertheless, be relaxed.
Therefore, if it is certain that he can collect the entire debt from the sale
of the property which was specifically pledged to him, the Governor of the
province will order that you shall not be deprived of that portion of the same
property which was subsequently encumbered.
Published on the second of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of Chilo
and Libo, 205.
3. The Same Emperors to Maximus.
Creditors, who have made an agreement with their debtors that if the money due
is not paid to them at the designated time they may take possession of their

Geta, 206.
4. The Same Emperors to Bellius.
As you acknowledge that you have received the money and hypothecated your

prescription.

if, after having been notified, they do not pay the debt, you can have recourse

the province will not hesitate to afford you his assistance by means of the
actions to which you are entitled.

If your deceased wife, having borrowed money, pledged her own property, and you
became her heir, although it may not have been provided by the instrument

Ordered on the fifth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors.
13. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Matrona.As you state in your petition that

the above-mentioned Emperors.
14. The Same Emperors and Ciesars to Apianus.

this.
15. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Basilida.
It is certain that a debtor cannot prejudice the rights of a creditor by either
selling, donating, bequeathing, or leaving under a trust the property pledged,

right to the same.

the above-mentioned Emperors.

article pledged.

the above-mentioned Emperors.
17. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Pontia.
Even though your brother purchased land with the money which you lent him,
still, if he did not hypothecate the said land to you either specifically or in
general terms, the payment of your money is not secured by the pledge of the
land, but you will not be prevented from bringing a personal action before the
Governor of the province to collect the debt.

above-mentioned Emperors.

Ordered at Sirmium, on the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.

property, and is responsible for both fraud and negligence.

above-mentioned Emperors.
20. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Alexander.

to return the property
pledged.

Csesars.
22. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Antiochianus.

Consulate of the Caesars.
23. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Macedonianus.
Anyone over twenty-five years of age cannot claim pledges the right to which he

law which considers his intention, will prevent him from doing so.
Ordered at Nicomedia, on the eighteenth of the Kalendsof January, under the
Consulate of the Csesars.
24. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Marcus.
A creditor cannot be compelled to bring a personal action against his debtors
if he has neglected to bring one of pledge.
Ordered at Nicomedia, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the
Consulate of the Csesars.
Extract from Novel 4, Chapter II. Latin Text.
This rule applies where the debtor is in possession of the property encumbered,
but if another is in possession of it, the hypothecary
action cannot be brought until the principal and his surety have been sued in
the personal action. If the debt is not satisfied out of the property
hypothecated by the debtor, then recourse can be had to that hypothecated by
the surety, if there is any. This rule is also applicable to heirs.

Signed at Sirmium, on the fourth of the Kalendsof January, under the Consulate
of the Caesars.
27. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Prsetorian Prefect.
We, for the purpose of permanently remedying all the abuses which have arisen
with reference to the hypothecation of property, which money-brokers, bankers,
or business men of every other description practice against those who lend them
money, do hereby order that if, having made a contract of this kind, they
should acquire for their children, or for any of their relatives some office
which can be sold, or transmitted to heirs under certain conditions, even if it
is not established that the money by which the children were benefited came
from the said creditors, or that the relatives obtained the office purchased
(for it is sufficient that the contrary should not be proved, namely, that
others have furnished the money out of their own estates), the creditors shall
have the right to collect the entire debt from those who have possession of the
said office, or to exact from them as much as the office can be sold for.
We order that this rule shall apply, even if it is proved that the said
merchants obtained the offices for strangers by the payment of their creditor's
money, so that as, generally speaking, debtors themselves are permitted to sell
the offices or transmit them to their heirs, creditors also, who can claim the
offices aforesaid by the right of hypothecation, shall be allowed to sell them,
even during the lifetime of the debtors, unless their debts are paid; and after
their death they can collect from the incumbents of the offices the payment of
their claims according to the average value of the same, or the appraisement
made when they were bestowed by the Emperor.
This rule shall be observed for the protection of creditors as against
merchants personally, although those who hold the offices may, under no
circumstances, be liable for the indebtedness. We order that this law shall in
the future apply to offices obtained not only when bankers or merchants have
acquired them for their children or other relatives,
but also for strangers, by the payment of money belonging to their
creditors.
Given on the Kalendsof June, during the Second Consulate of Our
Lord the Emperor Justinian, 526.
Extract from Novel 53, Chapter V. Latin Text.
This rule only applies where the money has been borrowed for the purpose of
purchasing the office; otherwise, the children or wife of the deceased shall be
preferred to other creditors. If, however, there should be none of these, then
We grant this privilege to the creditors.
TITLE XV.
CONCERNING CASES IN WHICH PROPERTY is TACITLY PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Speratus.
The entire property of those who are liable to the payment of taxes is
encumbered by pledge to secure the collection of the same.
2. The Same Emperor to Proculus.
It is certain that the property of him who makes a contract with the Treasury
is encumbered, as by a pledge, although this may not have been expressly
provided.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Messala and
Sabinus, 215.
3. Extract from a Rescript of the Emperor Alexander Addressed to Demosthenes.
Although the income of land given in pledge (even where this has not been
explicitly stated) is, by tacit agreement, included in the property encumbered,
still, land which has been purchased with the proceeds of the crops is
considered by no jurist to be embraced in this
category.
Published during the Idesof October, during the Consulate of Maximus, Consul
for the second time, and JElianus, 224.
4. The Emperor Carus, Carinus, and Numerianus to Africanus.
It is well enough known, and sufficiently based upon reason, that property
given by way of dowry to women who marry Chief Centurions of the Triarii is
liable for the indebtedness incurred during the administration of the latter.
This, however, is true with certain restrictions, as the woman does not become
liable, except where the entire property of the Centurion and of those who
appointed him, having been exhausted, nothing is found to remain.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof August, during the Consulate of Carus and
Carinus, 285.
5. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximum, and the Csesars, to Corinthia.
If it is shown that the slaves in question were not transferred with the
property which it was decided was encumbered, and that they were not specially
pledged for the payment of the debt, the Governor of the province will order
them to be returned. Nor can their restitution be delayed under the pretext
that rent is due, since, if the woman who was the owner of the property can
prove that there is anything due to her as rent, or for any other reason, it is
proper for her to exact payment by law.
Ordered on the twelfth of the Kalends ofFebruary, during the Consulate of the
Cassars.
6. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Florentius, Prze-torian Prefect.
When a mother who has obtained the legal guardianship of her children contracts
a second marriage in violation of the oath which she took before causing
another guardian to be appointed for them, she shall pay to the said children
what is due to them under her administration of the guardianship, and the
property of her deceased husband, as well as her own, will be considered as
pledged for the discharge of any indebtedness contracted by her during her
administration of the guardianship.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof . . . , during the Consulate of Theodosius,
Consul for the seventeenth time, and Festus, 409.
7. The Emperor Justinian to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
We order that the property brought into a house by a tenant shall be tacitly
pledged to the owner for the rent, and this law shall apply not only to ancient
and modern Rome and their territory, but also to the provinces of Our Empire,
for We desire that all the inhabitants shall have the benefit of this equitable
presumption.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof November, after the fifth Consulate of
Lampadius and Orestes, 532.
TITLE XVI.
WHERE PROPERTY BELONGING TO ANOTHER is PLEDGED. 1. The Emperors Severus and
Antoninus to Carpus.
The agent did not lawfully pledge the house of his principal without the
consent of the latter. If, however, it is established that he employed the
money of the creditor for the benefit of the property of his principal, an
exception can be pleaded, if the former desires what has been loaned to be
collected.
Published on the eleventh of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of
Severus, Consul for the second time, and Albinus, 195.
2. The Same Emperors to Latina.
If you prove before the Governor of the province that the fields or gardens in
dispute are yours, you understand that they cannot be hypothecated to a
creditor by another person, even though this was done without your knowledge,
unless you concealed your title to said property for the purpose of defrauding
the creditor.
Published on the first of the Idesof October, during the second Consulate of
Antoninus and Geta, 206.
3. The Emperors Antoninus to Martia.
Neither the curator of an adult, nor the guardian of a minor, can legally
pledge the movable property of him whose affairs he administers, unless he
borrows money on what is pledged.
Published on the fifth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of the
two Aspers, 213.
4. The Emperor Alexander to Secundus.
Even if your son was more than twenty-five years of age, if he was still under
your control he could not hypothecate any of your property against your
consent.
Published on the fifth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of
Maximus, Consul for the second time, and Julianus, 224.
5. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Eutichius.
As property which did not yet belong to the debtor was pledged by him, and
afterwards became his own, it is clear that an ordinary action on pledge will
not lie, but equity requires that a praetorian action resembling that of pledge
should be granted.
Published on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of
Maximus, Consul for the second time, and Aquilinus, 286.
6. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Zosimus.
She who gave in pledge to her creditor land which she had already transferred
as a donation to her children has rendered herself liable to the counteraction
of pledge, and could not injure the owners in any respect, as the Servian
Action plainly shows that property cannot be held by the right of pledge unless
it belongs to the person incurring the obligation, and it is also perfectly
certain that the property ol another cannot be encumbered by anyone against the
consent of the owner.
Ordered at Philippopolis, on the fifth of the Idesof July, during the Consulate
of the above-mentioned Emperors.
7. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Cornelia.
If your guardian gave your slave in pledge to secure the payment of borrowed
money employed for his own use, and, after you attained your majority, you did
not give your consent to the transaction, the property will not be encumbered
as a pledge.

above-mentioned Emperors.
8. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
Land cannot be encumbered except by someone who has the legal right to do so.

stated that no lien can, without the knowledge or consent of the owner, be
placed upon such property by a slave, an agent, a tenant, a steward, or a
lessee.
Given at Ravenna, on the Idesof July, during the Consulate of Honorius, Consul
for the thirteenth time, and Theodosius, Consul for the tenth time, 422.
TITLE XVII.
WHAT PROPERTY WHEN PLEDGED CAN OR CANNOT BE
RENDERED LIABLE FOR A DEBT, AND IN WHAT WAY A
PLEDGE is GIVEN.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Optatus.
It is not reasonable to suppose that your children by a concubine, and other
effects which usually are only pledged under a special agreement, constitute
part of property encumbered by a general contract including your possessions.
Published on the twelfth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of
Lateranus and Rufinus, 198.
2. The Same Emperors to Rogatus.
As it is settled that the obligation of pledge is created by consent, We
entertain no doubt that he who pledged the agreements for the purchase of his
lands intended to hypothecate the lands themselves.
Published on the fifth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Aper and
Maximus, 208.
3. The Emperor Antoninus to Restitutus.
If you have placed the body of your daughter in a tomb, you have made the tomb

encumbered by anyone, as the laws concerning religion forbid it.
Published on the third of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Lsetus,
Consul for the second time, and Cerealis, 216.
4. The Emperor Alexander to Evocatus.
It was long since decided that the claim of a debtor can be pledged either
generally or specifically. Therefore, if the debtor to whom you lent the money
should not discharge his obligation, he whose claim was given to you by way of
pledge can be compelled by equitable actions, unless he pays the person whom he
himself owes, and security
has not been furnished for the settlement of your obligation, to pay you the
amount that you can prove is due to you from his creditor, to the extent that
he himself is indebted.
Published on the day before the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of
Fuscus, Consul for the second time, and Dexter, 226.
5. The Same Emperor to Septimius.
To pledge, by a private agreement, the prizes to be obtained in an athletic
contest is, under no circumstances, allowed, and therefore they are not
considered included even if a general contract for the pledge of all property
should be made.
Published on the third of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and Paternus, 234.
6. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Rufus.
Anyone who received either your children or persons who are free, by way of
pledge for the money which he lent you, deceives himself in attempting to evade
the law, as it is clear that the obligation of pledge was not contracted,
except with reference to such property as the debtor could legally encumber.
Ordered at Heraclia, on the Kalendsof May, under the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors*
7. The Emperor Constantine to all the Inhabitants of the Provinces.
We order that the officers appointed by any judge for the collection of debts
which are the subject of a civil action shall not remove from the possession of
others any slaves, oxen, or implements used for the cultivation of the soil, on
the ground that they have been pledged, by which act the payment of taxes may
be delayed. Therefore, if any agent, creditor, prefect of a district or
village, or decurion, should be convicted of having done this, he shall be
subjected by a penalty to be determined by the judge.
Given at Sirmium, on the third of the Nonesof June, during the Consulate of
Constantine and Licinius, 312.
8. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Probus, Count of the Imperial

Constantius, 414.
Constitution of Frederick.
Agricultural laborers, who are occupied in rustic pursuits, whether they reside
on farms or merely cultivate the land, shall be secure in every part of Our
Empire, so that no one can be found so audacious as to presume to seize, take,
or carry away either their persons, their oxen, their tools, or anything else
used for the tillage of the soil.
If, however, anyone should rashly presume to violate this decree, he shall
restore fourfold the amount of what he carried away, and shall be branded with
infamy by the law, in addition to being punished with the displeasure of the
Emperor.
9. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Prsetorian Prefect.
If anyone should insert the following words into the instrument evidencing a
contract, namely, "For the liability, and at the risk of the property which
belongs to me," or "I promise to pay you at the risk of my property," We decree
that these words shall be sufficient for the hypothecation of any property
which the debtor has at the time, or may thereafter acquire, notwithstanding
that the terms of former laws do not seem to apply to special hypothecation, as
it is just rather to consider the intention of the contracting parties than the
meaning of their words.
With reference to general hypothecations, and for the purpose of carrying out
the wishes of the contracting parties, We decree that even if the debtor should
not, when he encumbers his property, add, "The property which I have at
present, as well as that which I may acquire in the future," the general right
of hypothecation will include anything that he may subsequently obtain.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Idesof December, during the
Consulate of Our Lord the Emperor Justinian, Consul for the second time, 538.
TITLE XVIII.
WHO ARE PREFERRED CREDITORS WHEN PROPERTY is PLEDGED.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Secundus.
Anyone who receives property in pledge which has already been encumbered in
this way can confirm his right by paying the prior creditor the money which is
due to him; or, if he should tender it, and the other should refuse to accept
it, he must seal it up, and deposit it, and not convert it to his own use.
Published on the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of Lateranus and
Rufinus, 198.
2. The Emperor Antoninus to Chrestus and Others.
If you were placed in possession of land belonging to an estate for the purpose
of preserving the same, under a decree of the Praetor, who rendered a decision
with reference to the trust before your adversary obtained the said land
through hypothecation, by virtue of a judgment, you become preferred creditors
by the decree of the Praetor who gave the decision in your favor; and where
several parties claim the property because of a pledge, he who is first in
order shall be preferred by law.
Published on the fifth of the Idesof May, during the Consulate of the two
Aspers, 213.
3. The Same Emperor to Varus.
If you receive a tract of land in pledge before it was encumbered to the State,
as you were first in time, so you will be preferred by law.
Published on the fifth of the Idesof October, during the Consulate of
Antoninus, Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 213.
4. The Same Emperor to Sylvanus.
As you allege that the municipality of the Heliopolitans has, under the terms
of the decree, been placed in possession not only of the private property of
the heir but also of that belonging to the estate, you understand that although
your father made a contract with Sosianus, still, if the city had the right to
bring a personal action against him, it should be preferred under the law of
pledge, so far as any property which it seized to protect a judgment rendered
by a magistrate is concerned.
Published on the second of the Idesof December, during the Consulate of Lsetus,
Consul for the second time, and Cerealis, 216.
5. The Emperor Alexander to Septimius.
The prior creditor cannot be compelled to discharge your debt, as you took a
pledge on the property after he did, but if you pay him all that is due to him,
you will have the exclusive right to the pledge.
Published on the third of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and Paternus, 234.
6. The Same Emperors Valerian and Gallienus to Philoxenus.
When property is encumbered in general terms and is afterwards specifically
pledged to another, as the creditor who made the first contract has the prior
lien by virtue of the general obligation, if you purchased the property before
the second pledge was given, you cannot be molested by him who made the
subsequent loan.
Published on the second of the Idesof May, during the Consulate of Secularis,
Consul for the second time, and Donatus, 261.
7. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Julianus.
Although the same pledges may have been given to several creditors at different
times, and those who are first in point of time are entitled to the preference,
still, he who proves that the land in question was purchased with his money is
declared by the law to be preferred to all others, for the reason that it is
settled that the land was especially encumbered to him by the pledge.
Published on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of
the above-mentioned Emperors.
Extract from Novel 18, Chapter X. Latin Text.
Likewise, the possessor of a pledge who denies that the property belongs to him
whom his adversary alleges is the owner, and this
having been proved, claims the right to retain the property, stating that he
should be preferred to the party who brought the suit on the ground of
hypothecation, or for some other reason, he must surrender possession before an
investigation of his right can take place.
8. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Fabricius.
It is a clear and positive rule of law that where the same property has been
pledged at different times to two different persons, he who first received the
pledge for the money lent shall be preferred, and that the second creditor
cannot obtain authority to sell the pledge before the amount due to the prior
creditor has been paid.
Ordered at Heraclia, on the day before the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate
of the above-mentioned Emperors.
9. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Asclepiodotiis.
As those who have received pledges are entitled to a real action, it is
established that they should be preferred to all those in whose favor personal
actions will lie.
Given on the third of the Nonesof December, during the Consulate of the
Csesars, 293.
10. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Pollipeuca.
As your husband encumbered the property which he received from you as dowry,
and then died, those to whom he pledged it can, under no circumstances, assert
their claims before tendering the amount which is due, for it is clear that
creditors whose obligations have been reduced to writing cannot bring either
real or personal actions against those who are not proved to have succeeded the
debtor.
Published on the Nonesof December, during the Consulate of the Caesars, 293.
11. The Emperor Leo to Erythrius, Praetorian Prefect.
We order that those written instruments which are often secretly made by
certain persons, in the presence of their friends, for the purpose of sale,
compromise, contract, the loan of money at interest, partnership, or for any
other reason, and any other agreements whatsoever, called in Greek iSiox«pa,
whether they were entirely written by the hands of the contracting parties or
have been drawn up by a notary or any other person whomsoever, whether they
bear the signatures of the contracting parties or not, or whether witnesses
were called to attest them or not, or whether they are conditional or not, that
is, such as are commonly reduced to writing, they shall be considered as having
been publicly executed; and if any personal action based on them should be
brought, it shall have full force and effect.
(1) If, however, anyone should claim for himself the right of pledge or
hypothecation, by virtue of any instrument of this description, We order that
he who founds his demand upon a document publicly executed shall be preferred,
even if he comes after another in point of time, unless the privately executed
instrument of the prior
creditor bears the signature of three witnesses, all of approved and .honorable
reputation, for, in this instance, the document shall be considered to have
been publicly executed.
Given on the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Martianus and Zeno, 469.
Extract from Novel 73, Chapters I and II. Latin Text.
Where anyone prudently desires to deposit a sum of money with another, he
should not solely rely upon the written receipt of the person who receives it,
but should summon not less than three competent witnesses who are worthy of
confidence.
But if anyone should draw up an instrument evidencing a loan or any other
contract whatsoever, and not wish the transaction to become publicly known, the
instrument executed with reference to the loan shall not, of itself, be worthy
of faith, unless this was done in the presence of three trustworthy witnesses,
whether they appeared and attached their own signatures to the instrument, or
whether others testify that it was signed in their presence; for then, in
either instance, it shall be considered as publicly executed and valid. If,
however, anyone who either deposits or lends money, or makes any other kind of
a contract, is satisfied with the signature of the individual with whom he
makes it, he is hereby notified that a mere written statement of this
description is not sufficient for the proof of the same.
, 12. The Emperor Justinian to John, Praetorian Prefect.
We are continually annoyed by the persistent applications of women who complain
that they have lost their dowries, for the reason that the property of their
husbands has been seized by creditors whose claims are prior to their own.
Hence, We have examined the ancient laws, and, with reference to personal
actions, find that the Actio rei uxorisewhich We have abolished was granted by
them to the wife, and that they conferred the great privilege of precedence
over all other personal actions, as well as over other creditors, even though
the claims of the latter were prior in point of time. And, while this related
to personal actions, when these laws came to discuss the hypothecary action,
they at once relax the severity of justice, and exclude the recent
hypothecations of women, if they had any rights of action, in favor of
creditors who held prior ones, without having any regard to the weakness of the
sex, and that husbands made use of their bodies, property, and all their lives,
since almost the entire fortune of a woman is included in her dowry.
It was proper to decree that husbands should satisfy their creditors out of
their own property, and not out of the dowries of their wives, as a woman
possesses the dowry for the purpose of her subsistence, whether it was given by
herself, or by someone else for her benefit.
(1) After having carefully examined and considered all these matters, as well
as the other two Constitutions which We have promulgated concerning dowries,
We, for the purpose of coming to the relief of women, and to consolidate all
these rules into one, do hereby
decree an action on the ground of stipulation which We have already granted to
women with reference to their dowries, and in favor of whom We have permitted a
tacit hypothecation on the property of their husbands, as well as the
preference over all other creditors of the former, even though the said
creditors may enjoy the advantage of priority of time. For, as the Actio rei
uxorissenjoyed this privilege in case of personal actions (as We have already
stated) for this reason, We now grant the wife this advantage, even where no
hypothecation has taken place, although the dotal property, or any other which
has been purchased with it, may not be in existence, or has been wasted or
consumed in some way or other, provided it was actually given to the husband.
For who does not pity those who have had to bury their husbands, and who may
incur the risk of childbirth and the rearing of their children, on account of
which things many privileges have been bestowed by Our laws?
Therefore, what the ancients began but did not carry to completion We have
fully consummated; and We grant this privilege to a woman, whether she has
children, did not have them in the first place, or has lost them. Children born
of a former marriage are, however, excepted, and are preferred to their
stepmothers, and We grant them a tacit hypothecation against the estate of
their father, as well as against his creditors on account of their mother's
dowry, and We confer the same privilege upon them by the present law, so that
what was conceded to the second wife may not be refused to the first, but the
rights of both remain unimpaired, just as if the mother of the children were
still living. Where two dowries are due from the same estate, We desire that
the one which is first in point of time shall be preferred to the other.
(2) We order that these rules shall only apply to a dowry, and not to an ante-
nuptial donation, which We decree shall preserve its order of priority, and be
in this way regulated among creditors, for We do not favor women for the sake
of gain, but only take care that they shall suffer no loss, and be defrauded of
their property.
(3) We decree that this law shall only take effect from the present time and
shall not be retroactive.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifth of the Kalendsof December, after the
fifth Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
Extract from Novel 96, Chapter II. Latin Text.
A woman can avail herself of this right against those who are protected by a
personal privilege, as, for instance, where property is purchased, or repairs
are made with her money, except those who are exempted by a new constitution,
for example wives who have lent their husbands money under a written contract
for the purchase of an office.
Extract from Novel 93, Chapter I. Latin Text.
When any of the property composing the dowry is in existence, it shall be
preserved for the wife, who is entitled to an action in rem,
or for her children; and, on the other hand, if there are two wives, and both
are living, or both are dead, or if only one of them survives, the first one,
or her offspring, shall be entitled to the preference, which is clearly
provided for by a new constitution.
TITLE XIX.
CONCERNING THOSE WHO SUCCEED TO THE PLACES OF PRIOR CREDITORS.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Marcellina.
Those who satisfy the creditor of another, whose debt is secured by
hypothecation, do not, merely by the payment of money, take his place; for, in
order that this may be done, he who subsequently discharges the obligation must
do so under the agreement that the same property will be pledged to him, and
that he will succeed to the rights of the creditor. As this was not done by you
(for it has been decided in court that you did not receive the pledges) it is
useless for you to think that you are entitled to the benefit of Our
Constitution which has reference to cases of this kind.
Published on the Idesof July, during the Consulate of Pompeianus and Abvitus,
210.
2. The Emperor Antoninus to Felix.
As you paid money to the Treasury for your father, at a time when you were not
under his.control, and by so doing have succeeded to the rights of the
Treasury, and have taken the place of the creditor to whom you have the money,
your father's creditors, not only those in favor of whom a personal action will
lie, but also those who afterwards made a contract with him secured by pledges,
cannot prejudice your rights in any way by selling the pledges without your
knowledge.
Therefore you understand that if anything was paid by your agents in your name,
during your absence, this should be returned to you as money which was not due,
and you can institute proceedings to recover the pledges to which you are
entitled.
Published at Rome, on the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of Sabinus,
Consul for the second time, and Anulinus, 217.
3. The Emperor Alexander to Valens.
If the preferred creditors, in whose favor the possession of the property was
encumbered, which property you say you purchased with the understanding that
the price would come into their hands, have been paid with your money, you will
succeed to their rights, and you have a good defence against those whose claims
are of more recent date than theirs.
Published on the Kalends ofFebruary, during the Consulate of Julian, Consul for
the second time, and Crispinus, 225.
4. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Carpophorus.
If the State has the prior lien upon the land, you, as the creditor second in
point of time, by tendering the money due will succeed to the rights of the
State.
Published on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of
Maximus, Consul for the second time, and Aquilinus, 285.
TITLE XX. WHERE A PRIOR CREDITOR SELLS THE PROPERTY PLEDGED.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Athenio.
If the creditor who first received the pledge should sell it, you will not be
entitled to the hypothecary action for its recovery; but if the debtor gave the
said pledge to the prior creditor in payment of the debt, or sold it to him,
you will not be deprived of the right to recover it any more than if he had
sold it to a third party.
You understand that you can only assert your right to the encumbered property
if you tender to the person who holds possession of the same what is due to him
under the terms of a contract which was made before yours.
Published on the Idesof May, during the Consulate of Agricola and Clementinus,
231.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Eudemia.
Where property has been pledged according to law, and the creditor makes a
legitimate sale of the same, the debtor by afterwards offering to refund the
price to the purchaser, or by tendering the amount of the debt to the creditor,
cannot evict the possessor of the property.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of the Caesars.
3. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Theophilus.
If the second creditor does not tender the amount of the debt to the first, he
cannot prevent him from selling the property pledged.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of the Csesars.
TITLE XXI. WHERE PROPERTY OWNED IN COMMON is PLEDGED.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Venustus.
As your brother could not encumber the share of the property which belongs to
you, without your consent, so, by giving an obligation, he has only
hypothecated his own share to the creditor, therefore you understand that his
contract can, in no way, prejudice your ownership.
Adopted on the third of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of Messala
and Sabinus, 215.
TITLE XXII.
CONCERNING THE PRAETORIAN PLEDGE AND ITS APPLICATION EVEN TO THE ACTIONS OF
DEBTORS.
1. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Prsetorian Prefect.
If any judges should be of the opinion that the right of praetorian pledge
should be granted to someone, not only with reference to movable or immovable
property, and such as is capable of moving itself, but also with regard to
actions to which the debtor is entitled, We decree that they shall render
judgment permitting this to be
done.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof April, during the fifth
Consulate of Decius, 529.
2. The Same Emperor to Julian, Praetorian Prefect.
With the intention of disposing of the doubts raised under the ancient laws, We
have considered the two kinds of hypothecation, one arising from the contracts
and agreements of men, and the other sanctioned by judges, and designated
praetorian. And, as We have found in agreements made with reference to pledges
or hypothecations that relief is not only ordinarily granted to the creditor in
possession, but also, when he is deprived of the property pledged, whether by
his own fault, or not, or through accident, We have thought it to be more
humane to assist the creditor by means of the praetorian pledge, no matter how
he may have lost possession of the property, whether by his own fault or not,
or accidentally. For even though he ought to take such care of his pledge that
it may not suffer any damage, still, in order not to deal harshly with
creditors, We incline to a liberal interpretation of the law, and grant them
the right of recovery.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof August, during the fifth Consulate of
Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
TITLE XXIII.
WHERE PROPERTY is SEIZED IN PURSUANCE OP A JUDGMENT.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Gavinius.
It has frequently been stated in rescripts, that property taken in execution
under a judgment by order of a magistrate who had the right to issue it can be
held as a pledge and be sold, for the authority of the judge who issues the
order takes the place of a legal obligation based upon a contract.
Published at Rome, on the fifth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate
of Antoninus, Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
2. The Emperor Alexander to Valerian.
When property is seized as a pledge under a judgment, it is usually sold
officially by the judge who rendered the decree, and not by him
who asked that the order should be issued. If another purchaser should not
appear, or if one does appear, but should not offer a reasonable price, he in
whose favor the judgment was rendered shall be permitted to bid on the
property, according to law, and purchase it, just as anyone else can do.
Published on the sixth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and ^lianus, 224.
3. The Emperor Gordian to Antigonus.
It is more customary for pledges seized under a judgment by the Governor of the
province to be sold than to be taken possession of by the right of ownership.
Where, however, a purchaser cannot be found on account of the machinations of
the party against whom judgment was rendered, then the ownership of the
property is usually granted to the creditor by authority of the Emperor.
Published on the Idesof A'ugust, during the Consulate of Gordian and A viola,
240.
TITLE XXIV. WHERE PROPERTY is PLEDGED A SECOND TIME.
1. The Emperor Gordian to Lampo and Others.
It has already been decided that where property has been already pledged, it
can be repledged by the creditor, and the result is that an equitable action
should be granted to the subsequent creditor, provided he who has the right to
the pledge is protected as long as it remains subject to the lien of him who
encumbered it a second time.
Where, however, you have only pledged the usufruct of land and he who received
it pledged the land itself, the usufruct of which alone he was entitled to
without your consent, his creditor, by selling what was not liable to
encumbrance, cannot deprive you of the ownership of the same. But when it was
not the usufruct, but the land itself which was pledged to your creditor, and,
before the debt was paid by the owner, the second creditor sold the property,
the sale cannot be rescinded after the money has been paid, as this rule has
been established by the Imperial Decrees.
Published on the Idesof September, during the Consulate of Pius and Potnianus,
240.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Gemellus.
If the creditor did not sell the land which was pledged by your parents, but
himself encumbered it to another creditor of his own, after the facts have been
ascertained, you can recover the said land by application to the Governor of
the province, after having paid the sum due to the creditor.
Published on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Diocletian, Consul for the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third
time, 290.
TITLE XXV.
CONCERNING THE OFFSPRING OF PROPERTY WHICH HAS BEEN PLEDGED AND ALL OTHER
INCREASE OF THE SAME.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Mestrianus.
It was long since decided that the issue of a female slave who has been pledged
has the same status as its mother.
Published on the Idesof May, during the Consulate of Agricola and Clementinus,
231.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Annosus and Antoninus.
As you gave certain slaves in pledge to secure the payment of a sum of money
which you had borrowed, and you allege that the proceeds of the labor of said
slaves which the creditor obtained, or could have obtained, should first be
credited upon the interest, and afterwards upon the principal, and the debt
having been satisfied, if the creditor should refuse to accept the balance due,
it having been formally tendered and deposited under seal, the Governor of the
province will order the slaves to be returned to you.
Ordered on the fifth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
TITLE XXVI. CONCERNING THE RELEASE OF PLEDGES.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Proculus.
If you can prove before the Governor of the province that you have been
manumitted, and in possession of your freedom, and that she to whom you state
you were given in pledge was aware of this fact, the-creditor will appear to
have consented to release the pledge, and, this being the case, it is certain
that you were legally manumitted, and you cannot again be reduced to slavery by
the heir of the creditor.
Published on the twelfth of the Kalendsof May, during the second Consulate of
Antoninus and Geta.
2. The Same Emperors to Maternus.
If you can establish that the land in question was bought by you, and that
possession of the same was delivered to you with the knowledge and consent of
the woman who alleges that it was encumbered in her favor by the vendor, you
can plead an exception against her, for the obligation of a pledge is both
contracted and released by
consent.
Published on the second of the Idesof February, during the third
Consulate of Antoninus and Geta.
3. The Emperor Alexander to Taurus.
If your debtor, who without your knowledge, or against your consent, encumbered
all his property to you to secure the payment of
money loaned by you to him, should subsequently enter into a contract with the
State, this does not prejudice your rights.
Published on the third of the Idesof April, during the Consulate of Albinus and
Maximus.
4. The Emperor Gordian to Aquilinus.
As you state that you purchased from your debtor certain property which was
pledged to another, and you made the purchase with the knowledge of the person
holding the pledge, and he released the same, the encumbrance of the pledge
disappeared with his consent. If no new arrangement was made by which the
obligation was renewed, the property cannot be claimed on the ground that it is
subject to a lien.
Published on the eleventh of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Gordian
and Aviola.
5. The Same Emperor to Asclepiades.
You are not even now prevented from collecting the debt which you refer to, and
which you released by means of a contract which was void, and you can recover
the pledges in the ordinary way.
Published on the sixth of the Idesof September, during the Consulate of
Gordian, Consul for the second time, and Pompeianus.
6. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Argius.
If, at the time when the land was sold, creditors to whom it was encumbered had
been notified by publication, and being present, did not assert their rights,
they can be considered to have forfeited their claims to the property pledged.
Published on the third of the Idesof February, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and Aquilinus.
7. The Same Emperors to Paulinus.
It is evident that if the creditor in whose favor the land was encumbered by
your uncle, which had been evidenced by an instrument in writing, should order
the said bond to be returned to your uncle, she will be considered to have also
relinquished her right to the pledge.
Published on the fifth of the Idesof September, during the Consulate of
Diocletian, Consul for the third time, and Maximian.
8. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Apollonius.
If the Treasury sold the property which was hypothecated, and the other
creditors permitted this to be done in silence, it is clear that they have lost
the right of action which they had in the property, for public sales made by
the Treasury should not readily be set aside.
Published on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of
Diocletian, Consul for the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third
time.
9. The Same Emperors and Ctesars to Hermianus.As you allege that you paid a sum
of money bearing interest for your father-in-law in an action on mandate, the
Governor of the
province will provide for your indemnification by the restitution of the money
which you have paid for him, as well as the interest on the same; for if,
having received from the creditor the slaves which were pledged for the debt,
you delivered them to your father-in-law with the intention that your lien on
them should be released, the obligation having once been extinguished, cannot
be renewed.
Published on the tenth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of
Diocletian, Consul for the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third
time.
10. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Quintilla.
Debtors who, without the consent of their creditors, alienate property which
has been pledged or hypothecated to the latter, do not thereby release the
preceding obligation.
Given during the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors.
11. The Emperor Jiistinian to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
We, employing Our customary foresight, do hereby make provision with reference
to the pledging or hypothecation of property encumbered for the benefit of
creditors, and afterwards sold or disposed of in any other way by the debtors,
where the creditor has given his consent to the contract, and the title to the
property has again become legally vested in the former owners.
In cases of this kind, the opinions of the legal authorities vary, some of them
holding that the creditor is entitled to have his right to the pledge renewed
on account of the clause, "Property which he may hereafter acquire," which is
usually inserted in general hypothecations ; and others think that his right is
entirely extinguished.
It, however, appears to Us that he who has once consented to the alienation of
hypothecated property, and in this manner has relinquished his right, is not
entitled to claim it afterwards, on the ground that it had been encumbered to
him in the beginning, or to molest the person in possession of the same.
Given at Constantinople, after the fifth Consulate of Lampadius
and Orestes.
TITLE XXVII.
PLEDGES CAN EVEN BE HELD TO SECURE THE PAYMENT OF MONEY EVIDENCED BY A WRITTEN
INSTRUMENT.
1. The Emperor Gordian to Festus.
Your right to the pledge is lost if, after a novation has been made, you have
transferred the right of encumbrance to another, and security has been given
you that the property will not be held by way of pledge. If an agreement was
made between you and the person who, having afterwards become the owner of the
land, assumed a new obligation, in order that the said land might be held by
you in pledge, although you have brought a personal action and obtained a
judgment,
you still have a right to the property as being encumbered. But if you were
placed in possession, unless the money due, which was not secured, was either
paid or tendered to you by your debtor, you will not be compelled to restore
the property by means of an exception on the ground of fraud.
For you very properly assert that, if the debtors only tender the money which
they have given the said pledges to secure, they should not be heard, unless
they also pay the other which they simply received as a loan.
The rule does not apply to the second creditor, for he is not obliged to tender
to the first the amount of the debt which is evidenced by a written instrument.
Published on the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Gordian and Aviola.
TITLE XXVIII. CONCERNING THE SALE OF PLEDGES.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Pacata.
A tract of land, which has been pledged, can by no means be sold if the
creditor has collected the amount due out of the profits of the same, as the
pledge is, under such circumstances, released by operation of law.
Published on the Idesof January, during the Consulate of Maximus, Consul for
the second time, and -iSClianus.
2. The Same Emperor to Maxima.
A creditor who has alienated property which has been either hypothecated or
pledged to him is not considered to have sold the same subject to litigation,
because the debtor holds it by a precarious title.
Published on the twelfth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of
Maximus, Consul for the second time, and Julianus.
3. The Same Emperor to Lucianus.
An action will lie against the principal debtor or his surety in favor of
creditors who have sold property which has been hypothecated or pledged to them
for the amount which is lacking to satisfy their claims.
Published on the third of the Nones ofNovember, during the Consulate of
Maximus, Consul for the second time, and ^Elianus. 4. The Same to Crescens.
When a creditor is about to sell property which has been hypothecated or
pledged to him, he should notify the debtor, and act in good faith, and when
the sale takes place he should make the announcement in the presence of a
witness. Therefore, if you can prove that fraud was committed in the sale of
the country seat in question, which was pledged, apply to the judge having
jurisdiction of such matters, in
order that the action to which you are entitled in a case of this kind may be
brought.
Published on the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of Fuscus
and Dexter.
5. The Same Emperor to Sossianus.
If you are ready to pay the balance of the debt, the Governor of the province
will give you the selection of the judge by whom the amount shall be
ascertained, and if the adverse party fails to appear in court, or proceeds to
sell the property after you have tendered him more than the sum to which he is
entitled, the fraudulent alienation will not affect your right.
6. The Emperor Gordian to Rogatus.
So long as the amount due is not paid in full to the creditor, he does not lose
his right to sell the property, even if he has already collected the greater
part of the debt.
Published on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of
Pius and Pontianus.
7. The Same Emperor to Carus.
If payment has not been made, and the creditor should sell the property which
had been pledged to him when the contract does not contain any provision to the
contrary, it would be unjust to set the sale aside as if fraud had been
committed, and you should not sue the purchaser, but the creditor.
Published on the fifth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of Pius
and Pontianus.
8. The Same Emperor to Maximum.
If, before the property pledged was sold, you tendered your creditor the money
which you owed him, and he refused to accept it, and witnesses were called to
attest this, and you deposited the money, and matters to-day remain in the same
condition, the sale of said property is not valid. But if you tendered the
payment of the money before the sale was completed, and it was legally made, it
cannot be rescinded.
Published on the third of the Nonesof April, during the Consulate of Gordian
and Aviola.
9. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Cillus.
Where property has been specifically encumbered in your favor, and your debtors
refused to make payment, and the indebtedness was incurred in good faith, you,
observing the legal formalities, should sell the property, for it will be
apparent from the price obtained for the pledge whether it is sufficient to
satisfy the debt, since if anything is lacking, We do not forbid you to have
recourse to other property of the debtors, by virtue of the agreement.
Published on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of
Diocletian, Consul for the third time, and Maximian.
10. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Rufinits.Anyone who has possession of
property which has been pledged, and it is purchased by another person who
represents him, continues to hold it; for as he conducts the business for
himself, he is not considered to have alienated it. The creditor who buys land
that has been pledged, but not through someone who represents him, or does not
appropriate it for himself, cannot prejudice the rights of the debtor; but the
property remains in the same condition in which it was before this fraudulent
act took place.
If, however, he should purchase it from the debtor, who sold it to him, it
would establish a bad precedent to set aside the sale made with the consent of
both parties, if neither the fraud of the adverse party, nor the employment of
duress by him is proved. Therefore, if you can show by clear, positive evidence
that the creditor always held possession through a fictitious purchaser, and
that he afterwards bought in good faith the property which was fraudulently
disposed of, you can compel the creditor to make restitution of the same, after
having tendered him the payment of the debt with interest.

Diocletian, Consul for the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third

11. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Rufina.

20. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Sabinus.
If nothing was specially agreed upon, and the pledges were sold by the
creditor, in accordance with the terms of the contract, for a larger sum than

TITLE XXIX.
A DEBTOR CANNOT PREVENT THE SALE OF THE PROPERTY
PLEDGED.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Marcellus.
If there are any persons who desire to purchase the land which has been
encumbered to you, they will not be prevented from doing so by the terms of the
will, under which the debtor is forbidden to sell any real property belonging
to him, and the penalty is added that, if he does, the land shall be forfeited
to the Treasury, for it is clear that by a provision of this kind the rights of
the creditor are prejudiced.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Aper and
Maximus.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Nepos.
The notice given to a debtor by his creditor not to sell any of the property
pledged to him, or to those who wish to purchase it from him not to buy it, is
only effective where he tenders the entire amount of the debt, both principal
and interest, to the creditor, and the latter refuses to accept it, and the
debtor then deposits the money in the presence of competent witnesses, as is
required. Even if he only pays a certain proportion of the principal and
interest due, the sale of the property pledged cannot be prevented. Under these
circumstances, the purchaser does not become a possessor in bad faith, although
he may be aware that notice has been served upon the creditor by the debtor.

and Aviola.
TITLE XXX.
WHERE PROCEEDINGS ARE INSTITUTED ON ACCOUNT OF THE SALE OF A PLEDGE.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Agrippa.
If, having applied to the Governor of the province, it should be proved that
your creditor, who had a right to sell the pledges, made a fraudulent sale of
the tract of land, the Governor will order him to pay you damages and interest.
When, however, the said creditor, against whom judgment was rendered, is unable
to pay the money, and it is proved that the purchaser bought the land in bad
faith, and you tender him the amount for which the land was sold with interest,
the Governor will order the purchaser in bad faith to restore you the land with
its profits.
Published on the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of Alexander.
2. The Same Emperor to JEmilius.
Your father, or yourself (if his estate belongs to you as his heir) can demand
from the possessors the slaves whom you allege were illegally sold by your
father's creditor. If, however, title to them has
been acquired by usucaption, your father can collect the price paid for the
same from the creditor who illegally disposed of them.
Published on the third of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Alexander.  3. The Same to Claudius.
If your wife should prove before the Governor of the province that she owed
thirty aurei,and that her creditor sold her slaves who had been pledged for
that sum, for twenty aurei,and afterwards became insolvent, he will order the
slaves to be restored to her, after the price paid for them has been refunded.
Published on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of
Maximus, Consul for the second time, and ^lianus.
4. The Emperor Gordian to Eudemus.
As you state that a sale of the land encumbered was not made by your creditor
in good faith, for the reason that the formalities which are customary in the
sale of property pledged were not observed, having gone before the Governor of
the province, you will have a right to proceed by a competent action, not only
against your creditor, but also against the party in possession, if you can
prove that he participated in the fraud with your creditor; so that the
transaction which is proved to have taken place in bad faith, having been
rescinded, an account of the profits and of the loss which it may appear that
you have sustained, may be rendered.
Published on the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Sabinus, Consul for
the second time, and Venustus.
5. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Nonia.
If the purchaser, without being guilty of fraud, bought the property pledged
which was sold by the creditor before his debt was paid, the successor of the
latter, and not the heir of the purchaser who is in possession of the property,
should be sued.
Ordered at Nicomedia, on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the
Consulate of the Caesars.
TITLE XXXI. CONCERNING THE RELEASE OF PLEDGES.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Antiochia.
The heir of a portion of the estate cannot receive his share of the pledges
unless he pays the entire debt.
Published on the third of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Albinus
and .^Emilianus, 207.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Domitius.
You should understand that the lien of a pledge continues to exist even after a
personal action has been brought.
Published on the twelfth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of Sabinus
and Venustus, 241.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Florus.
If the amount of the debt has been paid either by the delivery or the sale of
property, and the claim of the person against whom you filed your petition has
been satisfied, and you can prove this before the Governor of the province, or
if any balance is due, and you have tendered it, and the creditor having
refused to accept it, you have sealed and deposited it, the Governor will see
that the property pledged is restored to you, for it is clear that by the
Perpetual Edict an action is granted to the debtor where the money has been
paid to the creditor; or, if it was his fault that it was not paid, it is
perfectly evident that he can legally be compelled to return the pledge.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof October, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors.
TITLE XXXII.
WHERE ONE OF SEVERAL HEIRS OF THE DEBTOR OR CREDITOR EITHER PAYS OR RECEIVES
His SHARE OF THE DEBT.
1. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus to Taurus.
It is a clear and undoubted rule of law that where a creditor dies leaving
several heirs, while a personal action is divided among all by the Law of the
Twelve Tables, the entire amount of the property pledged is encumbered to each
one of them.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Valerian,
Consul for the third time, and Gallienus, Consul for the fourth time, 258.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the C&sars, to Claudia.
The personal action is divided among the heirs in proportion to . their
respective shares of the estate, but where several pieces of property are
pledged, and possessed by different individuals, the case is different, as the
right to claim the same does not attach to the person but to the property, and
as those who are in possession are not liable in proportion to their shares of
the estate, but for the full amount of the claim, so they must either pay all
that is due, or relinquish possession of what they hold.
Signed at Antioch, on the fifth of the Nonesof ....
TITLE XXXIII.
WHERE THE PAYMENT OF MONEY is NOT MADE AFTER A
CONTRACT FOR THE PLEDGING OF PROPERTY HAS BEEN
ENTERED INTO.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Illarus.If (as you assert) you have
given security for money which was not paid to you, and you can prove that the
pledge was delivered, you
can bring a real action; for the mere delivery of a pledge where no money was
paid will not hold, unless it appears that an obligation has been contracted.
Under these circumstances, the actual facts of the case will protect you, if
you have possession of the property pledged, and your adversary institutes
proceedings against you.
Published on the Kalendsof September, under the Consulate of Lateranus and
Rufinus, 198.
2. The Emperor Alexander to Peregrinus.
If (as you now assert) the alleged creditor did not pay your wife, who gave the
pledge, any money, but extorted from her security which is not valid, her
property will not be encumbered by the terms of a fraudulent document executed
in violation of the truth.
Without date or designation of Consulate.
TITLE XXXIV.
CONCERNING THE RIGHT TO OBTAIN OWNERSHIP OF THE PROPERTY OF A DEBTOR.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Nicola.
When you desire to obtain the ownership of property which has been pledged, the
names of the debtors who you say have failed to make payment must be given, and
you must state whether you have complied with the requisite formalities, for
you are informed that you cannot obtain the ownership of the entire property
pledged by your debtor, even though all of it was, in general terms, encumbered
in
your favor.
Published on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of
Alexander, Consul for the third time, and Dio, 230.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Justa.
If your creditor obtained from Us the right to ownership of the property
pledged, and a year after the rescript was issued accepted interest from you,
he is considered to have relinquished the benefit of the said rescript.
Published on the day before the Nonesof December, during the Consulate of Pius
and Pontianus, 239.
3. The Emperor Justinian to Demosthenes, Praetorian Prefect.
We think that the ancient rule which, however, so far as documents are
concerned, never appeared to be clear, should be absolutely abolished, and, in
fact, should be replaced by better remedies. Therefore, the right of public
sale and the power of release within a year, which were granted by the ancient
law in the case of pledges which anyone wished to acquire by the right of
ownership, We have ascertained only by the perusal of books, for We have never
seen a pledge publicly sold in this way.
(1) Hence, We decree that if anyone should pledge his property to his creditor,
and it was provided in the agreement how the pledge should be sold, whether at
a certain time, or in some other way, whatever was agreed upon in the contract
between the creditor and the debtor with reference to the sale of said property
shall be observed. If, however, no agreement was made, the creditor shall be
given permission to sell the pledge two years after notice has been given to
the debtor, or after judgment has been rendered, the term to be computed from
the day when the notice was issued, or the judgment published.
(2) But when no one appears who desires to purchase the property and it becomes
necessary for the creditor himself to acquire it by the right of ownership, We
decree that, in cases of this kind, the following shall be observed, namely:
that if the debtor is present, notice shall be served upon him, even after the
lapse of two years; or if he is absent, the creditor shall apply to the
tribunal of the province, and ask the judge to issue a summons for the debtor
to appear at a time which he shall designate, which summons shall be served by
the court attendant, and contain what is claimed by the creditor, and a certain
date shall be fixed, within which, if the debtor should be found, he can pay
the debt and recover the pledge.
If, however, he should not be found, the judge must designate a certain time
within which he shall be permitted to appear, tender the money due, and release
the pledge.
(3) If, however, after the designated time has expired, the debtor should
either not be found, or refuse to pay the full amount claimed, the creditor can
then apply to the Emperor and petition him for the right to acquire the
ownership of said property, and permission shall be granted him to do so. After
this has taken place the debtor shall, through motives of humanity, be entitled
to the term of two years to redeem his property, which shall be reckoned from
the day when the Imperial Decree was issued; and he shall be allowed to pay the
creditor, who has become the owner of the property, his debt, with interest,
and reimburse him for any losses which he may have sustained, the amount of
which the creditor must prove by his oath, and the debtor will then be entitled
to recover his pledge.
Where, however, the said term of two years has elapsed, the creditor shall have
a perfect title to the property, and his ownership will become irrevocable.
(4) But if the pledge should be found to be worth less than the debt, the
creditor shall have the right to proceed against his debtor for the deficiency.
When the value of the pledge and the amount of the debt are found to be equal,
there is no doubt that the creditor can retain the entire property previously
pledged. If, however, the debt should amount to less than the value of the
pledge, then, by Our law, the excess shall be reserved for other creditors to
whom the property was not pledged, or for the debtor himself.
And, that no difficulty may arise with reference to the excess, permission is
hereby granted to the creditor or owner to furnish proper security for the
payment of the said excess to the debtor.
(5) When, however, the creditor, after having, as owner, obtained possession of
the property pledged, desires to sell it, he shall have permission to do so,
and if anything over and above the amount of his claim should be collected it
shall be reserved for the debtor.
But when any doubt arises with reference to the sale, for instance, if it
should be asserted that a lower price was paid than the property was worth, the
creditor will be obliged to make oath that he was guilty of no machination or
fraud, but that he sold the property for as much as he could obtain for it; and
he shall only be compelled to return to the debtor any surplus which he may
have sworn to. If, however, it should be ascertained from the oath of the
creditor that he received less than the amount of the debt from the sale, he
will have a right to bring suit against the debtor for the remainder.
(6) We desire that there shall be a judicial decision as to the value of the
property pledged, if it should remain in the hands of the creditor, and the
judge must determine whether it is more or less than the indebtedness, and
whatever he may hold on this point will establish the value of the pledge.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof April, during the
fifth Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
TITLE XXXV.
CONCERNING CONTRACTS RELATING TO PLEDGES AND THE
ABOLITION OF THE LAW OF CONDITIONAL AVOIDANCE WITH
REFERENCE TO PLEDGES.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Victorinus.
He who entered into an agreement that, unless within a certain time he paid the
money which he had borrowed, his creditors could sell the property
hypothecated, did not make a valid contract, for he included in it the right to
which his creditor was entitled when he received the pledge. Therefore,
according to the Common Law, the creditor can sell the property.
Published during the Idesof October, during the Consulate of
Alexander, 223.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Cassars, to Dionysius.
If a third party has questioned the title of the purchaser to the property
which you sold him, and you have given the latter a written pledge or
hypothecation of another tract of land to protect him against eviction, under
the condition that if he should not be evicted from the land which you sold him
he will return to you the premises encumbered to him by the second contract,
and that, if judgment should be rendered in this case against the person who
raised the question of title, the judge will order the terms of the agreement
to be complied with, if the matter remains in its former condition, and as the
pur-
chaser is secure, against eviction, the land which was hypothecated shall be
restored to you.
Ordered at Sirmium, on the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the
Cassars.
3. The Emperor Constantine to the People.
As the harshness of the law of conditional avoidance is conspicuous among other
abuses, We have decided to declare it void, and to abolish it. Therefore, if
anyone has been oppressed by a contract of this kind, he shall be relieved by
this law, which annuls all past and present agreements of this kind, and
forbids them to be made hereafter. We, however, order that creditors who have
lost their property by this law shall have a right to recover what they have
paid.
Given on the second of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of
Constantine, Consul for the seventh time, and Constantius, 326.
TITLE XXXVI. CONCERNING EXCEPTIONS OR PRESCRIPTIONS.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Claudius.
In accordance with the terms of the ancient law, those who are indebted to an
estate are liable to each one of the heirs in proportion to his share of said
estate; but if you have paid all the money due to those only whom the testator
mentioned by name when making the distribution, you can defend yourself against
the others, by an exception on the ground of bad faith, if they should bring
suit.
Published on the tenth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of the two
Aspers, 213.
2. The Same Emperor to Julius.
If judgment has not been rendered against you, you can bring an action to
recover your share in the house to which you allege that you are entitled, for
an exception on the ground of res judicatacan only be pleaded against the
party, or his heirs between whom the case was heard, and judgment rendered.
Published on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of
Antoninus, Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
3. The Same Emperor to Vital.
If you did not bring the action of guardianship against your brother, who was
formerly your guardian, do so now, and do not fear that an exception based on
an agreement will be filed, provided you can prove that fraud and deceit have
been committed, for a replication on the ground of deception, when pleaded,
renders the action a bona fideone, and excludes the effect of any fraud which
may have been committed.
4. The Emperor Alexander to Julianus and Others.
As you state that the case has not yet finally been decided but merely
continued, there is no doubt that your right to defend yourself still remains
unimpaired.
Published on the second of the Nonesof October, during the Consulate of
Maximus, Consul for the second time, and .^Elianus, 224.
5. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Basilius.
Although the interdict Unde vimust be resorted to within a year, still it is
evident that, by'the authority of the law, a perpetual exception can be pleaded
by him who, although having been violently attacked, has, nevertheless,
retained possession of the property.
Ordered on the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of the abovementioned
Emperors.
6. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Helena.
If an agreement was made with reference to an exception, you can, without
restriction of time, reply by pleading an exception on the ground of fraud.
Ordered on the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of the above-mentioned
Emperors.
7. The Same Emperors and Caesars to Menander.
If your debtor paid you a smaller amount than he owed you, and you did not give
him a release, you will not be prevented from bringing suit to recover what is
proved not to have been paid, and you can in your replication plead an
exception on the ground of fraud against the One founded on the agreement.
Ordered on the second of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
8. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Aurelius.
The peremptory exception which it was sufficient to plead in the first place,
even though this may have been neglected, can be filed at any time before
judgment is rendered.
Ordered on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
9. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Mutianus.
If you think that the plaintiff cannot prove his claim, it is not necessary for
you to make any defence. When, however, while acknowledging the validity of it,
you allege that you are protected by an exception, cognizance of the exception
alone should be taken. For if you have any doubt of the justice of your
opponent's cause, your exception ought only to be considered after the
plaintiff has proved his claim in accordance with his allegations, for then it
will be proper for it to be examined.
Ordered on the third of the Nonesof November, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
10. The Same Emperors and C&sars to Aquilina.
Plaintiffs do not protect themselves by means of exceptions, the benefits of
which are granted to defendants under certain circumstances, but they can
establish their claims by means of replications, if they have any which are
valid.
Ordered at Nicomedia, on the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
11. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Neo.
It is settled that while the case remains unchanged, those who represent the
parties can avail themselves of the same exceptions and defences to which their
principals would have been entitled.
12. The Emperor Julian to Julian, Count of the East.
If an advocate, during the progress of a case, should desire to avail himself
of a dilatory exception which he neglected to make use of in the beginning, and
he is deprived of this resource, but still perseveres in setting up this ill-
timed defence, he shall be fined a pound of gold.
Given at Antioch, on the seventh of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of
Julian, Consul for the eighth time, and Sallust, 363.
13. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Symmachus, Proconsul of Africa.
The authority of the law declares that exceptions to jurisdiction must always
be pleaded by litigants at the beginning of a case.
Given at Ravenna, on the fifth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate
of Honorius, Consul for the tenth time, and Theodosius, Consul for the sixth
time.
TITLE XXXVII. CONCERNING DISPUTED PROPERTY. 1. The Emperors Severus and
Antoninus to Paulina.As the creditor has sold the pledge, a purchase of
property subject to contest cannot be considered to have been made, even though
the debtor may have forbidden the sale to take place.
Published on the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Aper and Maximus, 208.
Extract from Novel 112, Chapter I. Latin Text.
Disputed property is that with reference to whose ownership a question has
arisen between the possessor and another person who claims it, where either an
action has been brought, or a petition presented to the Emperor, and a judge
been appointed by him subsequently to take cognizance of the case.
2. The Emperor Constantine to the People of the Provinces.
While« a suit is pending, the plaintiff is not permitted to transfer any rights
of action which are in litigation, or any property which he alleges is retained
by the defendant, to any person connected with him, or to any stranger, either
by donation, sale, or any other kind of a contract whatsoever; and, if he
should do so, the case shall still proceed just as if nothing had been done.
Given on the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Bassus and Ablavius, 333311..
3. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Tattian, Praetorian
Prefect.
Where anyone who has bequeathed, either by a will or a codicil, any property,
the title to which is in dispute, or any claim of doubtful validity, or any
movable or immovable property, to Our Treasury or to a person in authority, or
to anyone else, or has left the same under a trust, or as part of an estate,
neither Our Treasury, nor anyone else shall have the right to contest the
ownership of the same, or appear in court, but a judicial appraisement of it
must be made, and it shall be delivered to those to whom the rights of action
for property in dispute have been bequeathed. The heirs, themselves, should
conduct the case, and claim, at their own risk, the said property whose title
is contested, and which has been left by will. It has been decided with
reference to written claims which are of doubtful validity that the heirs of
persons who have left bequests to the Treasury, or to other legatees, after
having estimated the value of the same, can sue those who they may consider
liable.
Given at Thessalonica, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof July, and again at
Constantinople, on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the
Consulate of Gratian, Consul for the fifth time, and Theodosius, 380.
4. The Emperor Justinian to John, Prastorian Prefect.We decree that if anyone
should, while a case is pending, transfer to any person whomsoever either the
rights of action or the property involved, whether the latter knows or is
ignorant that the title to said actions or property is in dispute, a certain
distinction shall be observed between the contracting parties, so that when
anyone knowingly receives such property either through a sale, a donation, or
by virtue of any other kind of a contract, he is hereby notified that he will
be compelled not only to return the property, but also will be deprived of the
price of the same, but the profit shall not accrue to him who made the sale but
to the Treasury, to which he shall be required by law to
pay an equal sum.
If, however, the purchaser should buy property whose title was in dispute,
without being aware of the fact, or should obtain it by any other kind of a
contract, then the alienation shall be considered void, and the price shall be
returned to the purchaser, together with a sum equal to one-third of the amount
of the same; for it is only just
that on account of the fraudulent intent and secret duplicity of the vendor,
who did not inform the purchaser that the title to the property was being
contested in court, he should be punished by being forced to pay a sum equal to
the third part of the price, as We have already decreed.
This penalty shall not only be imposed in the case of other contracts, but also
with reference to donations, so that a true appraisement having been made, he
who transferred the property to another shall be fined, and all instruments
evidencing transactions of this kind shall have no force or effect.
All contracts relating to dowries, ante-nuptial donations, compromises, or the
distribution of estates, as well as those providing for the disposal of
property by means of legacies or trusts, or where rights of action have been
given or accepted, are, however, not subject to the provisions of this law.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof November, after the fifth Consulate of
Lampadius and Orestes, 532.
Extract from Novel 112, Chapter I. Latin Text.
At present, if the heir is successful, he must deliver to the legatee the
property of which he appears to be the owner, but when judgment is rendered
against him, and he loses the case, only the result of a lawsuit is considered
to have been bequeathed to him, and therefore the other party interested should
be present at the trial, to see that there is no collusion.
TITLE XXXVIII. CONCERNING THE CONTRACTION OP A STIPULATION.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Secundus.
Although the letter which you have inserted in your petition does not set forth
that he to whom security was given did not stipulate, still, if the transaction
took place between parties who were present, it must be believed that the
stipulation preceded, and the response followed.
Adopted on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of
Severus, Consul for the third time, and Victorinus, 201.
2. The Same Emperors to Petronius.
If you stipulated that the money should be paid to your daughter, whom you had
under your control, you will not be prevented from requiring the obligation to
be complied with.
Published on the Nonesof November, during the Consulate of Faustinus and
Rufinus, 211.
3. The Emperor Antoninus to Hadrian.
If, when you lent the money, you did so in the name of Julianus, the
stipulation was made with reference to a person who was absent.
As a stipulation entered into under such circumstances is void, you understand
that no obligation exists, except that contracted through the property, hence
if Julianus should collect the money from your g debtor, and you have ratified
the payment of the same, you will be entitled to an action against him on the
ground of voluntary agency. Published on the sixth of the Kalendsof March,
during the Consulate of Prassens and Extricatus.
4. The Emperor Alexander to Sabina.
According to the opinion of my friend, the Jurist Domitius Ulpianus, Prefect of
Subsistence, the woman who wished to have power to bequeath half of her dowry
at the time of her death and made a stipulation to that effect is considered to
have stipulated that the said portion of her dowry should be restored to her
when she died.
5. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csssars, to Isidora.
In accordance with what has been frequently decided, the laws do not always
permit a man to be compelled to do what he agreed to by a mere promise without
consideration. But as you allege that your adversary agreed under the
stipulation to pay you, in addition, an amount equal to the value of the
property, if he did not fulfill his contract, and as, after the case was
brought into court, this condition of the obligation is shown to have existed,
it is established that you have good ground to demand the payment of the said
sum which was also included in this stipulation.
6. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Erotius.
You ought to have known that where, under a compromise, something was agreed to
be given, whether a certain or an uncertain amount was stipulated for, it can
be recovered.
Ordered at Sirmium, on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the
Consulate of the above-mentioned Emperors.
7. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Antonius.
The absence of either a guardian or a curator does not, in any way, affect the
validity of a stipulation, as there is no doubt that a woman, who is under the
age of twenty-five years, can enter into a stipulation during the absence of
her curator.
Ordered on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of the
Ceesars.
8. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Posidonius and Others.
The promise to furnish a slave who will never die is impossible of execution,
but anyone who stipulates for the payment of money after the death of a slave
can legally demand it.
Ordered on the twelfth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
9. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Capita.
If,when terrified by the fear of death or corporeal suffering, you bound
yourself to Zeno under a stipulation, you can defend yourself against him by an
exception on this ground, if he should bring an action. Where, however, nothing
of this kind was proved, your promise will not be void merely because you
brought a criminal accusation against your adversary, or intend to do so, as
the stipulation was not entered into from some base motive, but for a
commendable reason. But if the money was promised as a consideration for not
bringing a criminal accusation, the demand will be refused, as it is not legal
to make agreements of this kind.
Ordered on the fifth of the Idesof October, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
10. The Emperor Leo to Erythrius, Prsetorian Prefect.
All stipulations, even if they are not expressed in formal or direct words, but
in any words whatsoever, with the consent of the contracting parties, and they
are in conformity with the laws, shall be valid.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Martianus and Zeno, 469.
11. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Prsetorian Prefect.
We, intending to absolutely abolish certain technical difficulties of the
ancients, namely: that where anyone has made a stipulation, or left anything by
way of legacy, or under a trust, by the terms of his will, in the following
words: "After my death," "At the time of my death," or "The day before my
death," We decree that everything included in a stipulation, a contract, an
agreement, or any disposition made by a testator in his will, which is to take
effect after his death, or the day before he dies, shall, nevertheless, be
valid, in accordance with the tenor of said contract or will.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Idesof December, during the
Consulate of Our Lord the Emperor Justinian, 528.
12. The Same Emperor to Menna, Prsetorian Prefect.
Desiring to elucidate the great obscurity of the ancient laws, which, up to
this time, has afforded a great opportunity for the protraction of litigation,
We order that where anyone stipulates that he will either do or give something
at a certain time, or both, or promises what the stipulator desires, and then
adds that if what was promised should not be done at the designated time, he
will pay a certain penalty, the debtor is hereby advised that he cannot avoid
the penalty to which he subjected himself, on the ground that no one notified
him, but he will be liable to the said penalty according to the terms of the
stipulation, even without any notice, as he should retain in his memory what he
agreed to do, and not require to be reminded of it by others. Given at
Constantinople, on the ninth of the Idesof April, during the fifth Consulate of
Decius, 529.
13. The Same Emperor to Julian, Prsetorian Prefect.
In order to settle the disputes arising out of the ancient law, We decree, in
general terms, that every stipulation, whether it consists in giving anything,
doing anything, or both giving something or performing some act, shall be
transmitted both to and against heirs, whether any special mention has been
made of them or not, for why should what is just, so far as the principal
parties are concerned, not be transmitted both in favor of and against their
successors?
And, as it is held that stipulations of this description, having reference to
something which should be given, can still be performed by heirs, the subtle
and superfluous opinion, by which it is decided that what is imposed on one
person cannot possibly be executed by another, is hereby abolished. For, as the
nature of all men is more or less similar, why cannot any of them do what
others can, and why should the wills of men be void on account of an over nice
distinction
of this kind?
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof August, during the
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
14. The Same to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
It is now proper to dispose of an important question which frequently comes up
in the tribunals, in order to prevent it from causing any further annoyance to
the Government. In many contracts, and especially in those having reference to
the payment of interest, it is usual for the stipulations to be entered into
through the agency of slaves, who, induced by want of fidelity, at times avail
themselves of this opportunity to raise controversies; as, in some instances,
it is. contended that the slave did not make the stipulation, or asserted that
he did not belong to the person by whom the terms of the written contract
should be carried out; and in others, it is alleged that the papers were not
drawn up by slaves but by the parties themselves, who were present, hence a
doubt arose whether proof should be offered that the parties were present.
Therefore, as it is convenient for slaves to be employed in making contracts,
and where it is stated that the principals themselves were present, and this
was not the case, on account of the dignity of the persons involved, or because
they are women (as the natural modesty of the latter does not permit them to be
present during every transaction) , We order that documents of this kind shall
be valid under all circumstances; and, whether they set forth that they were
drawn up by slaves, who were said to belong to certain persons, or not, the
slave shall, by all means, be considered to have been present, and to have
drawn up the stipulation, and that it has been acquired by the person stated
therein to be his master, and that no question shall arise whether the slave
himself, or his master, in whose behalf it is stated in the document that the
stipulation was made, was present. And if the transaction is said to have taken
place between the parties, who were present, this also shall" be believed,
provided both of them were in the town at the time when the instrument was
drawn up; unless he
who alleges that he himself or his adversary was absent can prove by the clear
and manifest testimony of perfectly reliable witnesses to whom no exception can
be taken, or better still, by documentary evidence, that either he or his
adversary was not in the town on the day when the stipulation was made. Written
documents of this kind should be considered valid on account of their advantage
to the contracting parties.
Given on the Kalendsof November, after the fifth Consulate of Lampadius and
Orestes, 531.
15. The Same Emperor to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
Where anyone promises the stipulator to build him a house at the time of his
death, an agreement of this description would have appeared impossible to the
ancient authorities. If the intention of the contracting parties is considered,
it seems to Us to be very probable that a transaction of this kind can take
place, so that an obligation which began at the time of the death of the
promisor would render his heirs liable until it was carried into effect. For no
one can be found who is so foolish as to make a stipulation with the idea that
a building could be erected in a moment of time, or that anyone at the point of
death could think that he himself would be able to finish such a work.
(1) Therefore, We order that if anything of this kind should happen, the heirs
of the promisor will be liable to execute what he promised at the time of his
death, just as if the heir was expressly mentioned, although this may not have
been done. For if the stipulation provided that something should be given, as
this could be transmitted against the heirs, so, where some act was to be
performed, even though it was promised at the time of death, the heirs will
still be obliged to carry it out, just as in the case where the stipulation
provided for something to be given, in order that no distinction may exist
between the performance of an act and the bestowal of a gift, but Our law may
be consistent in every respect.
We decree that this rule shall be observed in the same way with reference to
legacies.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof November, during the
fifth Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 532.
TITLE XXXIX. CONCERNING STIPULATIONS WHICH ARE VOID.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Paulinus.
You are not bound by a stipulation which you made, while under the age of
puberty, without the intervention of your guardian.
Published during the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Laetus, Consul for
the second time, and Cerealis, 216.
2. The Emperor Alexander to Menophilus.
The freedom of marriage has been established from ancient times, and therefore
agreements providing that it shall not be lawful for the
parties to be separate are void, and it has been decided that stipulations by
whose terms penalties are imposed upon those who obtain divorces are not to be
considered valid.
Published on the third of the Nonesof February, during the Consulate of
Maximus, Consul for the second time, and ^Elianus, 224.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Isidora.
As a verbal obligation cannot be contracted by persons who are absent, so no
one can stipulate for anything to be given or restored to another, who is not
subject to his authority, unless he is present. Therefore, as your daughter
died during marriage, and you consented that half of her dowry should be held
by her husband, in the name of a surviving son, and the other half be given to
your grandson, or if he should not be alive, that it should be restored to
Julian in accordance with the terms of a contract which you allege was entered
into, and your grandson having died first, you state that on account of his
absence the stipulation made in favor of Julian was not valid, and for this
reason you ask that all the property which you provided for by the terms of
your stipulation shall be restored to you, apply to the Governor of the
province with reference to your stipulation, so that the allegations of the
parties having been examined, the amount which it is to your interest should be
restored to Julian, and which is now uncertain, may be determined, and he may
decide how much shall be
paid to you.
Published on the Idesof December, during the Consulate of Diocletian, Consul
for the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third time, 290.
4. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Domna.
It is clear that you have no right of action under the instrument in which a
stipulation contrary to good morals was made with reference to a succession, as
all provisions against good morals, whether set forth in a contract or in a
stipulation, are of no force or effect.
. 5. The Same Emperors and Czesars to Aquilina.
A right of action, indeed, arises where a stipulation is entered into through
fraud or fear; still, it can be barred by an exception on either of these
grounds.
Ordered on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
6. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Septimius. ,If your grandmother stipulated
that the money which she lent should be paid to herself, and to Eustolius, she
cannot by such a stipulation obtain anything for the benefit of someone not
under her control. But if Eustolius, himself, stipulated in his own name that
the money should be paid to him, there is no doubt that the right to the
obligation is not personally acquired by him.
Ordered on the fifth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
TITLE XL. WHERE Two OR MORE PERSONS STIPULATE AND PROMISE.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and, Maximian to Paulina.
Where two or more persons jointly enter into an agreement for the delivery of
certain property, an action for the full amount of the same will lie against
either one of them, if circumstances require it, as long as the property
remains in the same condition.
Published on the third of the Nonesof December, during the Consulate of
Maximus, Consul for the second time, and Aquilinus, 286.
2. The Same Emperors to Diogenes.
Where two persons have promised to pay the money, a creditor cannot be
prevented from collecting his debt from whichever one he may choose to sue.
Therefore, if you can prove that you, having been sued, have paid the entire
indebtedness, the Governor of the province will not hesitate to assist you
against him with whom you jointly borrowed the money.
Ordered on the fifth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of
Diocletian, Consul for the third time, and Maximian.
Extract from Novel 99, Chapter I. Latin Text.
The above-mentioned rule will apply where a special agreement was made by the
parties that each one of them should be liable for the entire amount of the
debt, and if one of them was insolvent, a part or all of it could be collected
from the other, even if he were absent, for when both of them are present they
should appear in court, the case be heard with reference to both, and judgment
be rendered against both; and this may be done by administration if the judge
was specially appointed for that purpose.
When, however, a special agreement was not made with reference to payment, as
above stated, they will each be liable for half of the debt. But if they agreed
that both should be liable, and both of them are present and solvent, they must
be compelled to discharge the indebtedness.
3. The Same Emperors and Caesars to Fabianus.
You should have stated in your petition whether each of you bound yourselves
for only a part, or for the entire amount of the obligation, and whether you
promised jointly as two debtors, as if each of you only bound himself for a
portion, the terms of the contract cannot be violated; if, however, both of you
obligated yourselves for the full amount, the creditor cannot by a rescript be
deprived of his right to sue either of you.
Ordered at Byzantium, on the Idesof April, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors.
4. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Andronicus.Where money has been lent to one
person alone and others have promised jointly with him to pay it, the laws do
not permit them to be
released from liability, if the money should not be paid in accordance with the
terms of the contract.
Ordered at Sirmium, on the fifth of the Idesof February, during the Consulate
of the Csesars.
5. The Emperor Justinian to John, Prsetorian Prefect.Where several debtors have
agreed to pay different debts to their creditors, or one creditor has two or
more debtors, or, on the other hand, where several creditors have but one
debtor, and some of the debtors acknowledge the obligation due to certain
creditors either by making payment, or in other ways of interrupting
prescription, which We have found inserted in former laws whose scope We have
enlarged, or where certain debtors have acknowledged the claims of one
creditor, or where there are several creditors and there being but one debtor,
he acknowledges the indebtedness to one or more of said creditors, and the
question arose whether he or they ought to be granted permission to sue the
others, whose portions of the debt they have paid without the latter being
permitted to plead prescription, or, in case some of the debtors having
acknowledged the debt, or having been defeated in court, the others should be
excluded from making any defence, it seems to Us to be consistent with the
dictates of humanity that, where prescription has been interrupted, or
acknowledgment of the debt has been made with reference to one and the same
contract, all the parties should be compelled to pay the debt at the same time,
whether there are several debtors, or only one of them, or whether there are
several creditors, or not more than one.
Hence We decree that in every case above mentioned, where part of the debt has
been paid or acknowledged, or the other debtors have been notified in writing
that they are liable, the other creditors shall enjoy the benefit. Therefore
they shall be jointly responsible and none of them will be permitted to profit
by the unfairness of another, as a single contract is derived from one source
or liability, and a debt is incurred by the same act.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof September, after the fifth Consulate
of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
TITLE XLI. CONCERNING SURETIES AND MANDATORS.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Lysias.
If Lysias was sentenced to exile and a loss of part of his property, he is only
liable to his creditors for the part which he retained. But those who became
his sureties can be sued under former laws.
Published on the Idesof October, during the Consulate of Severus, Consul for
the third time, and Victorinus.
2. The Same Emperors to Plocius.
A creditor who received both pledges and a surety for the same debt shall be
permitted to sue the surety for the money for which the
latter rendered himself liable (if he desires to do so), but if he does sue
him, he should transfer to him his right to the pledges. When, however, the
creditor has a lien on the said pledges or hypothecations because of some other
claim, he cannot be compelled to transfer them until the entire indebtedness
has been paid.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of Aper,
Consul for the second time, and Maximus, 208.
3. The Same Emperors to Maximus.
If your allegations are correct, or Our procurators have unlawfully refused to
hear you with reference to your recovery of the money out of the property of
the surety, which had been placed in the Treasury, but directed you to sue the
principal debtor, since power is given to a creditor to select whichever one he
prefers, as, however, you allege that you obtained two sureties, if one of them
is solvent, you understand that the amount having been divided, you can demand
from Our procurator only half of the debt, and must proceed against the other
surety for the remainder. For although you state that it was mentioned in the
obligation that each of the sureties should be liable in full, still, this
provision, in no respect, changes the requirements and rules of the law, for
even if this had not been added, each of them would still be liable for the
entire indebtedness. Where, however, all of the sureties are solvent, the
obligation shall be divided in proportion to their number.
Published on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof September, during the third
Consulate of Antoninus and Geta, 209.
Extract from Novel 4, Chapter I. Latin Text.
Where, however, both parties are present, the surety cannot be sued before the
principal debtor has been ascertained to be either wholly or in part insolvent.
But when the principal debtor is absent, the surety, if present, can be
proceeded against by law, but the judge is obliged to fix a time within which
the principal debtor must first be sued, holding the surety himself in reserve.
When this time has expired, the surety can be compelled to pay the debt, and
all rights of action should be assigned to him by the creditor without
distinction of contract or suretyship.
4. The Emperor Antoninus to Rufa.
Where a novation has been lawfully made, or the claim transferred to another,
there is no doubt that the sureties or mandators of the first contract will be
released, provided they do not obligate themselves by the last one.
Published on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of
Antoninus, Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
5. The Same Emperors to Potamon.
Under Our law, a creditor is not empowered to bring suit against the sureties
without including the principal debtor, unless it has been proved to have been
otherwise agreed upon by the contracting parties.
6. The Same Emperor to Polla.
If your father did not bind himself for Cornelius when the latter borrowed
money, you are sued to no purpose merely because you signed the contract as a
witness.
Published on the eleventh of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of
Messala and Sabinus, 215.
7. The Same Emperor to Erotus.
If the creditor whom you directed to lend a certain sum of money on your
account did not take pledges as you directed him to do, he has brought an
action of mandate against you in vain, as you understand that you are not
liable unless the obligation was contracted with pledges given as security.
Published on the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Lsetus, Consul for the
second time, and Cerealis, 216.
8. The Emperor Alexander to Longus.
The son under paternal control who became surety for his father even where the
sale of land is involved, is liable.
Published on the second of the Idesof October, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and .^Elianus, 224.
9. The Same Emperor to Aristocrates.
Even if an action has been brought by the creditors for the purpose of selling
the pledges, this does not release the sureties.
Published on the fifth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of
Maximus, Consul for the second time, and -ZElianus, 224.
10. The Same Emperor to Vitalus.
When a surety or a mandator has also obligated himself for the interest, he has
no legal reason for refusing to pay it.
Moreover, one who became surety with another cannot be sued alone, but the
action must be divided among those who are solvent, and this demand must be
made by the defendant surety, in its proper place, before judgment has been
rendered.
11. The Same Emperor to Sallust.
When one of the sureties has paid the entire debt, an action will not lie in
his favor against the other sureties. After you have paid the Treasury, you can
undoubtedly ask that the right to the pledge which the Treasury had shall be
transferred to you, and if this is done, you can avail yourself of any rights
of action which have been assigned.
This rule shall also be observed in the case of private obligations.
Published on the seventh of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of
Alexander, Consul for the third time, and Dio, 230.
12. The Same Emperor to Theodotus.
He flatters you who tells you that you will not be liable for the reason that
when you became security for another you said in Greek
OTWV0<f'A.«s Tro^o-w,1 as it was long since decided that a verbal obligation
can be contracted by words in Greek.

13. Extract from a Letter of the Emperor Gordian to Auxins.
If the decurion stipulated that he would find the robber Barsatoras, he ought
to be compelled to produce him, or give information to the Praetorian Prefect
or the Governor of the province, so that he may be arrested.
14. The Same Emperor to Salivus.
The action of mandate is a personal one, and can be brought in the name of a
surety against either the debtor or his heirs, and the Governor of the province
will order payment to be made of the amount which he may ascertain to be due.
The property pledged by the principal debtor under the terms of the stipulation
must be transferred to you, if the claim has been settled and the rights of
action have been assigned to you. When this has been done, the same illustrious
official will grant you an extraordinary action for the purpose of asserting
your right against the parties in possession of the pledge.
Published on the third of the Nonesof July, during the Consulate of Gordian and
Aviola, 240.
15. The Same Emperor to Claudian.
If you, through mistake, have given security, and, as surety, are compelled to
pay money which you did not owe, you can make use of the exception based on bad
faith, as well as bring a personal action to obtain your release from an
obligation which you did not, in reality, contract.
Moreover, there is no doubt that the surety of a debtor is released, when the
property of the latter has been seized by the Treasury, and suit been brought
against the Treasury for the recovery of the debt, which has been paid.
Published on the fifth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of
Gordian and Aviola.
16. The Same Emperor to Maximus.
A creditor has the right to choose any one of the sureties (provided he does
not consider them all to be solvent) if he makes his selection before suit has
been brought against all of them together, but, after issue has once been
joined, the rule of law does not permit his application for a division to be
granted.

If (as you allege) you did not sell the land hypothecated for the debt at a
fair price, you cannot legally demand that the remaining amount, which you
might have obtained from the sale of the property, shall be refunded to you by
the surety.
Published on the fifth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of
Peregrinus and ^milianus, 245.
19. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Cassars, to Sabinus.
If you have assumed an obligation either as surety or mandator, or in any other
way for a principal debtor, you should be aware that the creditor cannot press
him who borrowed the money any more than he can you, as he has a right to make
his choice, even if this had not been specifically included in the contract.
Ordered on the second of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors.
20. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Aurelian.
The creditor is not deprived of the right of electing to sue any of the
sureties of the principal debtor, even though the latter may have been
convicted of a crime, and all his property confiscated by virtue of a sentence.
21. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Julianus.
As the creditor has a right to sue the sureties instead of the principal
debtor, so it is settled that they cannot be pressed to make payment before the
creditor has assigned to them his right to the property hypothecated, or the
pledges he has received, unless it was agreed that he should do so.
Ordered on the eleventh of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
22. The Same Emperors and Caesars to Hermianus.
If you have agreed to give more than she for whom you have become responsible
as mandator received, the Governor of the province will not suffer any excess
above what was paid on your mandate to be exacted from you.
Ordered on the twelfth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate
of the Csesars.
23. The Same Emperors and C&sars to Antipater.You are allowed to choose any of
the principal debtors or their mandators, and sue them, either for their
proportion, or, if he against
whom you first proceed should not be able to pay the entire amount, you can
afterwards have recourse to another, as none of them should be released by the
selection you have made.
Ordered at Nicomedia, on the Nonesof December, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
24. The Same Emperors and Ctesars to Pergamius.
The heir of a surety is equally liable with the principal debtor, but if he
succeeds to both of them, the obligation of surety becomes extinguished, and he
can only be sued as the heir of the principal debtor.
Ordered on the eleventh of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
25. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Philip.
When pledges given by the principal debtor have been sold by the creditor, the
latter is not forbidden, even after the interval of a long time, to collect the
balance of the claim from the surety.
Ordered on the sixth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
Cassars.
26. The Emperor Justinian to Julian, Prsetorian Prefect.
We order that, if anyone should bind himself under a stipulation for another
that he will produce him at a certain time, or will pay a certain amount of
money for him, and, after the designated period has elapsed, he should not be
able to produce him, and does not immediately tender the money which he agreed
to pay in his behalf, a penal action can certainly be brought against him after
the time has expired, as aforesaid, but the sum of money for which he became
surety need not immediately be collected.
If, however, the time fixed was the term of six months, We order that another
term of the same duration shall be granted the surety within which, if he can
produce the other party and deliver him up, he shall be released from the
penalty. But where the term granted in the beginning consisted of more than six
months, another of equal length should be given, to be reckoned from the
expiration of the first six months (no matter what the original term may have
been), within which he shall have the right to produce the defendant and not
pay the money. If the second term granted should expire without his doing so,
he will then be absolutely required to pay the pecuniary penalty. When, after
the expiration of the first term, the surety wishes to defend the accused
person, he shall be permitted to do so, unless the terms of an agreement
forbade this, and he became surety for him without reserving the right to make
a defence. If, however, he should undertake the defence, he must conduct it to
the end, and permission shall not be given him to deliver up the accused in the
meantime, and evade payment of the money.
After the second term has elapsed, permission shall, under no circumstances
whatever, be granted him to have recourse to a defence,
but he must unquestionably pay the penalty, unless the principal debtor died
during the first term which was granted; for, in this instance, he must be
absolutely released from the exaction of the penalty. If, however, the
defendant should die during the second term, the penalty for which the surety
has become liable shall be exacted; and We decree that, in all cases in which
sureties are subject to penalties of this kind, the rule shall also apply to
their heirs.
Given at Constantinople, on the sixth of the Kalendsof April, during the
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
27. The Same Emperors to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
If the surety did not sign any bond, but merely represented himself as such,
and acknowledged in the presence of notaries that he would be responsible for
the party accused, it was doubted by the Bar of Palestine whether he should not
be released after two months had expired, as his liability had been incurred
without any written instrument executed in conformity with the general edicts
of the tribunal of the Praetor, or whether he could be held liable just as if a
written instrument to that effect had been drawn up.
Another distinction was also introduced, namely, as to whether the same rule of
law should apply to both public and private cases.
Therefore We order that unless a written undertaking has been executed by
sureties for the production of the persons of the parties accused, even though
the acknowledgment of their liability had been made in the presence of
witnesses, still such an acknowledgment ver-.bally made shall not be binding in
private cases; and after two months have elapsed the sureties shall be released
from any obligation of this description unless they bound themselves for a
certain period, for then it should be extended for the time stated in the
presence of witnesses.
But, in public cases, necessity requires that any acknowledgment of this kind
in the presence of witnesses shall, under all circumstances, be considered to
have been committed to writing; for it is not unreasonable that many legaf
privileges have been granted to the people on the ground of public necessity,
and this privilege is hereby confirmed by Us.
Given at Constantinople, on the tenth of the Kalendsof March, after the
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
28. The Same Emperor to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
Generally speaking, We order that what has been decided with reference to
mandators, namely, that where proceedings have been instituted against one the
other shall not be released from liability, shall also be observed with
reference to sureties, for We have ascertained that in the bonds of sureties
provision has, for the most part, been made for this by an agreement.
Hence We order by this general law that through the selection of one of the
sureties, or of the principal debtor, the others shall not be released, nor
will the debtor himself be released where both the sureties, or one of them is
chosen, unless he should satisfy the cred-
itor, but the rights of the latter shall remain unimpaired until the entire sum
of money to which he is entitled has been paid, or his claim is satisfied in
some other way.
We decree that the same rule shall apply where there are two sureties; for We
do not allow the rights of action of creditors against the other surety to be
prejudiced, where one of them has been selected, but they shall remain intact,
whether they are based on personal or hypothecary actions, until the claim has
been completely satisfied. For as this is permitted to be done under the terms
of agreements, and We see that it takes place every day in practice, so, for
this reason, it is not conceded by the authority of this law, that the
inadvertence of those who make contracts should, on any ground whatsoever, be
able to impair the rights of the creditor.
Given at Constantinople, on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof November, after the
fifth Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
TITLE XLII.
CONCERNING NOVATIONS AND ASSIGNMENTS.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Timothy.
The assignment of a debt, made under a stipulation, cannot be effected unless
with the consent and approval of the debtor, but the sale of the claim can be
made without the knowledge or acquiescence of the person against whom the
actions at law are directed.

An action arising from a contract for the loan of money is brought to no
purpose, where a delegation of the person has been properly made as the former
contract is extinguished by the right of novation.
Published on the Kalends ofSeptembeY, during the Consulate of Pius and
Pontianus, 239.
3. The Same Emperor to Mutmnus.
If the delegation of your debtor did not take place, and on this account you
have retained your rights of action, even though you may have assigned them to
your creditor against your debtor, in order to obtain payment, still, before
the case is brought to trial, or your creditor has collected any of the debt,
or has served notice on your debtor, you will not be prevented from exacting
the amount due from your debtor, and in this way prevent your creditor from
doing so.
Where, however, an assignment has been made of your rights of action, you will
be released by the novation, and will have no reason to apprehend that your
creditor will not collect the debt, because the party in question is his
client, as you were released from liability for it through the novation having
been confirmed by the verbal obligation.
Published on the fifth of the Idesof June, during the Consulate of Gordian and
Aviola, 240.
4. The Same Emperor to Stratonicus.
Your attorney did not deprive you of your right of action, if, when you
commissioned him to collect the money which the parties against whom you have
filed your petition owed you, and he, having accepted a part of the debt,
released them from payment of the remainder, as he had no right to make a
novation without your consent, nor could he release them from liability for
what they did not pay.

5. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Septimia.
If your father, whom you say that you have succeeded, promised by a stipulation
to pay a certain sum of money to the creditor, and receive from him in return a
claim on Alexander, who was indebted to him, although Alexander dishonestly
refused to pay him, still, it would be dishonorable for you to refuse payment
of the amount promised by your father.

If Eucarpus, having been assigned, promised to pay you a sum of money, or has
acknowledged the debt, he can be sued in his own name, otherwise you will gain
nothing by proceeding against him in the name of your debtor, who was bound by
a written obligation.
Ordered on the seventh of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
8. The Emperor Justinian to the Senate.
We, desiring to amend the harmful rules which apply to novations, and to
dispose of the ambiguities of the ancient law, do hereby order that, if anyone
should offer another person, or change any one of those who are liable, or
accept a pledge, or diminish or increase the amount of the obligation, or
extend or shorten the time specified, or accept security of a later date, or
perform any of those acts by which, in the opinion of the ancient legal
authorities, novations were created, no change whatever will thereby be made in
the former claim, but every provision made in the first place will stand, and
anything subsequently done will be considered as supplementary to the same,
unless it plainly cancelled the former obligation, and expressly stated that
the second one should take the place of that previously made.
And, generally speaking, We decree that novation is effected rather by the
intention than by law, and if it is not stated in so many words
that there should be no innovation (which is ordinarily indicated in Greek by
the expression avm xa^°TriT0^),it shall not take place; for We wish novations
to be created in the course of business transactions, and not merely through
the utterance of words which have no connection with them.
Given at Constantinople, on the eleventh of the Kalendsof August, during the
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
TITLE XLIII. CONCERNING PAYMENTS AND RELEASES.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Aristenetus.
He who owes money on several debts to the same creditor has the right, at the
time of payment, to state upon which one the money shall be credited. If the
debtor does not do this, he who receives the money shall have the choice of
applying the amount to whichever claim he pleases. If neither one of them
should express his wishes in this respect, the sum paid shall first be applied
to the interest, and afterwards to the principal.
Published on the second of the Nonesof November, during the Consulate of the
two Aspers, 213.
2. The Emperor Alexander to Basso,.
It is unquestionably the law that sureties are released whenever the Treasury
succeeds (even under different rights) the creditor or the debtor. My
procurators will see that this rule is observed so far as you personally are
concerned.
Published on the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Lupus and Maximus,
233.
3. The Emperor Gordian to Apollonius.
If you borrowed money from a slave who had the free administration of his
peculium,and you paid the debt before he was deprived of his peculium,or before
you were aware that this had been done, you will be released from liability for
payment.
Published on the fifth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of Pius
and Pontianus, 239.
4. The Same Emperor to Rufina.
It makes no difference whether you have paid the money which you have borrowed
to your creditor himself, or with his consent to his slave, for although the
creditor may have died before the slave rendered an account of the payment, the
force of an extinguished obligation cannot be renewed.
Published on the second of the Idesof October, during the Consulate of Pius and
Pontianus, 239.
5. The Same Emperor to Celsus.
You have no right of action against another creditor on the ground that, having
tendered him the amount of the debt, you desired his
obligation to be transferred to you, as you do not state that you purchased the
claim from him, although where payment is made by another in the name of the
debtor, the obligation is ordinarily extinguished.
Published on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof November, during
the Consulate of Pius and Pontianus, 239.
6. The Same Emperor to Alexander.
If a compromise was made between your father and those whom you allege to have
been his debtors, and this was not done with reference to a lawsuit, the issue
of which was doubtful, and your father only received a part of the debt, but
acknowledged that he had received it all, he did not (having given a receipt or
made a donation) by doing so release those who had verbally bound themselves
for the payment of the balance, and his right to the recovery of the remainder
of the debt remains unimpaired.
Published on the third of the Idesof February, during the Consulate of Gordian
and Aviola, 240.
7. The Emperor Philip and the Caesar Philip to Antiochus.
It is clear that interest cannot be claimed on that part of a debt the right to
which has been extinguished by set-off.
Published on the fifth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of
Peregrinus and .^Emilianus, 245.
8. The Same Emperor and Csesar to Rufus.
The rule of practice does not permit the annual payment of interest, which was
agreed to be made in a certain city, to be paid elsewhere, unless some good
reason exists for this being done.
Published on the fifth of the Idesof May, during the Consulate of Philip and
Titian, 246.
9. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Cassius.
It is clear that a release from liability for a debt takes place where the
entire sum of money due is sealed up and deposited, in accordance with the
legal formalities required, but in order for the tender of the amount of the
debt to effect a release of liability, it should be made in the same place
where the money is due.
Published on the fifth of the Idesof May, during the Consulate of Maximus and
Acquilinus, 286.
10. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Ambrosius.It is settled that the heirs of
one who, being over twenty-five years of age, legally gave certain slaves in
satisfaction of a debt, cannot
claim them.
Ordered at Byzantium, on the fifth of the Idesof April, during the
Consulate of the above-mentioned Emperors.
11. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Capitolina.
If your husband received a certain sum of money from your debtors on account of
an obligation due to you, and you were under the age
of twenty-five years, and did not give your consent to the transaction, your
rights will not be prejudiced to any extent, unless after you attained your
majority you ratified the payment which was made.
Ordered at Heraclia, on the fifth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of
the above-mentioned Emperors.
12. The Same Emperors and Cassars to Euty chins.
Anyone who pays a debt to a third party without the consent or knowledge of his
creditor does not release himself from the obligation. Where, however, this was
done by the direction of the creditor, or if he afterwards ratified the payment
which was made, the debtor will be entitled to a release, just as if he had
paid the creditor himself.
Ordered on the third of the Idesof May, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors.
13. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Philotimus.
If, by means of a receipt, and not by a novation made under a stipulation, you
released a man who was bound under the terms of a mandate, and you erroneously
stated in writing that you had received the entire sum to which you were
entitled, the obligation will not be extinguished by this appearance of the
truth.
Ordered on the sixth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors.
14. The Same Emperors and Cassars to Cohorta.
The acknowledgment of money paid, by means of an instrument in writing, is
better proof of the transaction than where the documentary evidence of the loan
which was made has been returned.
Ordered on the fifth of the Idesof July, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors.
15. The Same Emperors and Cassars to Quartinus.
Your rights are in no way affected for the reason that (as you allege) the
evidence of the debt was returned to your debtor. Therefore, if you can legally
prove the existence of this obligation by any evidence whatsoever, the judge
will compel the payment of the debt which is legally due by the debtor who did
not obtain a release from liability by an act of this kind.
Ordered on the fifth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
16. The Same Emperors and Cassars to Charidemus.
The rule of law does not permit him from whom you have borrowed money to
accept, against his will, an obligation due from your debtor.
Extract from Novel 73, Chapter II. Latin Text.
This rule is not applicable unless the debtor is unable to discharge the debt,
either by the payment of money, or by the transfer of other property; for, in
this instance, the best real estate which the debtor
possesses can be conveyed in satisfaction of the debt, after an exact estimate
has been made by the court, in order that the debtor may be permitted to make
payment with said property, and the creditor to demand it, the debtor being
compelled to furnish the creditor with the best security against eviction that
he can possibly obtain, which applies to all actions at law.
Where, however, the creditor is ready to provide a purchaser, the debtor, after
having furnished security to the creditor, with the approval of the court, will
be required to sell the property, and satisfy the claim of the creditor with
the proceeds of the same.
17. The Same Emperors and Cassars to Cassius.
It is a clear rule of law that an obligation is extinguished just as much
through payment by another party for the debtor, as where with the consent of
the creditor himself property is transferred to him instead of payment being
made of the money which is due.
Ordered at Sirmium, on the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
18. The Same Emperors and Cassars to Domitius.
An inquiry into the truth cannot be prevented for the reason that you allege
that the papers drawn up by your attorney were received, and restored to you by
his heir, with the statement of your attorney to the effect that nothing is due
to the creditors, as it is possible that the said creditors have been satisfied
by payment, not with your money, but with that of him whom you directed to
transact the business.
Ordered on the Idesof February, during the Consulate of the Caesars.
19. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Diogenes.
If you have paid your creditor the money you borrowed through her slave, acting
as her agent, and appointed by her to collect her debts, no loss can result to
you if the receipt for the same is found to be void. It would be otherwise,
however, if you had paid a slave not authorized to receive the money, and you
would not be released from liability to an action brought by his mistress.
Ordered on the fifth of the Idesof October, during the Consulate
of the Csesars.
20. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Eucrates.
When a creditor has consented to accept the services of a certain slave in
payment for money loaned, after the terms of the agreement have been complied
with, its provision with reference to the return of the slave should be
observed.
Ordered at Adrianople, on the fifth of the Kalendsof November, during the
Consulate of the Cajsars.
21. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Rufus.It makes a great deal of difference
whether, in the hope of future payment, you stated that you had received the
amount mentioned in
the rescript, or whether you accepted, by way of compromise, a smaller sum than
you were entitled to, and was stated in the receipt; for in the former
instance, the right to collect the balance remains unimpaired, but in the
latter, it is proper that the compromise made by common consent should stand.
Ordered on the third of the Nonesof December, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
22. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Grains.
It is of no consequence whether or not your note was erased, that is to say,
cancelled, if you can prove that payment of the debt was once made to him who
had the right to collect the same.
Ordered on the fifth of the Idesof December, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
23. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Vacius.
Where Auxenon sent a letter to Aristo, directing him to pay you a sum of money,
which he owed to him, and you wrote in reply that you had received the amount
of the debt from Aristo, without the mandate having yet been complied with, the
right to collect the debt remains unimpaired, and nothing can prevent its
recovery by law.
Ordered at Nicomedia, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the
Consulate of the Cassars.
24. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Rufinus.
As you acknowledge that you have, as provided by the agreement, transferred the
land in question to Evander in satisfaction of the money which you borrowed
from him, you cannot legally claim that he is liable to you for the results of
his industry, or for any profit derived from some accidental circumstance; for
if the land should depreciate in value, you would certainly not ask to be
permitted to share the loss.
Ordered at Nicomedia, on the seventh of the Kalendsof January, during the
Consulate of the Caesars.
25. The Same Emperors and Csesars to AureUan.
The burden of proof of payment lies upon the party making the allegation, and
when this is done, you can bring suit for the recovery of the note.
Ordered at Nicomedia, on the third of the Kalendsof January, during the
Consulate of the Csesars.
TITLE XLIV.
CONCERNING VERBAL RELEASES. 1. The Emperor Antoninus to Apronius.
I have already written to you that you can inquire of the judge whether your
sister released her debtor by the authority of her guard-
ian, and in compliance with the ordinary formalities. Therefore, if the adverse
party continues to demand a debt which was paid, you can use the proper means
to defend yourself.
Published on the third of the Idesof February, during the Consulate of the two
Aspers, 213.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Clams.
If, by giving him a receipt, you released your debtor on account of a novation
made by means of a gift, you are deprived of every cause
of action.
Ordered on the sixth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors and Cassars.
3. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Demetria.
When both the obligation and the receipt have been extinguished by the Aquilian
stipulation, under an agreement, he who has no good cause for restitution is
precluded from any further legal action.
Ordered on the fifth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
TITLE XLV. CONCERNING EVICTIONS.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Munitius.
The purchaser of an estate can, at his own risk and expense, recover property
belonging to it from those in possession. For it is settled that when an estate
has been legally sold, eviction is not guaranteed with reference to individual
articles of property composing the said estate, unless an express agreement to
that effect has been made between the contracting parties.
Published on the sixth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Severus,
Consul for the third time, and Victorinus, 201.
2. The Same Emperors to Quarta.
If, when your grandfather gave you the land in question, he guaranteed you
against eviction of the same, you can proceed against your co-heirs under the
terms of the stipulation, on account of the eviction of the land aforesaid,
that is to say, in proportion of the interest of each of them in the estate. It
is certain, however, that if the donor had only made a mere agreement without
consideration concerning said eviction, he would not be bound by it.
Published on the second of the Kalendsof March, during the second Consulate of
Antoninus and Geta, 206.
3. The Same Emperors to Aurelian.
Anyone who purchases property, and afterwards obtains possession of it, cannot,
as long as he is not evicted, bring suit against the
vendor on the ground that he is said to have sold him property which belonged
to another, or was encumbered.
Published on the eighth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of
Faustinus and Rufinus, 311.
4. The Emperor Antoninus to Georgius.
If land has been transferred to you in satisfaction of a debt, and it was
previously hypothecated to other creditors, the condition of the encumbrance is
not altered. Therefore, if you should be evicted on this account, a praetorian
action will lie in your favor against the debtor, for a contract of this kind
resembles one of sale.
Published on the eleventh of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of the
two Aspers, 213.
5. The Same Emperor to Patronia.
If, among the lands which you have purchased, one tract, encumbered by the
vendor, has not yet been transferred to you, you can bring suit on the ground
of purchase to compel its release by the creditor. The result will be the same
if you should plead an exception based on fraud against the vendor, after he
has brought an action on sale to recover the price of the land.
Published on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of
the two Aspers, 213.
6. The Emperor Alexander to Octavius.
There is no doubt that if the vendor did not expressly guarantee you against
eviction, an action of purchase will lie, if eviction should take place.
Published on the eighth of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Alexander,
223.
7. The Same Emperor to Hilarian.
There is no doubt that when the property is evicted, and satisfaction cannot be
obtained from the vendor, suit can be brought against his surety because of the
eviction, even if he was not aware that it had taken place.
Published on the third of the Nonesof April, during the Consulate of Alexander,
223.
8. The Same Emperor to Clementinus.
If the purchaser of land should be evicted, he will have no right of action
under a stipulation, or for double damages, or of purchase, against either the
vendor or his surety, unless he has previously served notice on the vendor or
his heir. But where the purchaser does not appear in court, or has judgment
unjustly rendered against him during the absence of the vendor or his surety,
he will have no recourse against them afterwards.
Published on the eighth of the Idesof December, during the Consulate of
Alexander, 223.
9. The Same Emperor to Terentius.
Where a controversy is raised by anyone with reference to land which you state
you purchased in good faith, notify the vendor or his heir, and if you gain the
case, you will have what you purchased. If, however, you should be evicted, you
can recover damages from the vendor, or his heir, and the expenses incurred by
you in the improvement of the property which you purchased will also be
included.
Published on the eleventh of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Alexander, 223.
10. The Same Emperor to Largus.
If the vendor established the boundaries of the land, and fixed a limit which
no one should pass, and any of the said land should be evicted, it will be at
the risk of the vendor. Hence, if he sold the land with the boundaries which he
himself established, the expense of any litigation with reference to them must
be borne by him.
Published on the seventh of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of
Maximus, Consul for the second time, and JElianus, 224.
11. The Same Emperor to Clement.
He whom you accepted as surety for your vendor can be legally barred by an
exception on the ground of fraud if he raises a controversy in his own name,
stating that he, through the agency of his wife, purchased the land in question
before you did, as he gave his consent to the sale, and by so doing, rendered
himself responsible for eviction.
Published on the Nonesof February, during the Consulate of Pompeianus and
Pelignus, 232.
12. The Emperor Gordian to Philip.
If a slave whom you purchased should obtain his freedom, and it was agreed when
you bought him that if any question should arise on this point, even if he was
not yet evicted, you could recover the price you paid for him, the Governor of
the province, after having ascertained that the price should be refunded to
you, will order this to be done.
Published on the seventh of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Gordian
and Aviola, 240.
13. The Same Emperor to Zoilus.
When, as the result of a judicial decision, pledges have been seized by the
authority of the judge having jurisdiction of the case, and you purchased those
you mention, your right to the same will be questioned to no purpose by the
party against whom judgment was rendered, or his heir, as it has very properly
been held that where eviction of property is obtained by anyone else, an action
should be granted against those who had the benefit of the price.
Published on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of
Gordian and Aviola, 240.
14. The Same Emperor to Secundinus.
Whether the possession of the land belonging to the vendor and his son and heir
ineffectually raises a question as to its ownership, or whether it did not
belong to the father, but to the son himself, who can claim it by hereditary
right, he cannot bring about a controversy with reference to the title.
Published on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of
Gordian and Aviola, 240.
15. The Emperor Philip to Menander.
If you lost your case, not through the injustice of the judge, but in
consequence of the application of a legal principle, you can formally establish
your right to the property pledged as a guarantee against eviction.
Published on the Kalendsof August, ....
16. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Alexander and Diogenes.
The Governor of the province will examine the question of the purchase of the
land, and if he should ascertain that a portion of the same belongs to the
adverse party, he will order that the expenses, which it is proved you have
incurred in improving the property, be refunded to you, after an account has
been rendered of the profits. The vendor, however, should be sued for the price
of the part which was evicted, and not he who actually evicted the ownership of
the premises.
Published on the tenth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of
Diocletian, Consul for the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third
time, 290.
17. The Same Emperors to Mutianus.
If, when a question arose with reference to a slave whom you purchased, you
notified the vendor of this fact, and did not surrender the said slave until
after a judicial decision had been rendered against you, the Governor of the
province will, in accordance with law, fix the amount of the damage which you
allege you have sustained.
Published on the fifth of the Idesof November, during the Consulate of
Diocletian, Consul for the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third
time, 290.
18. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Eutychius.
When a question arises with reference to the status of a slave who was sold to
you, and, after you have complied with the formalities prescribed by law, the
decision should be in favor of his freedom, and you purchased him while
ignorant of his condition, you can, without any doubt, proceed on the ground of
eviction against the vendor, his sureties, or their heirs. If the decision
should declare him to be a slave, you understand that you will have no recourse
against the vendor.
19. The Same Emperors and Caesars to Theodore.
If you sold the land which was encumbered, and the purchasers were able to
protect themselves by the ordinary prescription of long time, you need not fear
the danger of eviction.
Ordered on the second of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors.
20. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Solidus and Others.
If your parents sold certain slaves, and the question of their ownership was
raised against the purchasers, you will not be prevented from appearing and
defending the case.
Where, however, the slaves have already been evicted, and you did not take an
appeal, your demand that the case should be revived is, so far as you are
concerned, contrary to law. If an action on the ground of eviction is brought
against you, and it is proved that notice was given to enable you to make a
defence, you are aware to what extent you can protect yourselves.
Ordered on the sixth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate
of the above-mentioned Emperors.
21. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Heliodorus.
The action of purchase is not barred by the prescription of long time even
though it should be proved that a very extended period has elapsed since the
eviction of the property. Therefore if the slave, whom you state you purchased,
is now proclaimed to be free, you should summon the vendor or his heir, in
order that they may assist you in conducting the suit. If, however, it should
have been decided that the man was free, and not a slave, and it is proved that
you were not released from the risk of eviction, the Governor of the province
(if the case has not been heard) will see that you are indemnified.
Ordered on the eleventh of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
22. The Same Emperors and Caesars to Julius.As you allege that the land was
sold to you by the vendor as being unencumbered, but it was not, and you paid
the amount of a former obligation which was due, it is clear that the
stipulation which you say provided for your indemnity with reference to the
property sold should be carried into effect.
Ordered on the seventh of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
23. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Eustochia.As the heirs of a vendor can be
held liable in case of eviction, if the City of Thessalonica attempts to obtain
by law the property which you purchased on the ground that it was pledged to
it, notify the heirs of the vendor, no matter in what degree they may be, to
assist in the conduct of the case. Whether they were present or absent at the
time of the eviction of the land which was purchased, it is a well-
known fact that they will be liable to the extent ofyour interest in not having
it evicted, and not for the amount of the price which you paid, unless it was
otherwise agreed.
Ordered at Sirmium, on the second of the Kalends ofJanuary, during the
Consulate of the above-mentioned Emperors.
24. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Eutychius.
If a question should arise as to the title of the property disposed of, after
the sale has been concluded, but before the price was paid, or the slaves who
were sold have been declared to be free (as in this instance), the eviction
relates back to the beginning of the contract, and it is declared by the
authority of the law that if the purchaser is not offered enough to satisfy his
claim, he cannot be compelled to pay the balance of the price. Therefore, after
a part of the price has been paid, as you allege that you were notified by
another person not to complete the purchase, as the house which you bought was
pledged to him, the judge will see that you are paid what you are legally
entitled to under the contract of sale.
Ordered at Sirmium, on the sixth of the Kalendsof February, during the
Consulate of the Csesars.
25. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Saturnina.
If Saturninus sold you a female slave of whose condition he was ignorant, who
now maintains that she is free, and she should be decided to be free, you can
sue the vendor for double damages under the stipulation; or you can proceed by
an action on purchase against him for the damage which you may have sustained.
Ordered on the Idesof February, during the Consulate of the abovementioned
Emperors.
26. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Neo.
If anyone sold you a slave who afterwards died, the vendor cannot be sued by
you, as your risk of eviction is at an end.
Ordered at Sirmium, on the second of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate
of the Caesars.
27. The Same Emperors and Caesars to Theophilus.
If Athenocles purchased land belonging to another, knowing that this was the
case, or that it was encumbered, he cannot bring suit on the ground of
eviction, because, contrary to the rules of law, he claims that he paid a
consideration. If, however, he was ignorant of the facts, the law does not
oppose your demand that the purchase money should be refunded.
Ordered on the fifteenth of the Kalends ofOctober, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
28. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Maximian and Others.There is no doubt that
the rights of the vendor can be exercised by the purchaser. Therefore, if your
right to the ownership of the
property is questioned, you can avail yourself of the same means of defence as
the vendor could make use of.
Ordered on the third of the Nonesof October, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
29. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Rhesus.
If your mother gave the curators of your brother certain lands in exchange for
others, and afterwards they were notified to defend the title, or were evicted
when they did not have power to make a defence; it is reasonable that you
should have a right to sue them for damages.
Ordered at Nicomedia, during the Ides ofDecember, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
30. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Hastius.
He who purchased a slave from your mother cannot be presumed to have had
knowledge that he belonged to another, by the mere fact that he stipulated for
double damages in case of eviction, nor will his reputation suffer and he be
considered a fraudulent purchaser on this account. You can, however, prove this
by other evidence, if you desire
to do so.
Ordered on the Idesof December, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
31. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Agatho.
The heir of the surety for the property on account of which the deceased
rendered himself liable to the purchaser is not prevented from claiming the
ownership of it in his own name, that is to say, while the action for eviction
is still pending.
Ordered on the eighteenth of the Kalends ofJanuary, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
TITLE XLVI. A CREDITOR is NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR EVICTION.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Publicius.
As My procurator sold the land referred to by the right of a creditor, on
account of debts due to the Treasury, he is not liable for eviction, and a
private creditor enjoys the same advantage, unless this was expressly renounced
by him.
Where, however, the Treasury succeeded to the rights of another creditor, the
title of the purchaser cannot legally be disputed in the name of the Treasury,
whether his claim was preferred when he sold the property, or whether it was
not, as he who sells property which is pledged must prove that his claim is
prior to that of all other creditors.
Published on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of
Maximus, Consul for the second time, and ^llianus, 224.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Sabina.
If your father purchased from a creditor lands which were encumbered by the
right of pledge, and they are evicted, you have a right of action against the
vendor, if at the time she sold them she guaranteed the title in case of
eviction, or you can bring suit on the ground of fraud, if she knew that the
title to the property was defective, and sold it to your father, whom you
succeeded as heir. For as a contract of this kind does not, in case of
eviction, bind a creditor who is ignorant of the facts, so it does not release
one who commits a fraud, or is guilty of deception.
Published on the seventh of the Idesof April, during the Consulate of Sabinus,
Consul for the second time, and Venustus, 241.
TITLE XLVII. CONCERNING PATERNAL CONTROL.
1. The Emperors Antoninus and Verus to Titius.
If you allege that your son is under your control, the Governor of the province
will determine whether he ought to hear you, as you have for a long time
permitted his affairs to be transacted as those of the head of a family, by the

3. The Emperor Alexander to Artemidorus.
While your son is under your control, he cannot alienate any property which he
has acquired for you. If he should not show you the respect due to a father,
you will not be prevented from punishing him by the right of paternal
authority, and you can use even a harsher remedy if he should persevere in his
obstinacy, for having brought him before the Governor of the province, the
latter will impose the sentence which you desire.
Published on the sixth of the Idesof December, during the Consulate of Albinus
and Maximus, 228.
4. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus to Cola.
It seems to be more proper for the disputes which have arisen between you and
your children to be settled at home. If, however, the matter is of such a
nature that you deem it necessary to have recourse to the law in order to
punish them for the wrong which they have inflicted upon you, the Governor of
the province, if applied to, will order what is usually prescribed by law with
reference to pecuniary disputes, and will compel your children to show you the
respect which is
due to their mother, and if he should ascertain that their disgraceful conduct
has proceeded to the extent of serious injury, he will severely punish their
want of filial affection.

9. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Niconagoras.
The Decrees of the Senate enacted with reference to the acknowledgment of
offspring clearly set forth that no one can deny his child, as is shown by the
penalty prescribed, as well as the prejudicial action authorized by the
Perpetual Edict, and the fact that support can be demanded before the Governor
by a child over three years of age, if applied for in its own name.
Ordered at Sirmium, on the fifth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of
the Csesars.
10. The Emperor Constantine to Maximus, Prefect of the City.
Such importance was attached to liberty by our ancestors that fathers, who in
former times had the right of life and death over their children, were not
permitted to deprive them of their freedom.

2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Ctesars, to Timothy.
If the blood-relatives of the child under the age of puberty, whom you desire
to arrogate as your natural son, consent to this before the Governor of the
province, you can have him as your son, but a fourth part of your estate must
be left to him by your last will or given to him by you at the time of his
emancipation, and security with reference to his patrimony shall be provided
with proper sureties in the presence of a public official, in order that you
may not, under the pretext of adoption, seize his property, which should be
diligently preserved by you for his benefit.
Arrogation granted by the indulgence of the Emperor, and carried out before the
Praetor or the Governor, has the same validity that it formerly had when, under
the ancient law, it took place in the presence of the people.

Consul for the second time, and Aquilinus, 286.
3. The Same Emperors to Martianus.
As you state that the person whom you desire to arrogate is your freedman, and
you do not set forth in your petition any good cause for doing so, that is to
say, that you take this step for the reason that you have no children, you are
advised that the authority of the law refuses your request.

Maximus and Aquilinus, 286.

Consul for the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third time, 290.
5. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Syra.
It is certain that a woman cannot arrogate, as she cannot have children under
her control. However, as you desire the privilege of
having your stepson take the place of your lawful offspring, as a consolation
for the children whom you have lost, We grant your request in conformity with
what We have already provided on this point, and hence We permit you to have
your stepson occupy the position of your natural and legitimate son just as if
he had been born to you.

Tiberianus and Dio, 291.

Emperor.
Published at Byzantium, on the sixth of the Nonesof April, during the Consulate
of the Csesars.
7. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Atticus.
Anyone who has legally been given in adoption to the resident of another town
than that in which he resides does not thereby change his citizenship, and
therefore you will see that your right to obtain public honors and offices in
your birthplace and your duty to discharge them is not affected by adoption.
Ordered at Sirmium, on the eleventh of the Kalendsof February, during the
Consulate of the Csesars.
8. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Isio.
The patron of a mother is not forbidden to adopt the daughter of the latter,
when the father, under whose control she is, gives her in adoption. The
arrogation of a woman who is her own mistress, however, can never take place,
except by virtue of an Imperial Rescript.
Ordered on the fifth of the Idesof February, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
9. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Marinus.
An adoptive father is not forbidden to remove his adopted son from his family
by the solemn act of emancipation, even when the adoption was granted by Our
indulgence.
10. The Emperor Justinian to Julian, Prsetorian Prefect.
A doubt arose among legal authorities in ancient times with reference to
children who are under the control of their fathers, being given in adoption by
the latter to others, whether a child of this kind, if it was passed over by
its natural father, would have a right of action against his estate on the
ground of the will being inofficious. Papinianus denies him this right of
action; Paulus failed to give an opinion on this point; but Martianus made a
distinction, and, in order that the child might not lose the estate of both
fathers, he held that it would be entitled to the estate if it had not been
mentioned in the will of its natural father, and its adoptive father was poor.
Another inconvenience arises in a case of this kind, for if, after the death of
the natural father, the adoptive father should relinquish
his right of adoption by means of emancipation, the adopted child would have no
hope, as it could not attack the will of its natural father for the reason that
at the time of the death of the latter it belonged to another family; nor could
it attack that of its adoptive father because it had been removed from his
family by emancipation; and therefore, for the purpose of disposing of this
doubt, and correcting this defect, We decree that where an adoption of a
strange person is made, the rights of the natural father are, by no means,
lost, but he still retains them, just as if his son had not been transferred to
another family. For the tie of adoption is so fragile that a person can become
a son and a stranger through emancipation, upon the same day. And who would
suffer the rights of a natural father, created by the bond of nature, to be
lost by this species of mockery ? In this instance, permission is given to the
son by the ancient law to oppose his adoption, and he cannot be compelled to
pass into another family without his consent.
Therefore, as We have already stated with reference to the transfer of a son to
a strange father by adoption, the rights of said son remain unimpaired, so far
as an action to declare a will inofficious is concerned, as well as with
reference to all other successions which are transmitted to children either as
heirs at law, or by testamentary provisions, so that he himself can both be a
source of profit to his natural father, and be entitled to what is due to him
from the latter. If, however, his natural father should have given him in
adoption to his maternal or paternal grandfather, or if he himself, having been
emancipated, should, in like manner, have given his son in adoption to either
his maternal or paternal great-grandfather, for the reason that, in this
instance, the rights of nature and adoption are combined in one and the same
person, the right of the adoptive father will stand, and be joined to the
natural tie by legitimate adoption, and the son will only consider who is
connected with him by nature, and to whom the law has assigned him by adoption.
Under such circumstances, the opinion of Papinianus shall prevail, and the
adoptive son can direct all his hopes towards his adoptive father, and will not
be permitted to interfere with the estate of his natural father, and he must
manifest filial respect only for his grandfather or great-grandfather, and
acquire for him whatever property can be so acquired, and exist for his
benefit, and he alone shall be considered his father whom the law created, and
whom Nature did not reject.
We do not find that the distinction of Martianus is applicable in this case,
where no suspicion of fraud can be said to exist, as the affection of a
grandfather or a great-grandfather does not permit any such suspicion to arise,
and all matters shall remain as they are, unless the grandfather or great-
grandfather should emancipate his adopted son; for then it will be necessary
for him again to be brought under the authority of his natural father, as the
adoption of any one is annulled by means of emancipation.
(1) But in order that We may not leave the question of the adoption of a
strange person unregulated by law, We grant permission to
an adoptive father of this kind, that is to say, to a stranger, to leave his
adoptive son nothing by his will, if he should desire to do so; but if he does
leave him anything, it shall be considered as due to his generosity, and not
because he was legally required to do so. For as We have preserved for the son
everything to which he is entitled by natural law, it is perfectly clear that
all property which, in accordance with Our enactments, can come into the hands
of the son of a family, will be acquired, not by the strange adoptive father,
but by the natural father, so far as the usufruct of the same is concerned, and
shall belong to him as having been acquired by a fictitious and recent
affection, and not through the diminution of his former blood-relationship.
Where, however, the son remains permanently adopted in this way, without being
emancipated, We desire that the only benefit accruing to him .from the adoption
shall be that he cannot be defrauded out of the succession of his adoptive
father if the latter should die intestate, but shall have the advantage of
acquiring the property of his natural father by will. For according to the
ancient laws, the bond of relationship which connected the son with his natural
father was not dissolved by adoption, but the rights which accrued to him under
it were added to certain others, which he retained under natural law, and he
who was legally a member of the adoptive family remained a blood-relative of
the natural family. For what authority can abolish maternal rights when, even
according to the ancient law, the child had an adoptive father, but no other
mother than the one whom nature
had given him?
Therefore, We order that a child of this kind shall preserve his natural rights
unimpaired, still, if a stranger, who is his adoptive father, should die
without making a will, he will only be entitled to his estate as a proper heir,
and will have no other lawful rights with respect to the family of his adoptive
father and nothing in common with it, but will be considered a stranger, so far
as the said family is
concerned.
(2) When, however, all adoptive rights are extinguished by emancipation, then
there can be absolutely no claim advanced to the estate of the adoptive father,
if he is a stranger, even though he should die intestate; but the son shall
only recognize his natural father, just as if he had not been in the first
place transferred by adoption.
(3) Moreover, the rules which We have established with reference to other
adoptions, We also prescribe concerning those made ex tribus maribus,by
strangers under the Sabinian Decree of the Senate, for absolutely no difference
should exist between those and other adoptions.
(4) What We have already stated concerning a son given in adoption by his
father also applies to a daughter, a grandson, and a granddaughter, and We
extend the rule to include their descendants of both sexes who are under
paternal control; provided, at the death of their grandfather, they do not
again come under the authority of their father, for if they should do so (when
the grandfather is not
required to leave anything to his grandson or granddaughter), all the rights
relating to adoption remain unimpaired, so far as the child is concerned.
All the provisions of this law which apply to sons, daughters, grandsons,
granddaughters and their descendants who are under paternal control, have been
introduced to remove any doubt as to what should be decided where there are two
fathers of one child, one bestowed by nature, and the other appointed by law.
(5) Where a man, who is his own master, gives himself in adoption by Imperial
authority, he still retains intact all his filial rights with respect to his
adoptive father, for, in this instance, no distinction exists between the two
fathers, as when an adopted son becomes the heir of his father (who is the
arrogator) he is added to his family, and all the provisions which the ancient
legislators introduced with reference to an arrogated son remain intact and
unimpaired.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalends ofSeptember, during the fifth Consulate
of Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
11. The Same Emperor to Julian, Praetorian Prefect.
We, desiring to amend, or rather to abolish the ancient technicalities
generally employed in adoptions, and by means of which three emancipations and
two manumissions usually took place in the case of sons, and a single
emancipation in the case of daughters and other descendants, decree that a
father who desires to give children, who are under his control, in adoption,
shall be permitted to do so without observing the old formalities connected
with emancipations and manumissions, by appearing before a competent judge, and
complying with the ordinary legal requirements, the person making the adoption
as well as the one adopted both being present, provided the latter does not
withhold his consent.

fifth Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
TITLE XLIX. CONCERNING THE EMANCIPATION OF CHILDREN.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Herennius.

the act of your father is valid.

3. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Heliodorus.
Children are not released from paternal authority by mere consent, but by a
formal proceeding or an accident, and inquiry is not made as to the motives
which may have induced the father to emancipate his son, but whether the legal
formalities were observed.
Ordered on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
4. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Colona,.
Agrandfather cannot be compelled to release his granddaughter from his
authority, and it is not Our custom to confer a benefit to another's injury.
Given on the Idesof October, ....
5. The Emperor Anastasius to Constantine, Prsetorian Prefect.
We order that ascendants, that is to say a father, a paternal grandfather or
great-grandfather, and other persons of the male sex in degrees further
removed, shall have permission to emancipate children who are under their
control, namely: their sons or daughters, grandsons or granddaughters by their
sons; great-grandsons or great-granddaughters, and all other persons of both
sexes connected with them in the direct descending line, whether they are
absent and away on a journey, or whether they reside in the same places,
provinces, or cities, even if they are not present in court at the time that
they desire to render them independent; and, under such circumstances, they
should petition for a rescript which shall be recorded and deposited with a
competent magistrate having jurisdiction of emancipation proceedings; and after
this has been done and the deposit and registry made in accordance with the
prayer of the petition, under the authority granted by the rescript, the
emancipation shall obtain full force, and the persons entitled to this benefit
shall be released from the control of others, just as if they had been
emancipated by their parents; provided, however, the said persons have agreed
to the emancipation as proposed by their fathers, and this has been provided by
the testimony of witnesses, in presence of the same judge or any other
whomsoever, either before the petition was filed and the rescript issued, or
afterwards, unless they are infants, who become their own masters in this way
without their consent.
Given at Constantinople, on the eleventh of the Kalendsof August, during the
Consulate of Probus and Avienus Junior, 503.
6. The Emperor Justinian to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
As We have observed that numerous vain formalities take place after
emancipation, and as the fictitious sale of free persons, as well as much
perplexing verbiage and injurious boxes on the ear, for which no reasonable
cause exists, We, for the purpose of disposing of all
these modes of expression, do order that he who desires to emancipate another
shall be granted permission to do so under the Anastasian Law, or to appear
before the tribunal of a competent judge, without being provided with an
Imperial Rescript, or to apply to other magistrates who have been invested with
jurisdiction of emancipation, either expressly by the laws, or in conformity
with long-established custom; and release from paternal authority and the
observance of all the legitimate rights to which he may be entitled (even
though he did not expressly reserve this for himself), his sons or daughters,
grandsons or granddaughters, or any of their descendants who may be under his
control, and as an act of generosity to give them their peculium,or transfer to
them any other property as well as such as they are not permitted to acquire,
but of which, in accordance with the terms of Our Constitution, they are
entitled to the usufruct; and all these things they can do, the empty
formalities of the ancient laws having been abolished by these provisions, as
has already been stated. Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof November,
after the Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
TITLE L. CONCERNING UNGRATEFUL CHILDREN.
1. The Emperors Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian to Pr&textatus, Prefect of the
City.
The laws punish, by the revocation of emancipation and the deprivation of
undeserved freedom, sons, daughters, and other descendants who have been guilty
of disobedience, or who have inflicted any verbal insult or atrocious injury
upon the parent who emancipated them.
Given at Milan, on the twelfth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate
of Lupicinus and Jovian, 367.
TITLE LI.
CONCERNING PERSONS WHO RETURN BY THE RIGHT OP POSTLIMINIUM, AND THE RANSOM OF
CAPTIVES FROM THE
ENEMY.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Ovinius.
A girl born of two captives in Sarmatia is considered to follow the condition
of her father, if both her parents return to Our territory, for although she
cannot, properly speaking, enjoy the right of postliminiumbecause she was not a
captive, still the return of her parents restores the girl to her father. If
the latter should be killed by the enemy, she must necessarily be considered to
follow the condition of her mother, who brought her daughter with her. For the
fiction of the Cornelian Law, which grants legal heirs to anyone who dies in
the
hands of the enemy, does not apply to one who is born in their hands, for the
reason that her father is considered to have died at the time when he was
captured.
Without date or designation of Consulate.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Publicianus.
Persons who have been ransomed from the enemy are deemed rather to be pledged
than reduced to a servile condition, until the price of their ransom has been
paid; therefore, if the amount expended for that purpose is given to them as a
donation, it is clear that they are restored to their former condition.
Hence, if you have married a captive, who was ransomed from the enemy after she
had been released from this condition of natural pledge, you should have no
apprehension with reference to either her condition or that of your common
children.
Published on the second of the Idesof June, during the Consulate of Gordian,
Consul for the second time, and Pompeianus, 242.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Varus.
As you allege that your relatives have not yet returned under the right of
postliminium,but are still living, and that their property is being
fraudulently squandered by the adverse party, the Governor of the province, if
applied to, will provide for the appointment of a public official who will take
charge of said property, after having furnished proper security.
Published on the fifth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of
Diocletian, Consul for the third time, and Maximian, 287.
4. The Same Emperors and C&sars to Hermogenes and Others.
It has not escaped Our notice that the estate of a woman, as long as it is not
known whether she is dead, or is held a prisoner by the enemy, cannot be
entered upon by her son, as the property of those who have fallen into the
enemy's hands can only be acquired by the right of succession from the time
when they are known to have died in captivity, and no compromise can take
place, or judgment be rendered, involving the property of one whose life and
fortune are uncertain.
Wherefore, after it has been ascertained that your maternal aunt died in the
hands of the enemy, you will be permitted to obtain possession of her estate
under the Praetorian Law, and your rights will not be prejudiced by any acts
which have been wrongfully performed with reference to the estate, and if you
are in the nearest degree, the whole of it will belong to you.
Published on the fifth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of
Diocletian, Consul for the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third
time, 290.
5. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Ursa.
As you say that your son, although not ransomed from the enemy, was, without
the execution of any contract, delivered by the barba-
rians to the prefect of the legion, he will be entitled to the right of
postliminium,and the Governor of the province must immediately order him to be
restored to his former status of a freeborn citizen.
Published on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of
Diocletian, Consul for the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third
time, 290.
6. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Justus.
As both the right of postliminiumand considerations of public utility demand
that those who have ransomed captives from the enemy should restore them to
their condition of freeborn citizens, after they have received the amount of
their ransom, and you allege that the person who ransomed you refused to accept
the amount of the ransom from you, or from another, the Governor of the
province will compel him, by the employment of the proper means, to obey the
laws, and having received the sum which he expended by way of ransom, not to
further annoy you with regard to your condition.
Published on the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of Tiberianus and
Dio, 291.
7. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Claudius.
We are impelled to suppress the infamy of a profligate female, and therefore,
as you state that your daughter was captured by the enemy, and after having
been prostituted by the woman who ransomed her, fled to you for the purpose of
preserving her chastity and the honor of her family, if the Governor of the
province should ascertain that the above-mentioned injury was inflicted upon
your daughter by a woman who knew that she was freeborn, as a person of this
kind is unworthy to have the amount of the ransom refunded on account of the
odium attaching to the detestable profit which she has obtained, even though
she may not already have been fully compensated by what she has gained from the
wretchedness and disgrace of your daughter, you can make a good defence against
the baseness of this wicked woman.
Published on the third of the Nonesof February, during the Consulate of
Tiberianus and Dio, 291.
8. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Matrona.
The Governor of the province will take care that you are no longer kept in
slavery, and he is too intelligent not to know that the status of your
childrenwhom you allege were born after you were ransomed should be
protected, as no authorities hold that children born after the ransom of their
parents are liable as pledges, on account of the price which has been paid for
the ransom of their mother.
Published on the fifth of the Idesof February, during the Consulate of
Tiberianus and Dio, 291.
9. The Same Emperors and Caesars to Gregorius.The Lex Corneliaconstitutes a son
the proper heir of his father who died during captivity if, in the meantime, he
should return, and
provided that, when he was captured, he was under his father's control.
Therefore, if you can prove before the Governor of the province that you are
entitled to the estate of your father, either by his will or on the ground of
intestacy, he will order the property of the estate to be delivered to you,
unless, after your return, so long a time has elapsed that your claim will be
barred by prescription.
Published on the fifth of the Idesof April, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors.
10. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Apollodora.
As free persons captured by the enemy, who have returned under the law of
postliminium,are restored to their former status, so, likewise, slaves are
returned to their masters. Hence, if the woman whom you mention was your
father's female slave was not ransomed in the course of trade, having returned,
she will again belong to her master, or to the heir of him who lost her through
captivity.
Ordered at Adrianople, on the third of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate
of the Csesars.
11. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Eutychius.
If Sabinus ransomed you from the enemy in the course of trade, and you were
free, and it is proved that he had released the lien which he had on you by way
of pledge for the ransom, you will not become a freedman, but will be restored
to the condition of a freeborn person, which you had lost, and you will owe no
services to the children of
Sabinus.
Ordered on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
12. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Quintiana.
Persons who have been captured by the enemy and not ransomed, but liberated by
the bravery of Our soldiers, at once recover the status which they had lost by
the accident of their captivity, and slaves are, moreover, restored to their
owners; for We should hold that those who are taken in this way are not
captured, and it is proper for Our soldiers to be their protectors, and not
their masters.
Ordered on the fifth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
13. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Quartina.
If he who ransomed you, a freeborn woman, from the enemy, then married you, it
is but reasonable that you should be released from the pledge for your ransom,
and restored to the condition in which you were born, by the dignity of
marriage, and the hope of future legitimate offspring.
Ordered on the fifth of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of
the Caesars.
14. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Severa.
The right of postliminiumgives a daughter, as heir at law, the estate of her
mother, where the latter died in slavery due to captivity,
by the mere fact of the occurrence; and, in the meantime, We shall not permit
any injury to be done to you by which you may be prevented from obtaining the
property belonging to your mother's estate.
Ordered on the sixteenth of the Kalends ofApril, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
15. The Same Emperors and Caesars to Macrotraulus.
When a freedman, who has been captured by the enemy, is ransomed, he can, by
virtue of his free birth, claim for himself any rights that he has in the
succession, even before he has refunded the money expended for his ransom, in
order that he may be able to repay it out of the funds of the estate.
16. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Basilida.
It is settled that, where the sons of a woman who has been ransomed from
captivity (even though born while she was a captive, of a father who was a
slave) shall, in accordance with the liberal interpretation of the law, enjoy
the freeborn condition of their mother.
Ordered on the fifth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
17. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Diogenia.
A freeman captured by the enemy, and afterwards ransomed, recovers his former
status from the time when he refunded the amount of his ransom, or was released
from its payment in any way whatsoever. In this instance, the son was ransomed
by his mother, and, as a contract of this kind is considered not to have been
made for the sake of reward, but through maternal affection, the intention of
receiving the son under the most desirable conditions at once restores him to
his mother, so that he will not be excused from the performance of civil
duties, on account of the former circumstances of his having been a prisoner of
war.
Therefore, as you ransomed your son from the enemy through motives of pecuniary
interest, it is not proper that you should repent of having done so, and that
you should claim any part of the sum that you paid; you can, however, justly
demand from him the dowry which he owes you.
Ordered on the third of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
18. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Triplinianus.
Persons who have been captured by the enemy, and have returned under the law of
postliminium,are entitled to a direct action to recover any property which they
have lost through the event of their captivity, and whatever has been lost
either by usucaption, release, or non-user shall be restored to them within the
available year by means of the action to re-establish them in their rights.
Published on the twelfth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
19. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to the General Severinus.
Those whose captivity was due to necessity are hereby notified that, if they
did not go over to the enemy, but were carried away during a hostile attack,
they should hasten to return to their own country, and that under the right of
postliminiumthey will receive any property they formerly possessed in lands,
slaves, or other effects, even though it may be in the possession of Our
Treasury. Nor let any of them anticipate any delay resulting from a contest, as
proof will only be required whether the party in question voluntarily
accompanied the barbarians, or whether he was compelled to go.
Given at Rome, on the sixth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of
Gratian, Consul for the fifth time, and Theodosius, 366.
20. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Theodore, Prse-torian Prefect.
No one shall detain, against their will, any of the inhabitants of Our
different provinces, no matter what their sex, condition, or age may be, whom
the cruelty of the barbarians has subjected to captivity, but they shall have
full power to return to their country, if they desire to do so. And, where any
expenditure has been made for clothing or provisions in their behalf, it should
be provided on the ground of humanity, nor should the return of such supplies
be demanded; except, however, where it is shown that the captives were
purchased from the barbarians, since it is only just that the price paid for
their freedom should be refunded to the purchasers on account of the public
welfare; for by the denial of this right, the prospect of loss may cause the
sale of captives reduced to such necessity, as they should refund to their
purchasers the amount paid for their ransom, or should compensate them by their
labor, or remain in their service during the term of five years, in return for
the benefit conferred upon them, at the end of which time they will recover
their freedom, that is to say, if they were born free. Therefore, they shall be
returned to their homes upon the terms which We have specified, and, even
according to the opinions of the ancient jurists, all their rights will remain
intact under the law of postliminium.
If anyone should attempt to violate this law, whether he be an agent, a lessee,
or an attorney, he shall be sentenced to the mines, as well as to the penalty
of deportation; and if he is the owner of property he is notified that it will
be confiscated to the Treasury, and that he himself will be liable to
deportation.
To the end that this law may be the more readily enforced, We desire the
Christians of neighboring places to cause it to be carried into effect. And We
decree that where cases of this kind arise, the decurions of adjoining cities
shall be notified to assist in the execution of this Our law; and all Governors
are warned that if they neglect to enforce it, a fine of ten pounds of gold
will be exacted from them, as well as from their subordinate officers.
Given on the third of the Idesof December, during the Consulate of Honorius,
Consul for the eighth time, and Theodosius, Consul for the third time, 409.
TITLE LII.
CONCERNING THE ABANDONMENT OP CHILDREN BOTH FREE AND SLAVE, AND CONCERNING
THOSE WHO RECEIVED NEWBORN CHILDREN FOR THE PURPOSE OP REARING
THEM.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Claudius.
If, without your consent or knowledge, the child of your female slave or serf
has been abandoned, you will not be prevented from recovering it. Its
restitution, however, provided it is not recovered from a thief, must take
place in such a manner that where anything has been expended for its support,
or instruction in a trade, you must refund the amount.
Published on the third of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of Julian,
Consul for the second time, and Crispinus, 225.
2. The Emperors Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian to Probus, Prse-torian
Prefect.
Every person should support his own offspring, and anyone who thinks that he
can abandon his child shall be subjected to the penalty prescribed by law. We
do not give any right to masters or to patrons to recover children who have
been abandoned, when children exposed by them, as it were, to death, have been
rescued through motives of pity, for no one can say that a child whom he has
left to perish belongs to him.
Given on the third of the Nonesof March, during the Consulate of Gratianus,
Consul for the third time, and Equitius, 274.
3. The Emperor Justinian to Demosthenes, Praetorian Prefect.
We decree that no one shall be permitted to claim as his, under the title of
ownership, vassalage, or tenancy, any child born either to freeborn parents, or
to freedmen, or to slaves, who has been abandoned. And We do not permit those
who have taken such children for the purpose of rearing them to do so with any
distinction, so as to bring them up and educate them, whether they are males or
females, in such a way as to hold them as slaves, freedmen, serfs, or vassals;
but children brought up by men of this kind shall, without distinction, be
considered free and freeborn, and can acquire property for themselves, and
transmit everything which they possess, in any way they may desire, to their
posterity, or to foreign heirs, without being branded with the stigma of
servitude, vassalage, or the restrictions attaching to the conditions of
tenancy or serfdom.
Nor do we concede that those who have received them have any right to their
property, and this law shall be enforced throughout the
entire extent of the Roman Empire. Nor shall those who, in the first place,
have abandoned their children and perhaps entertained the hope of their death,
and rendered their destiny uncertain, have any right to recover them from the
persons by whom they were rescued, and reduced them to slavery. Nor shall those
who, through motives of compassion, have supported these children, be allowed
to change their minds, and make them slaves, even though, in the beginning,
they took charge of them with this intention, lest it may appear that what was
dictated by benevolence has become merely a mercenary transaction.
These provisions shall be observed, not only by the illustrious Governors of
provinces, but also by the holy Bishops, the officers of the Governors, the
Senators and Defenders of cities, and all other Civil authorities.
Given at Chalcedon, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof October, during the
Consulate of Decius, 529.
Extract from Novel 54, Chapter I. Latin Text.
There was an ancient law which provided that children born of a free person and
a serf followed the condition of the serf, and this case has been submitted by
Justinian to the general rule that the child, so far as its freedom is
concerned, follows the condition of its mother.
TITLE LIII. WHAT is MEANT BY LONG-CONTINUED CUSTOM.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Aper.
The Governor of the province shall, after the case has been heard, decide in
accordance with the practice observed in the settlement of controversies of the
same description in the town where the suit was brought. For where a custom
exists, the reason which established it should be taken into consideration, and
the Governor of the province must be careful not to render a judgment which may
violate long-established usage.1
Published on the sixth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Julian,
Consul for the second time, and Crispinus, 225.
2. The Emperor Constantine to Proculus.
The authority and observance of long-established custom should not be treated
with contempt, but it should not prevail to the extent of overcoming either
reason or law.2
Given at Constantinople, on the seventh of the Kalendsof May, during the
Consulate of Constantine, Consul for the fifth time, and Licinius, 319.
1 "Consuetude manerii et loci observanda, est."ED.
2 "Consuetudo, licet sit magnse auctoritatis, nunquam tamen prasjudicat
manifests} veritati."ED.
3. The Emperors Leo and Anthemius to Alexander.
A custom adopted and observed steadfastly for a long period of time resembles a
law and obtains the force of one, and therefore We decree that any custom which
has reference to, and is observed by, offices, curiss,cities, public
institutions, or corporate bodies, shall have the effect of a perpetual law.1
Given on the seventh of the Idesof September, during the Consulate of Martianus
and Zeno, 469.
TITLE LIV. CONCERNING DONATIONS.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Lucius.
You understand that where written instruments conveying the title to slaves,
who have been purchased, have been given and delivered, the donation and
transfer of the slaves themselves are considered to have taken place, and
therefore you can proceed by an action in remagainst the donor.
Published on the fifth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Faustinus
and Rufinus, 211.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Leonis.
If, after having been emancipated, your father assigned to you, as a donation,
the right to collect a claim, the heir of your debtor will in vain allege that
the consent of the latter was necessary to the transfer, as it will be
sufficient if the rights of action for that purpose have been assigned to you.
Published on the second of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Gordian,
Consul for the second time, and Pompeianus, 242.
1 It is a matter of legal history that, until the reign of Constantine, the
long observance of a general custom, directly opposed to it, could annul a
statute which had been enacted in perfect conformity with all the prescribed
legislative requirements, a doctrine which placed written and unwritten laws
upon the same footing, as emanating from the same source, the i vox populi.The
Code of Justinian (Vill, LIII, 1, 3) ascribes equal validity of the two, a
rule, however, repeatedly contradicted in the Digest, by whose provisions the
supremacy of statutory legislation is consistently maintained. The same
principle is recognized in England. Scottish practice is at variance with this,
as custom can abrogate a legislative enactment in that country, especially
where a private right is involved. "As one statute may be explained by another,
so a statute may be explained by the uniform practice of the community, and
even go into disuse by a posterior contrary custom." (Erskine, Principles of
the Laws of Scotland I, I, 16.) Such was the force of long-continued usage
that, at Common Law, an Act of Parliament was necessary to abolish it. "No law
or custome of England can be taken away, abrogated, or adnulled, but by
authority of parliament." (Coke, Institutes II, IX, Page 96.)
The immense Coutwmier General de France,consisting of four great folio volumes,
much of whose contents isderived directly and indirectly from Roman sources,
indicates the importance and extent of customary law in France during the
existence of the French monarchy.ED.
3. The EmperorDeems to Marcellinus.
It has been held, not without reason, that the right of action to a future
expectation can be transferred with the full consent of the
donor.
Published on the Nonesof March, during the Consulate of Decius
and Gratus, 251.
4. The Emperor Probus to Marsia.
Your rights cannot be prejudiced if the taxes were paid by someone to whom the
property was not given, or by his agent, in his name.
Published on the fifth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Messala and Gratus, 280.
5. The Emperors Carinus and Numerianus to Flaconilla.
If the donation does not appear to have been made by means of a letter, still,
the words of the will, by which the generosity of the testatrix is confirmed,
no doubt have reference to a trust.
Published at Rome, on the sixth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate
of Carinus, Consul for the second time, and Numerianus, 284.
6. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Christiana.
It cannot be doubted that donations are valid, even when made between absent
persons, and, above all, if those upon whom the donations were bestowed have,
with the consent of the donors, acquired possession of the articles donated.
Published on the third of the Idesof February, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and Aquilinus, 286.
7. The Same Emperors and Caesars to Julius.
The census return made by another does not usually prejudice the owner of the
property, but if you consented for your stepson to return your slaves as his,
you will be considered to have given them to him.
Published on the Idesof July, during the Consulate of Diocletian, Consul for
the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third time, 290.
8. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Flora.
If the Governor of the province should find that you returned the fields in
question to the census in the name of your sons, without the intention of
donating them, he will decide in accordance with what the truth may suggest.
Published on the eighth of the Idesof September, during the Consulate of
Diocletian, Consul for the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third
time, 290.
9. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Augustiana.You can, by means of the action
of stipulation, proceed to enforce compliance with the condition which you
prescribed, in the donation of
your property; or you can bring suit for an indeterminate amount, that is the
Actio Prsescriptis Verbis,before the Governor of the province, who will see
that it is fulfilled.
Published on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
10. The Same Emperors and Csssars to Hermonia.
No one gives either ignorantly or unwillingly, and therefore if you did not
have in your mind the tract of land which it is stated in the instrument you
consented to donate, you understand that you will not lose what you did not
intend to convey, or did not specially indicate, as the force of truth is
greater than that of any written document.
Ordered on the fifth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of the Caesars.
11. The Same Emperors and Csssars to Sabinus.
According to your statement, you have retained a certain portion of your
property, and have transferred the remainder to him who is under your control,
as a donation. It is a plain rule of law that an act of this kind made in favor
of someone under paternal control is considered as having been done rather as
an evidence of the intention of the father than as a perfect donation. The
assignment of claims in favor of an emancipated son, however, operates as a
complete donation of the rights of action.
Ordered on the second of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
12. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Aurelian.
No one can be prevented from transferring to another, as a donation, his share
of any property which has not yet been divided.
Given on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
13. The Same Emperors and Caesars to Urania.
If it is proved that anything was given to you by means of a letter, the
brevity of the document evidencing the donation (if it is proved to have been
legally executed), will not affect your rights in any respect.
Given at Sirmium, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof June, under the Consulate
of the above-mentioned Emperors.
14. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Idasus.
If your son, without your consent, gave property to his betrothed which
belonged to you, he could not transfer it to her because it was not his.
Ordered on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
15. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Severn.Liability for debts due from an
estate does not attach to a person who has received any portion of it by way of
donation, but renders
the heir of the entire estate responsible. Therefore, if the land which you
obtained as a donation was not hypothecated to anyone, you need have no anxiety
that either the heirs, the donor, or her creditors, can legally bring suit
against you.
Ordered on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
16. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Theodore.Old age alone is not an
impediment to making a donation. Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof December,
during the Consulate of the above-mentioned Emperors.
17. The Same Emperors and Csssars to Hermia.
Whether you have donated property to your emancipated sons, or whether they
were still under your control, if, after they became independent, you did not
deprive them of their property donated, and which was in their hands, you must
not flatter yourself that, having changed your mind, you can deprive them of
what you gave them.
If, however, the property which you gave was obtained by them while under your
control, and after their emancipation they kept possession of it against your
consent, you will still retain the ownership of the same, as they could not
have obtained any of your property as long as they were subject to yeur
authority, even though you might have wished them to do so when they were
emancipated, because you subsequently were unwilling.
Ordered on the sixth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
18. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Audianus.
If it is proved that you are released from liability for an action of theft,
because the property in question was donated to you, you need have no
apprehensions.
Ordered on the fifth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
19. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Alexandria.
If your grandmother has bestowed her own property, as a gift, upon him against
whom you have filed your petition, there is nothing to prevent the gift from
being valid, whether the property was derived from the estate of your father or
your grandfather.
Ordered at Sirmium, on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof February, during the
Consulate of the Csesars.
20. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Helinius.
A donation legally effected is not considered void, even though made by a third
party, if the donor gave her consent.
Ordered on the seventh of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
21. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Antonia.
Your grandmother could not have given you her dowry, which was in the hands of
her husband during her marriage.
Ordered on the fifth of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of the Caesars.
22. The Same Emperors and Cassars to Diomede.
If, as you allege, you have given your property to your emancipated son under
the condition of his paying your creditors, whether you agreed to this
condition with reference to the property under a stipulation, or by a contract
which was entered into, an action will not lie in favor of your creditors
against your son, under the terms of your agreement, but it can be brought
against you.
It is, however, settled that he to whom you have given certain lands
conditionally can have an action for an indeterminate amount brought against
him, to compel him to fulfill the contract in accordance with the condition
prescribed.
Ordered at Sirmium, on the seventh of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate
of the Cassars.
23. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Olympias.
If the person who received the donation has, under a subsequent agreement,
returned to you, as a gift, the property which you donated to him, the
instrument evidencing the prior donation does not, by any means, annul the one
which followed.
Ordered on the fifth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
24. The Same Emperors and Caesars to Macarius,If you were not your father's
heir, it is a perfectly clear rule of law that your rights cannot be prejudiced
by his donation of property which belongs to you.
Published at Antioch, on the Nonesof February, during the Consulate of
Diocletian, Consul for the ninth time, and Maximian, Consul for the eighth
time, 304.
25. The Emperor Constantine to Maximus, Praetorian Prefect.
A donation, whether or not it is direct, or made in anticipation of death, or
held in abeyance because dependent upon a condition, or promised at some
specified time, or regulated by the intention of the donor and donee (to the
extent permitted by the law), should be subject to the following rule, namely:
it must contain only those conditions and agreements which are authorized by
the laws, and only such as are in conformity with this rule can be accepted,
and any contrary to it shall be rejected.
Where the donation has been evidenced by a written instrument, the name of the
donor, the title, and the description of the property shall be set forth, and
this must not be done either secretly or privately, but be written upon a
tablet, or upon any other kind of material which
may be at hand, either by the donor himself, or by some other person who is
present and has a right to do so; and the document should be registered after
having been drawn up in the presence of a judge, or a magistrate, whenever the
laws require this to be done.
Given on the third of the Nonesof February, during the Consulate of Sabinus and
Rufinus, 323.
26. The Same Emperor to Catulinus, Proconsul of Africa.
If anyone should desire to convey a tract of land to his emancipated minor son
before the latter is able to speak for himself, or hold any property donated to
him, he must comply with all the legal formalities required in the execution of
the instruments of this kind. It has been decided that a slave, whom the donor
may consider suitable, can be introduced, in order that the property may be
acquired by the infant through him.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate
of Sabinus and Rufinus, 316.
27. The Same Emperor to Severus, Count of the Spains.
We have decreed by a previously enacted law that donations shall be publicly
registered, and this rule should be especially observed by persons who are
merely related by blood, as anyone can, by means of clandestine and domestic
fraud, readily find an opportunity to feign a transaction, or to revoke an act
which has been lawfully performed. Therefore, as Our law does not except either
children or parents from the necessity of registering instruments evidencing
such donations, what We have already decreed with reference to their registry
will apply to all cases of this description. It is, however, sufficient for
their validity that such acts should take place everywhere, even when the
property is situated in some other place.
Given on the third of the Nonesof May, during the Consulate of Dalmatius and
Zenophilus, 333.
28. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Monaxius, Prse-torian Prefect.
Where anyone who donates property, bestows it by way of dowry, or sells it,
retains the usufruct of the same for himself, he will be considered to have
immediately delivered the property, even if no stipulation has been made on
this point, and nothing else will be required to establish the fact of its
transfer; but, in every instance, the reservation of the usufruct shall be
considered to imply delivery.
Given on the second of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Honorius,
Consul for the eleventh time, and the Caesar Constantius, Consul for the second
time, 417.
29. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Hierius, Praetorian Prefect.
It has been decided that a donation made for the benefit of strangers, and even
of persons who are unknown, is valid. If any-
thing should be donated without the transaction having been reduced to writing,
but all the other legal formalities have been complied with, it will stand.
Given on the eleventh of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Felix and
Taurus, 428.
30. The Emperor Leo to Constantine, Prsetorian Prefect.
Donations of property made in this Imperial City, no matter where it may be
situated, shall be recorded with the Master of the Census. Where, however, they
are made in other cities, whether the Governor of the province is absent or
present, or whether the said city has any magistrates or not, or only a
defender resides there, the donor shall have full power to register the
donation of his property, no matter where it may be situated, either before the
Governor of any province, or before a magistrate or defender of any city, whom
he may select; for just as a donation itself is dependent upon the intention of
the donor, so he shall be permitted to register it in the presence of any of
the above-mentioned officials. Donations of this kind which have been
registered in the different provinces and cities, before any of the officials
aforesaid, shall have incontestable and perpetual validity.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifth of the Nonesof March, during the
Consulate of Patricius and Richomer, 459.
31. The Emperor Zeno to Sebastian, Prsetorian Prefect.
We decree that it is not necessary for neighbors or other witnesses to be
called in the case of donations which have been publicly recorded, for the
evidence of private persons is superfluous where public records can be
produced. We also decree that as it is not necessary to record such donations,
if they have been drawn up by a notary or any other person, and are without the
signature of witnesses, as they will still be valid; provided, however, that
the donor himself or someone else, with his consent, has signed the document as
required by law. Donations made without having been committed to writing are
valid, in accordance with the Constitution of Theodosius and Valentinian,
addressed to Hierius, Prastorian Prefect.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Ello,
478.
32. The Emperor Anastasius to Euphemius, Prsetorian Prefect.
In accordance with the Constitution of the Divine Leo, We order that donations
shall only be recorded before the illustrious Master of the Census, and the
same rule shall be observed with reference to instruments of this kind as
applies to those which have been drawn up or executed in this Imperial City;
nor shall anyone be permitted to register them either in the presence of the
defenders or magistrates of other cities, or in any other places whatsoever
than the one above mentioned; and those who resort to this method of registry
as well as those who allow it to be done, and notaries who aid persons with
their testimony in any place or city not authorized by this law (as
previously stated) are hereby notified that, in addition to other penalties,
they will be subject to a fine of twenty pounds of gold.
Given on the day before the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Paulus,
Consul for the fifth time, 496.
33. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Prastorian Prefect.We hereby abolish that
perplexing rule under which persons who receive the assignment of actions as
donations are not permitted to transmit them to their heirs, unless they have
already instituted proceedings in court with reference to the same, or obtained
an Imperial Rescript releasing them from this requirement. For as it is
permitted for rights of action attaching to sales to be transmitted to heirs
after assignment, and before issue has been joined, so We desire that such as
have been donated shall be transferred to them, even though no proceedings have
been instituted, nor any demand made for payment. This rule shall also be
applicable to an attorney appointed to conduct cases of this kind, so that the
person to whom the rights of action have been assigned will not be prevented
from employing an attorney to bring suit, even though issue has not been
joined, or though any legal demand has previously been made.
We decree that these provisions shall only apply to persons who are known to be
living at this time, and to whom rights of action by means of a donation have
been assigned. For where persons of this kind are dead, We permit the ancient
laws enacted with reference to such assignments to be observed.
Given at Constantinople, during the month of June, under the second Consulate
of the Emperor Justinian, 528.
34. The Same Emperor to Demosthenes, Prsetorian Prefect.We order that every
donation which amounts to three hundred solidi,whether it be an ordinary one or
one made before marriage, shall follow the common rule, and that their registry
shall not be
required.
Where, however, a donation is made over and above the amount fixed by law, it
will not be valid, so far as any excess is concerned, but the remainder which
comes within the limits of the law shall continue in full force, just as if no
more had been added to it, which will be considered not to have been either
expressed or implied. Imperial donations, however, as well as such as are
devoted to pious uses are excepted, for it is reasonable that those made by the
sovereign should not be subjected to the rule requiring registry, but that the
Imperial source from which they are derived establishes their validity, a
provision which has been adopted by Our predecessors as well as by Ourselves.
Extract from Novel 52, Chapter II. Latin Text.
The same rule applies, and registry is not required, where a donation is made
by a private individual to the Emperor.
EENNDD OOPP TTHHEE EEXXTTRRAACCTT..
THE TEXT OP THE CODE FOLLOWS.
(1) We, however, decree that donations made for pious uses up to the sum of
five hundred solidishall be valid without registry, and, moreover, where ante-
nuptial donations are made to adult minors, who are their own mistresses, no
matter what sums they amount to, they shall be valid in accordance with the
provisions of the ancient laws, even though they may not have been publicly
registered.
When the donation did not consist of gold coin, but of movable or immovable
property or such as is capable of moving itself, an appraisement should be made
of the same, and if its value should be equal to that of the number of
solidiprescribed by law it will be valid, and shall stand without being
registered; but where it is found to exceed the sum specified, and it has not
been registered, it will only be void so far as the surplus is concerned.
(2) In order to prevent any dispute from arising with reference to the
transaction between the donor and the beneficiary of his generosity, We permit
him who is entitled to the larger amount of the property donated to have the
choice of tendering the remainder of what has been appraised to the person who
has the smaller share, so that he may have the whole of it. If, however, he
should not wish to do this, then the property shall be entirely divided
according to the share to which each one is entitled, if it is possible for
this to be done without loss. In cases of this kind, in which the division
cannot advantageously be made, if the owner of the larger amount is unwilling
to offer his portion to the others, then he who has the smaller share shall be
permitted to tender its value, and obtain the whole of it for himself.
(3) Moreover, if anyone has, at different times, made several donations to the
same person, some of which did not exceed the legitimate amount, although when
all were added the total was more than the sum authorized by law and appeared
to exceed it, they shall not be considered to be united and form but one sum,
and no rule shall be adopted by which the said donations may be decided to be
of no effect, and be revoked as void; but, on the other hand, they shall be
regarded as several in number and distinct, and each of them shall preserve its
character, and not require the formality of registry. For as different opinions
upon this point were held by the ancient authorities, some of them thinking
that the donations were several in number, others that they constitute but a
single one, We have believed it to be more humane that they should be
designated as several, and all be valid, and that those who have profited by
the liberality of the donors may know that the gifts of the latter were not
void.
(4) If, however, anyone should receive a donation in which it was stipulated
that the payment of a certain sum of money to him should be made every year,
which sum did not exceed that prescribed by law, in the case of donations,
there was a difference of opinion whether he who made this particular donation
did not, in fact, make several, and that they did not require to be registered,
or whether the annual donations proceeded from the source and origin of
the entire stipulation, and should be considered as but one donation, and
undoubtedly required the formality of registry.
The ancient authorities greatly differed on this point; but We, desiring to
permanently dispose of all these questions, hereby positively order that if a
donation of this kind should be made payable annually during the life of either
the donor or the donee, it shall be held to consist of several donations, and
to be exempt from the requirement of registry.
The uncertainty of fortune has suggested this rule to Us, as it is possible
that the donor or the donee may only survive for the term of one year, or for a
longer or a shorter time than this, and thus it may be ascertained that the
entire amount of the donation did not exceed that prescribed by law. If,
however, a mention of heirs has been made by either party, or the duration of
the life of either the donor or of him who received the donation, was added,
then the donation was, as it were, perpetuated, and rendered greater and more
valuable by means of the extension of time, and it should be understood to be a
single gift, and in its total amount to exceed that prescribed by law, and it
must, by all means, be registered, otherwise it will be void.
Read for the seventh time in the New Consistory of the Palace of Justinian, and
given on the third of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of Decius,
529.
35. The Same Emperor to Julian, Praetorian Prefect.
When anyone gives a donation of money, and states a certain weight, but does
not mention anything else, either generally or specifically, We require him, by
all means, to give the stated weight of silver, whether he should prefer to do
so in the form of vases, which shall not be less in value than the entire mass
of which they are composed, or whether the estimate is made of silver in
ingots, at the valuation that metal of this kind is worth in that part of the
country.
(1) If, however, anyone has donated a certain income from his lands without
specifying them, he will be obliged to transfer real-property from his estate
that will return as much income as he mentioned in the donation, but the said
real property need not be either the best or the worst which he has, but shall
be of the average value of
the same.
(2) In like manner, if anyone should donate a certain number of slaves, without
designating them by name, he should not deliver such as will be a burden rather
than an advantage; nor, on the other hand, is he compelled to deliver those who
are of greater value than any of his other slaves, but, under these
circumstances, a proper average should be considered.
(3) Where, however, the donor, having neither money nor slaves to give, or not
having the full amount which he gave, donates something, an appraisement should
be made of the deficiency, so that an estimate may be had of the amount of
silver or slaves (as We have previously stated) and, in appraising the slaves,
not more nor less than fifteen solidishall be estimated as the value of each
one, and in esti-
mating the income from land the valuation shall be based upon what it has been
worth for fifteen years.
In all these cases, however, if the donation is made within the limit
prescribed by law, no registry shall be required. But if it should exceed that
amount, then recourse must be had to registry, so that, with reference to what
exceeds the sum authorized by law, the excess alone, and not the entire amount,
shall be extinguished, in accordance with the rule which We already have
established.
(4) If, however, anyone should make a donation of his entire property, or of
the sixth, the half, the third, the fourth, or any other portion of the same,
and the law has not been invoked to declare his donation inofficious, he will
be compelled by the provisions of Our law to furnish the donee as much as he
gave him, and in this instance, as We have previously ordered, registry of the
donation shall by all means be required.
(5) If, however, in all of the above-mentioned cases, the usufruct of the
property should have been reserved by the donor, delivery shall be understood
to have been legally made. But if the donor did not expressly reserve it, and
any stipulation was inserted in the donation, delivery of the property can be
compelled to be made by virtue of the stipulation. But when this has been
omitted, and the donor did not reserve the usufruct, still, by Our law, the
necessity will be imposed upon him to also transfer what he intended to donate,
and the donation shall not be void for the reason that the property was not
turned over; nor shall it be confirmed merely by delivery, but the necessary
effect of the latter will render the donation complete, and it shall be
considered perfected according to Our law, and the donor will certainly be
required to deliver either the property in question, or a part of the estate
which he donated, or the whole of the same. For, as it depends upon the will of
everyone to do what he intended, he must either not carry out his intention,
or, after he has agreed to do so, he must not fail by having recourse to any
carefully considered artifice, and must show as much zeal in complying with his
engagements as in the invention of lawful excuses.
These rules will be all the more binding if the donation was made for pious
purposes, or to members of the clergy, and such donations must be registered in
accordance with the rule which has been specially laid down by Us in cases of
this kind, and where they have been made for pious purposes, as aforesaid, and
not carried into effect, the donor may be considered as irreverent and even
impious, and must remember that he will be liable, not only to the penalties
prescribed by law, but also to those inflicted by Heaven for fraudulent acts of
this description.
In all the instances above mentioned not only the persons themselves, but also
their heirs, will be compelled not only to deliver the property donated to
those to whom the gift was made, but to their heirs as well.

Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
36. The Same Emperor to. John, Prsetorian Prefect.
If anyone should contribute money for the ransom of captives, or bind himself
by giving security to do so, for any amount whatsoever, he is advised that he
cannot claim what he has given, or dispute the enforcement of his bond, on the
ground (as in the case of donations) that the sum is not payable for the reason
that the donation was not
registered.
On the other hand, he who received the money, whether immediately or after
security had been furnished, will be obliged to discharge his pious duty, and
he shall not be molested or annoyed either by him who gave him the money, or by
others who were authorized by the law to require this to be done; but he shall
only make oath that he actually paid the entire amount for the redemption of
captives, without the commission of fraud or any diminution of the sum which
was given
him.
(1) In like manner, We release from the necessity of registry all donations of
movable property, or of such as is capable of moving itself, which Our
distinguished generals may bestow upon Our brave soldiers, whether derived from
their own estates, or from the spoils of the enemy, at a time when they were
either engaged in actual military service, or were residing in any place
whatsoever.
(2) We also grant the same liberality of Our law to those whose houses have
been destroyed by fire or other casualty, and such persons, who have received
any sums of money, or in whose favor bonds have been executed, need not
apprehend any demand for the same, and they can only claim the amount which is
admitted to be due, even though no record has been made of the transaction; and
permission shall not be granted them to spend it for any other purpose than the
reconstruction of their houses. If any doubt should arise as to whether the
entire sum, or only a portion of it has been expended upon the building, this
shall be settled by the oath of the owner of the same.
(3) With reference to other donations We decree by the present law that they,
without distinction, shall not be required to be registered up to the amount of
five hundred solidi,for We think that donations above that amount should be
registered; and hence We amend Our law, previously enacted, by which donations
up to the sum of three hundred solidiwere held to be valid without registry.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof November, after the
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 531.
37. The Same Emperors to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
We decree that superfluous words which are ordinarily inserted in donations,
as, for instance, one sestertius,one drachma, four asses,should absolutely be
abolished. For what need is there to employ words which have no effect?
Therefore, We order that, under no circumstances, shall terms of this kind be
mentioned, either in Imperial donations or in any others; but if anyone should
make such insertions through mere verbosity, or omit to do so, it will make no
difference.

CONCERNING DONATIONS WHICH AKE MADE PROVISIONALLY OR UNDER A CONDITION, OR TO
TAKE PLACE AT A CERTAIN TIME.
1. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus to Gamica.
If you can prove, as you allege, that a donation was made by you to your
granddaughter, under the condition that she should furnish you with a certain
sum for your support, you are, in this instance, entitled to relief on the
ground that she refused to comply with the condition, that is to say, the right
of action by which the former ownership may be recovered will be restored to
you. For not only will you be legally entitled to a personal action, but the
Divine Emperors have decreed that, in a case of this kind, an action for the
recovery of the property should also be granted.
Published on the sixth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of
Tuscus and Bassus, 259.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Zeno.
If you donated the ownership of your property, under the condition that after
the death of the person who received it, it shall revert to you, the donation
will be valid, as it can be made either to take place at a certain or an
uncertain date, and the donee is required to comply with the condition imposed
upon him.
Published on the fifth of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and Aquilinus, 286.
3. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Marcella.
Whenever a donation is made under the condition that what is given shall, after
a certain time, be transferred to another, it is stated on the authority of
ancient rescripts that if he who is the beneficiary of a donation did not enter
into a stipulation, and did not comply with the condition of the agreement, a
personal action for recovery would lie in favor of the party who made the
donation, or his heirs. But as the Divine Emperors afterwards, through a more
indulgent interpretation of the law and in accordance with the wishes of the
donor, permitted a praetorian action to be brought by him who did not enter
into the stipulation, the action which your sister, if she had been living,
could have instituted, will be granted to you yourself as her successor.
Published on the eleventh of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of
Diocletian, Consul for the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third
time, 290.
4. The Same Emperors and Csesars.
Adonation which has been perfected does not admit of subsequent conditions; and
therefore, if your father, after having made a donation, added certain
conditions a short time afterwards, there is no
doubt whatever that this fact cannot to any extent prejudice the rights of his
grandchildren, the issue of your brother.
Given on the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of Tiberi-anus and Dio,
291.
5. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Dexippus.
If a mother should give something to her daughter, who is under the control of
her father, subject to the condition that she will be emancipated within two
years, although she did not become her own mistress in accordance with the
condition imposed by her mother, still, if the husband should die first, and
she should become independent in any way whatsoever, this case resembles the
bequest of a legacy, and she will be either entitled to the property donated,
or to an action to recover the same.
Ordered at Nicomedia, on the Idesof December, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
TITLE LVI. CONCERNING THE REVOCATION OP DONATIONS.
1. The Emperor Philip to Cosminus.
Even if, by means of perfect donations, a freedman at any time whatsoever
should obtain possession of property given to him, so as to have the full right
of possession as owner, still, if he should be ungrateful, the entire donation
can be revoked, if his patron should
change his mind.
This rule shall also be observed with reference to property purchased in the
names of freedmen with the money of their patrons, and for their benefit, as
those who, through their faithful service, have enjoyed the generosity of their
patrons, are not worthy to retain what has been given them when they begin to
neglect their duties; since liberality should rather induce them to discharge
their obligations than to be guilty of insolence.
This law, however, shall only apply to him who made the donation, but neither
his children nor heirs will be entitled to its benefit, for it is not just that
donations should in any way be interfered with which he who made them did not
revoke in this lifetime.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of -
aUmilianus and Aquilinus, 250.
2. The Emperor Probus to Felix.
If it should be proved before the Governor of the province that your daughter's
grandmother, impelled by regret for what she had done, destroyed by fire the
documents evidencing her donation, you need not fear that what has once been
lawfully valid can, by any subsequent act, be rendered doubtful.
Published on the Nonesof May, during the Consulate of Probus and Paulinus, 279.
3. The Emperors Carinus and Numerianus to Januarius and Felix.
Your mother cannot, by having merely changed her mind, alienate the land which
she donated to you after you had been emancipated.
Published on the second of the Idesof January, during the Consulate of Carinus,
Consul for the second time, and Numerianus, 284.
4. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Procula.
As you allege that you have donated property for the purpose of defrauding
another person, you understand that your confession is dishonorable; and
therefore, if you have perfected the donation, you cannot revoke it merely by
making the above allegation under the pretext of having changed your mind.
Published at Heraclia, on the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
5. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Epagathus.
If you made the donation in conformity with law, it cannot be rescinded by the
authority of Our Rescript.
Ordered at Heraclia, on the fifth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of
the above-mentioned Emperors.
6. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Herennia.
In the beginning you were perfectly free to give, or not to give, to your son
the lands and slaves referred to; therefore, cease to ask that the donation
which you perfected be revoked on the ground of the absence of your husband,
and your other children, as the validity of the donation is not dependent upon
their presence.
Ordered on the fifth of the Kalends ofOctober, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
7. The Emperors Constantine and Constantius to Philip.
To those mothers alone who have not contracted a second marriage, but have only
been married once, We grant the power to revoke any donations which they have
made to their children, when they are guilty of ingratitude towards them.
Therefore, he who is accused of ingratitude by his mother will, by order of the
presiding judge, be compelled to restore to her whatever he holds under the
title of donation, from the very day on which issue was joined in the case. We,
however, by no means permit to be revoked any gift of property acquired by the
son while on good terms with the mother, and which has been sold, donated,
exchanged, bestowed by way of dowry, or alienated for any other lawful reason,
before judicial proceedings were instituted.
Moreover, We desire that the action granted to the mother shall be a personal
one, and shall only have the effect of recovering the property, and that it
shall not be granted against, or in favor of an heir. We think that enough has
already tacitly been provided with reference to other mothers, who lead
disreputable and dissolute lives;
for who can imagine that any favor should be granted them, as We are willing to
accord none of these privileges to women who have merely contracted a second
marriage?
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of Liminius
and Catulinus, 349.
Extract from Novel 22, Chapter XXXV. Latin Text.What a mother gives to her son
cannot be revoked on the ground of ingratitude after she has contracted a
second marriage, except for three reasons. First, if an attack is made by him
upon her life; second, if he has laid violent hands upon her; third, if he has
attempted to cause her to lose all her property.
8. The Same Emperor to Orphitus, Praetorian Prefect.
If a patron who has no children should, by way of donation, ever bestow all his
property, or a portion of the same, upon his freedmen, and afterwards should
have issue, everything which was donated shall revert to him who gave it, and
remain subject to his will and at
his disposal.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate
of Arbitio and Lollianus, 355.
9. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to the Senate.
Neither a father, a grandfather, nor a great-grandfather can revoke donations
made to a son or a daughter, a grandson or a granddaughter, or a great-grandson
or a great-granddaughter, who has been emancipated, unless it is proved by
perfectly clear evidence that the person to whom the donation was made has been
guilty of ingratitude and want of filial affection, in one of the cases
enumerated
by the laws.
Given at Ravenna, on the fifth of the Idesof November, during
the Consulate of Theodosius, Consul for the thirteenth time, and
Valentinian, Consul for the third time, 430.
10. The Emperor Justinian to Julian, Prs&torian Prefect.
We decree, in general, that all donations made in conformity with
law shall be valid and irrevocable, and if he who receives the donation is not
found to be guilty of ingratitude towards the donor, as, for instance, where he
has inflicted atrocious injury upon him, or has been guilty of personal
violence towards him, or of having, by treachery, caused him to suffer great
pecuniary losses which sensibly diminished his estate, or has exposed him to
the danger of losing his life, or is unwilling to comply with any agreements
inserted in the document evidencing the donation, or even if these were not
committed to writing, and he, as the recipient of the donation, promised to
observe
them, but failed to do so.
But only for causes of this kind, where they have been regularly proved in
court by indisputable evidence, do We permit donations made to such persons to
be revoked, in order that no one may have permission to accept the property of
another, and then ridicule his
liberality, subject him to loss, and cause him to suffer the injuries above
mentioned from the ungrateful beneficiary of his bounty.
We, however, decree that this provision shall only apply to the persons
originally interested, as permission is not granted to the heirs of the donor
to file complaints upon such grounds; for if he who suffered these indignities
remains silent, his silence should always continue; and his posterity ought not
to be allowed to institute legal proceedings either against the individual
alleged to be ungrateful, or his heirs.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of
Lampadius and Orestes, 530.
TITLE LVII. CONCERNING DONATIONS CAUSA MORTIS.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Daphna.
Where it is stated in the donation that if one of the donees should die, and
his share accrue to the others, an action based on a trust will lie if the
condition should be fulfilled, and the donation be perfected by the death of
the donee.
Published on the fourth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of
Maximus, Consul for the second time, and ^lianus, 224.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Zoilus.
Your granddaughter, born of your son and daughter-in-law, will succeed to her
mother who died intestate; but still, the former, after the death of your son
by whom she had the daughter, was not, when she married a second time,
prevented from imposing any condition which she may have wished upon her dowry
when she gave it.
If she stipulated that her dowry was to go to her brother as a donation mortis
causa,in case of her own death, as it was provided by a Constitution of the
Divine Severus, that where donations mortis causawere involved and the deceased
did not leave other property, the heir would not be entitled to the amount
prescribed by the Falcidian Law, he who is the heir of your daughter-in-law
will not be prevented from claiming the benefit of this constitution.

Gordian and Aviola, 240.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Cassars, to Hseres.
A sister is not permitted to rescind a donation mortis causawhich has been
legally made by her brother.
Ordered at Sirmium, on the third of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate
of the above-mentioned Emperors.
4. The Emperor Justinian to Julian, Prsetorian Prefect.A doubt arose with
reference to the effect of a donation mortis causa,and certain authorities
placed it among last wills, and were of
the opinion that it should be compared to a legacy; others held that it should
be classed among donations inter vivosare living.
For the purpose of resolving this doubt, We order that all donations mortis
causa,whether they were made at the time of death, or previous to it after long
consideration, shall, by no means, require to be registered; nor shall the
presence of public officials be exacted, or compliance with the legal
formalities which are customary in the execution of instruments of this kind be
necessary; but their validity shall be the same as if anyone desired to make a
donation mortis causain the presence of five witnesses, or by an instrument in
writing; or, even if nothing was written, the transaction shall remain
perfectly valid without having been registered, and no attack can be made upon
it on this ground; nor shall it be considered without force and void for this
reason, but it shall have the same effect that last wills possess, and shall
not be understood to differ from them in any respect.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof September, during the fifth Consulate
of Lampadius and Orestes, 532.
TITLE LVIII.
CONCERNING THE ABOLITION OP THE PENALTIES OP CELIBACY AND WIDOWERHOOD AND THE
ABROGATION OP
TITHES.
1. The Emperors Constantine, Constantius, and Constans to the People.
Those who were considered celibates by the ancient law are hereby released from
any apprehension of legal penalties, but can live just as if they were
performing the duties of matrimony, and were included among husbands; and all
of them shall have the same right to take under a will which others enjoy.
Nor shall anyone be considered to bear the stigma of a widower, and such
penalties as have previously been prescribed on this account shall no longer
have any force.
We decree that this same rule shall also apply to women, and We release all
persons, without distinction, from this yoke which has been imposed upon their
necks by the authority of the law.
Given at Rome, on the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Constantius,
Consul for the second time, and Constans, 239.
2. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Isidore, Prefect of the City.
We decree that the provision of the Lex Papiawith reference to tenths,
affecting man and wife, shall be abolished, and even though there may be no
children, each of them shall be allowed to receive the entire amount of the
estate of his or her consort when left by will (unless some other law should
prevent this from being done). Hence, hereafter, a husband or a wife can leave
to one another as much of their respective estates as affection for the
survivor may dictate.
Given on the Nonesof September, during the Consulate of Varana.
TITLE LIX. CONCERNING THE RIGHT OF CHILDREN.
1. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Isidore, Prefect of the City.
Let no one hereafter apply to Us for the right of children, for by this law We
grant it to all without distinction.
Given on the Nonesof September, during the Consulate of Varana, 410.
2. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Prsetorian Prefect.
In accordance with the principles of equity, We abolish the injustice which
was, in former times, committed against the mother of a deceased person of
either sex, and We order that she shall be fully entitled to the legal rights
granted by the Tertullian Decree of the Senate, even though, being a freeborn
woman, she may not have had three children, or if being a freedwoman, she may
not have had four.

TITLE I.
CONCERNING THOSE WHO CANNOT BRING AN ACCUSATION.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Sylvanus.
You should first answer the charges of murder and wounding of which you are
accused by your adversary, because they are more serious, and then the judge
will determine according to the circumstances of the case whether you shall be
permitted to accuse your adversary, even though you may have been the first to
bring an accusation.

and Clement, 196.
2. The Same Emperors to Ingenuus.
If your guardians or curators consider the receipts, by means of which
Secundinus says he can prove that the money has been paid to
Eugenius, to be suspicious and false, they will not be prevented from bringing
an accusation for forgery in their own names (as this cannot be done in the
name of another), for neither guardians nor curators, who administer the
affairs of their wards or minors, at their own risk, are readily branded with
infamy, unless their guilt of malicious prosecution is clearly apparent tc the
judge.
Published on the twelfth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of
Antoninus and Geta, 206. 3. The Emperor Alexander to Rufus.
Those who intend to bring an accusation of a public crime should not be
permitted to do so, unless they have first committed the charge to writing, and
have furnished a surety that they will prosecute. If, however, after having
furnished security, they should not appear, they shall be notified under the
Edict that they must come and conduct the case, and if they do not appear,
extraordinary measures should be taken to punish them according to the
discretion of the judge; and they shall also be compelled to pay the costs
which those who have been summoned have incurred, as well as the travelling
expenses of the latter.1
1 The king was the original, supreme criminal magistrate in whom was solely
vested the right to inflict capital punishment and confiscate property.
Jurisdiction of minor offices was delegated to members of the Senate who were,
as occasion required, especially designated for this purpose. As in every age
the infancy of nations, the regal, autocratic power exerted in the hearing and
determining of criminal cases was derived from the military supremacy attaching
to the office of sovereign as head of the army.
The consuls succeeded the kings in the cognizance of crimes. The increasing
influence of the people, however, eventually deprived them of much of this
authority, which then became vested first in the Comitia curiata,and then in
the Comitia centuriata,the popular assemblies of the capital of the Roman
world. The power of the latter body was, for convenience, ultimately
transferred to a jury presided over by the Praetor. The Senate, also,
constituted a High Court of Justice for the prosecution of offences, which on
account of their magnitude or unusual character seriously menaced the welfare
or existence of the State; still, even under such circumstances, it very rarely
personally exercised its authority, but delegated it to some magistrate of high
rank, who was empowered to conduct the investigation and render judgment.
The criminal procedure of the Romans was at first, as well as for a
considerable period afterwards, circumscribed by no well-defined collection of
rules or established precedents. No laws constituting crimes, and prescribing
their punishments, had been passed. Even custom, usually so authoritative in
the absence of appropriate legislation, was frequently disregarded. Every case
was tried separately and independently, and the penalty inflicted was entirely
in the discretion of the judge, whose sentence was presumed to be in accordance
with what the nature of the offence demanded. Whenever judicial authority was
delegated, it only endured until the termination of that particular proceeding.
It was by slow and irregular steps that criminal jurisprudence became finally
embodied in a code, whose enactments fixed with some degree of certainty what
had formerly been regulated by the arbitrary and irresponsible conclusions of
the royal or magisterial personages, not infrequently prejudiced and
incompetent, to whom was long committed the vital interests of both patrician
and plebeian in the administration of justice.
Under the Republic, the Senate had, strictly speaking, no direct criminal
jurisdiction over Roman citizens. It could, however, prosecute and punish

5. The Same Emperor to Marcellina.
Awoman is not permitted by the Decree of the Senate to accuse the defendant of
forgery under the Lex Cornelia,,unless the property belongs to her. Therefore,
as your sons have guardians and curators, they should determine whether the
instruments by means of which you allege the adversary of your sons has
profited should be denounced as forged.

ally serious offences such as cases of rebellion and sedition, both in the city
itself and in the provinces.
The prefects were, under Imperial rule, the judges possessing the most
extensive criminal jurisdiction. The aediles, in addition to their other
numerous duties, took cognizance of breaches of the law of comparatively
trifling importance. During the Empire, the autocratic character of the
sovereign rendered the decisions of the Senate nugatory when they did not fully
meet with his approval, an event of extremely rare occurrence, as the imperial
will, which dominated that august body, was generally known, and impliedly
possessed the power of a mandate, which few, indeed, would venture to
disregard.
The quxstio,or trial, was originally conducted before a commission appointed to
hear each offence; afterwards the citizens designated for this purpose served
for a specified time, usually a year, and the tribunals over which they
presided were styled qusestiones perpetuse.
Every quxstiowas decided by jurors whose number was fixed by the enactments
under which the proceedings were conducted. The information at our disposal
shows that this varied from thirty-two to four hundred and fifty, the latter
being required when the defendant was accused of abusing his official authority
for purposes of extortion. The members of the jury were, in the beginning,
taken from the Senate; afterwards, however, Roman citizens were charged with
this duty, and their names were publicly inscribed by the Praetor upon the
albumin the Forum. These jurors were styled judices selecti.
When the time for trial arrived, a struck jury was empaneled. The accuser
selected a certain member, and then the defendant exercised this privilege.
Under the Cornelian Law, only three could be challenged by each party, but
afterwards the laws authorized the rejection of the entire panel by either
side, a proceeding corresponding to the "challenge of the array" at Common Law,
which, no doubt, deduced its origin from the practice of the Roman tribunals.
The jurors were regularly sworn to render their verdict according to the law
and the evidence, as justice might dictate; and the judge specially appointed
to preside in the case was also, at the same time, obliged to make oath to
7. The Same Emperor to Felix.
Ifshe who has accused you of a crime should delay to prosecute, a competent
judge must fix a certain time for her to do so; and if she fails to proceed
within that time, she will be understood to have abandoned the case.
Published on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of
Agricola and Clement, 231.
8. The Emperor Gordian to the Soldier Gaius.
Soldiers are not forbidden to bring an accusation of a public crime, if they do
so for an injury committed against either themselves or their relatives; hence
We permit you to prosecute the murderer of
your cousin.
Published on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof August, during
the Consulate of Pius and Pontianus, 239.
9. The Same Emperor to Severia.
A competent judge will understand that she who wishes to prosecute for, and
avenge the death of her son, should not be permitted to file the accusation
before she proves that she is his mother.

and Aviola, 240. perform the duty demanded by the requirements and
responsibilities of the judicial
office.
In compliance with the rule authorized by Justinian, a witness could not be
forced to incriminate himself: "Deferre se nemo cogitur."Before the days of the
Empire, torture could only be applied to slaves, and under certain
restrictions, but afterwards, both the witnesses and the defendant might be
subjected to it. It was only tolerated in order to strengthen other evidence or
presumptions already existing, and could not be inflicted with excessive
severity.
After the evidence had been introduced and the arguments heard, the judge
demanded the verdict, which, in early times, was given by each juror viva
voce.The ballot was afterwards substituted for the oral vote as being more
convenient and satisfactory. There were three ways in which a juror could
render his verdict. If he wished to vote for conviction, he simply inscribed
the letter "C," (condemno,I convict) upon the tablet given him for that
purpose; a vote for acquittal was indicated by an "A," (absolvo, "Iacquit") ;
if he desired to evade responsibility, or was unable to decide, he wrote "N.
L." (non liquet,"It is not clear"); and a sufficient number of such ballots
practically effected a dismissal of the case (ampliatio),which could be tried
again with the consent of the Prsetor, upon payment of costs. Unanimity of the
jurors was not requisite for the finding of a verdict, only a majority being
necessary.
Appeals were, in the course of time, permitted to be made to the Emperor, or to
certain courts invested with appellate jurisdiction. Precipitation from the
Tarpeian Rock, decapitation, scourging, burning alive, crucifixion, and hanging
were the penalties for capital crimes. Minor infractions of the law were
expiated by banishment, penal servitude, whipping, fines, and infamy. A culprit
could usually escape death, either before or after trial, by going into
voluntary exile. There is no mention by Cicero of conviction of a capital
offense being followed by execution in his time.
Much obscurity characterizes the administration of criminal justice in Italy
and the provinces. It is known, however, that a capital case could not be
disposed of in any Italian court outside of Rome.ED.
10. The Same Emperor to Buccatrahius.
If you desire to prosecute anyone for crimes committed against yourself or your
relatives, commit your accusation to writing with the legal formalities, in
order that you may have the Governor of the province preside in the case.
Published on the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Gordian and Aviola,

11. The Emperor Philip and the Csssar Philip to Saturninus and Others.
As you allege that the adverse party purposely burned your property, you can
prosecute him under the Lex Cornelia de Sicariis.
Published on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of
Peregrinus and ^milianus, 245.
12. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Cdssars, to Corinthia.
Awoman is not permitted to bring an accusation of a public crime except in
certain cases, that is to say, where the injury is committed against her or her
relatives, and she is expressly authorized by the ancient law to do so; nor is
such an accusation required to be committed to writing. Therefore, if you apply
to the Governor of the province, he will, in the first place, examine whether
the crime is one of those for which a woman is not forbidden to prosecute.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors.
13. The Same Emperors and Czesars to Asclepius.
Where one brother brings the accusation of a serious or capital crime against
another, he not only should not be heard, but he should be condemned to the
penalty of exile.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
14. The Same Emperors and Ciesars to Mlia.
If your natural love and affection do not prevent you, you can bring an
accusation against your son before the Governor of the province, on account of
the attempt which you allege he made against your life.
Ordered on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
15. The Same Emperors and Caesars to Lupio.
If your reputation is good, you are by no means forbidden to bring a criminal
accusation, of course at the risk of being punished for malicious prosecution.
Ordered on the third of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
16. The Same Emperors and Caesars to Calluticus.Your desire coincides with the
rule of law which does not permit a third accusation to be brought by him who
has previously brought
two others, unless he desires to institute prosecution for an offence committed
against himself or his relatives.
Ordered at Nicomedia, on the twelfth of the Kalendsof December, during the
Consulate of the Caesars.
17. Extract from a Sentence of the Same Emperors and Csesars.
Published on the fifth of the Idesof January, during the Consulate of the
Emperors Diocletian and Maximian.
We think that it is unjust, and far from consonant with the auspicious events
of Our century, that Thaumasius should have the power to accuse him in whose
house (although he was freeborn) it is proved that he had remained from
infancy. Therefore the accusation of crime which he has brought against
Symmachus shall not be entertained. If, however, the said Thaunasius should
wish to bring a civil action him before the Governor of the province, he can do
so.
18. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Julianus.
If you wish to accuse your sister of a minor offence, you will not be prevented
from doing so in the tribunal of the Governor of the province, by whom the said
offence rashly committed will be punished
with the proper penalty.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Diocletian,
Consul for the ninth time, and Maximian, Consul for the eighth time, 304.
19. The Emperors Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian to Lauditius, Prefect of
Sardinia.
Accused persons are denied permission to accuse their prosecutors of a crime of
equal or less gravity, unless it was committed against them or their relatives,
before they themselves have, in accordance with the provisions of the ancient
laws, been acquitted of the offence with which they are charged; but they can
file their information even while the accusation against them is still pending.
Given on the day before the Idesof August, during the Consulate of Gratian,
Consul for the third time, and Equitius, Consul for the fifth time, 374.
20. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Eutychianus, Prse-torian Prefect.
If a retainer or slave belonging to someone's household should appear as an
informer against, and an accuser of the latter, to whose family he belonged and
whose society he enjoyed, which accusation would cause him to lose his
reputation, his life, and his property, he shall be struck with the avenging
sword before the witnesses are produced, and the examination of the case takes
place, or even before the criminal accusation has been begun; for it is better
to put a summary end to such a criminal charge than for it to be heard. We,
however, except from this rule the crime of high treason alone.
Given at Constantinople, on the sixth of the Idesof November, during the
Consulate of Csesarius and Atticus, 397.

21. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to the Consuls, Pr%-tors, Tribunals of
the People, and Senate, Greeting:
If freedmen should presume to accuse those who have manumitted them, or their
heirs, they shall be liable to the same punishment inflicted under similar,
circumstances upon slaves, and they shall pay the penalty before their
forbidden accusation has begun.
Given on the seventh of the Idesof August, during the Consulate of
Asclepiodotus and Marinianus, 423.
TITLE II.
CONCERNING ACCUSATIONS AND DENUNCIATIONS IN WRITING.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Martian.
The Governor of the province will not be ignorant that those who remove
landmarks should be punished with extraordinary severity.
Published on the third of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of
Alexander, 223.
2. The Same Emperor to Syrus.
Where a slave is accused of any crime whatsoever, his master can defend him,
appear in court, and answer the charge of his accuser. But after the proof of
the crime has been established, not the master himself but -the slave shall be
condemned, for a master is only permitted to defend his slave in order to be
able to make suitable allegations in his behalf.
Published on the eleventh of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of
Alexander, 222.
3. The Same Emperor to Stephanides.
The laws relating to public prosecutions permit persons who are accused of
capital crimes, and who are absent, to be defended by an attorney.
Published on the fourth of the Nonesof November, during the Consulate of
Maximus, Consul for the second time, and .^Elianus, 224.
4. The Emperor Gordian to Archelaus.
In case the accusers are absent, and have not failed to be present in court
through contumacy, and the Governor of the province, having been applied to by
the party accused, has, without hearing the case, rendered a decision that he
against whom you have complained shall be discharged, the criminal accusation
will still continue to exist, as it was not dismissed through the contumacy or
neglect of the accusers; and the said criminal case shall be heard by the same
judge or his successor, in the ordinary way.
Published on the Nonesof March, during the Consulate of Gordian, Consul for the
second time, and Pompeianus, 242.
5. The Same Emperor to Paulinus.
He who brings an unjust accusation is none the less liable for a crime or an
atrocious injury, for the reason that he alleges that another directed him to
make it; for in this instance it is well established that proceedings can be
instituted not only against the principal guilty party, but that his mandator
is also personally responsible.
Published on the third of the Idesof September, during the Consulate of
Gordian, Consul for the second time, and Pompeianus, 242.
6. The Same Emperor to Avidianus.
It is an ancient rule of law that a person who is absent cannot be accused of a
capital crime;1 but it is only necessary for the accusation to be recorded, if
the defendant is not present. Therefore, as you, while absent and ignorant that
you had ever been accused of any crime, have, as you state, been unjustly
sentenced to the mines by the Governor of the province, without, as you assert,
ever having been able to learn that you had been prosecuted; in order that the
truth may now be ascertained in your presence, do not fail to appear before the
Praetorian Prefect, who will take cognizance of any innovation contrary to the
provisions of the Imperial Constitutions which may have taken place, and will
correct it in conformity with justice.
Published on the fourth of the Nonesof April, during the Consulate of Arianus
and Pappus, 244.
7. The Same Emperor to Proculus.
It is a well-known fact that denunciations of crimes made by public officials
before Governors should be examined without the ordinary formalities required
in the case of accusations. The judge, however, should not fail to carefully
investigate the grounds of the accusation, especially if it is suspected of
being false, or is well known to be such.
Published on the eighth of the Idesof January, during the Consulate of
Peregrinus and .ZEmilianus, 245.
8. Extract from the Imperial Letters of the Emperors Diocletian and Maximian.
If anyone should think that he has sustained an injury from another, and
desires to make a complaint against him, he should not apply to the
stationarii,2but should appear before the Governor, and either file his
statement, or cause his complaint to be recorded.
Published without date or designation of Consulate.
1 "Nemo ina/uditur nee summonitus condemnari debet, si non sit contumax."ED.
2The stationariiwere officials stationed (as the name implies) everywhere
throughout the Roman Empire, whose duty it was to collect information
concerning criminal offences, and transmit it to the proper authorities to be
acted upon. No written accusation or indictment was necessary under such
circumstances, but the prosecutor was compelled, no matter how distant he migth
be, to appear in court, and produce evidence in support of the charge.ED.
9. The Same Emperors to Honoratus.
Anyone who has been charged with a public crime, cannot again be accused of the
same crime by another person.1 If, however, several offences arise from the
same act, and complaint is only made of one of them, it is not forbidden for an
accusation of another to be filed by some other individual. The judge will
grant a hearing for both crimes, as he will not be permitted to pass sentence
for one of them separately before a thorough examination of the other has taken
place.
Published on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of
Bassus and Quintianus, 289.
10. The Same Emperors and C&sars to Ursa.
Anyone who holds out the hope of acquittal to an accused person, whose fate is
under the power and in the hands of the judge, does not, by this unlawful
promise, commit a crime of less gravity than that committed by someone who in
violation of public order hires him to do this.
Published on the third of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of
Diocletian, Consul for the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third
time, 290.
11. The Same Emperors and Csssars to the Children of Our Beloved Crispina.
If anyone thinks that he ought, in accordance with public law, to accuse
someone of the crime of homicide, who has already been charged with the same
offence by another, who was unable to prove him guilty, he must first show that
there was collusion, and that the defendant was acquitted for this reason; as
this has very properly been prescribed by Our predecessors, the Emperors.
If, however, he should not think that this can be done, you can compel him to
prosecute the shepherds and robbers for the crime, and have it decided in your
court, and if it is apparent that it was committed by the accused, he will be
liable to public punishment under the law.
Given on the eighth of the Idesof April, during the Consulate of Annibalianus
and Asclepiodotus, 292.
12. The Same Emperors and Csssars to Aurelius.
An innocent person cannot incur the risk of prosecution where someone has
voluntarily committed suicide.
Ordered at Sirmium, on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof June, during the
Consulate of the above-mentioned Emperors.
1 "Nemo debet bis punire pro uno delicto."This salutary and equitable rule is
undoubtedly the original source whence is derived the provision of our organic
law prohibiting any person "for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy
oofflife or limb," as set forth in Article V of the Constitution.ED.
13. The Emperors Valerian, Gratian, and Theodosius to Marini-anus, Vicegerent
of Spain.
If anyone should think that slaves ought to be accused, he must not subject
them to bodily torture before filing a written accusation
against them.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Merobaudus, Consul for the second time, and Saturninus.
14. The Same Emperors and Arcadius to Cynegius, Prsetorian Prefect.
One and all judges are hereby notified that, in the prosecution of public
crimes, they ought not to make use of decrees pronounced in other cases, or
place implicit reliance upon statements drawn up by public officials, but
should endeavor to ascertain the truth in each particular case.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Kalendsof May, during the
Consulate of Arcadius and Bauto, 385.
15. The Same Emperors to Tatianus, Prsetorian Prefect, Sequel to Other Matters
Stated.
It is proper for men of high rank to appear personally in court, when their
presence in criminal cases is demanded by a written accusation; although, in
actions involving money, they can make their defence by means of attorneys.
Given at Milan, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate
of Valentinian, Consul for the fifth time, and Neoterius, 390.
16. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Pasiphilus.
In the trial of criminal cases it is proper that those accusations should first
be heard which involve the most serious offences, and are prior in order of
time, so that the authority of the law may terrify one or the other of the
parties; and if this rule should be violated, those whose duty it is to preside
shall be sentenced to pay a fine of five pounds of gold.
Given on the eighth of the Idesof January, during the Consulate of Olybrius and
Probinus, 395.
17. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to the Consuls, Praetors, Tribunes of
the People, and Senate, Greeting:
We order that the provisions heretofore enacted in the laws with reference to
accusations shall be observed, so that whoever is charged with a capital crime
shall not immediately be considered guilty, merely because he has been accused,
in order that innocence may not be unjustly punished; but that the accuser
shall appear in court, give the name of the defendant, make the accusation in
writing, and become, as it were, a prisoner (proper consideration being had to
his rank), to prevent him from making false statements with impunity, as the
same punishment should be inflicted upon one bringing a false accusation as the
latter intended should be imposed upon the innocent party. Let no one flatter
himself that he can hope for pardon after having confessed under torture that
he was guilty of crime, or that any attention will be paid to his false
denunciation of persons of superior rank, or to any made against his enemies,
whom he desires to involve with himself in a common fate, or expect that he can
escape, either through the efforts or the privileges of those whom he named,
for the provisions of the ancient law require that he shall be examined only
with reference to offences of which he has confessed himself guilty, but not
concerning those in which others are implicated, and therefore no one who
admits that he is guilty of crime shall be examined as to the complicity of
others.
Given at Ravenna, on the eighth of the Idesof August, during the Consulate of
Asclepiodotus and Marinianus, 423.
TITLE III.
CONCERNING THE PRODUCTION AND TRANSFER OF PERSONS ACCUSED OF CRIME.
1. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Valentinian.
When a soldier is found to have committed a public crime in a province, the
Governor must take him into custody, and make a report setting forth the nature
of the case, and the rank of the party implicated.
Given at Milan, on the twelfth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate
of Valentinian and Valens, 365.
2. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Eutro-pius, Prsetorian
Prefect.
No accused person shall, under any circumstances, be confined in prison before
he has been convicted. If he should happen to be a long distance away, the
accusation shall not be received before the accuser formally agrees that, if he
should fail to legally prove the charge, he will submit to the penalty which
the other party would have suffered if he had been found guilty. A sufficient
time, consisting of not less than thirty days, shall be granted by the judge of
the district to the accused, for the purpose of arranging his business; and no
more shall be granted to him who has been ordered to produce the defendant.
After he has appeared in court, and an advocate has been appointed to defend
him, the case shall be heard, and, whether the guilt or the innocence of the
accused is established, he and his prosecutor must be treated in the same
manner, without any distinction.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Kalendsof January, during the
Consulate of Gratian, Consul for the fifth time, and Theodosius.
3. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosii, and Arcadius to Dre-panius, Proconsul
of Africa.
We order that no one shall be produced in court unless the judge has directed
that this shall be done.
Given at Milan, on the Nonesof February, during the Consulate of Valentinian,
Consul for the third time, and Neoterius, 390.
TITLE IV. CONCERNING THE CUSTODY OF ACCUSED PERSONS.
1. The Emperor Constantius to Florentinus.
As soon as the defendant is produced in any case, whether an accuser is
responsible for his appearance, or whether a public official has caused his
arrest, his trial must at once proceed, so that if he is guilty, he may be
punished, and if he is innocent, he may be discharged.
When the accuser is absent, or the presence of the accomplices of the accused
is considered necessary, they should be found as soon as possible. In the
meantime, however, handcuffs should not be placed on the defendant, which bind
him closely, but he should be placed in longer chains (if the nature of the
offence demands the harshness of chains); so that he may not be subjected to
suffering, but still remain in safe custody. He should not, however, be
confined in a dark dungeon, but where he can be reached by light, and enjoy it;
and, as night demands double vigilance, he ought to be lodged in the vestibule
of a prison, or some other healthy place, and, when day returns, he should
immediately be brought out into the light, as soon as the sun rises, in order
that he may not die through imprisonment, which is considered unfortunate in
the case of innocent persons, but not sufficiently severe so far as those who
are guilty are concerned.
The following rule must also be observed, namely, that it shall not be lawful
for those who perform the duties of jailers, or their attendants, to sell their
cruelty to accusers, by destroying innocent persons through confinement in
narrow dungeons, or, by delaying the hearing of their cases, cause them to
waste away with disease; for a judge is not only liable to loss of reputation,
but he will also incur serious risk if he does not punish with the penalty of
death any jailer or his attendants, who, through negligence, or for any other
reason whatever, permit anyone to remain in prison a longer time than he
should, or to punish by starvation.
Given on the day before the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of
Constantine, Consul for the sixth time, and the Caesar Constantius, 353.
2. The Same Emperor and Csesar to Evagrius, Prsetorian Prefect.
Where anyone is accused of such an offence or crime as to render him worthy of
being confined in a filthy and narrow cell, he shall be publicly heard, and it
must be decided whether he is liable to imprison-
ment, and afterwards, if it appears probable that he has committed the crime
with which he is charged, he should be conducted back to prison. In this way
information of crimes which have been perpetrated is obtained by testimony
given in public, so that some restraint may be imposed upon judges who are
prone to the exercise of unreasonable severity.
Given at Heraclia, on the third of the Nonesof February, during the Consulate
of Constantine, Consul for the seventh time, and the Caesar Constantius, Consul
for the second time, 354.
3. The Same Emperor to Acindynus, Prietorian Prefect.
As the same prison is ordinarily used for the confinement of criminals of both
sexes, We decree, by this law, that even if the nature of the punishment
requires that those of both sexes should be incarcerated together, still it is
ordered that males and females shall not be placed in the same cells.
Given on the Nonesof April, during the Consulate of Acindynus and Proculus,
340.
Extract from Novel 134, Chapter IX. Latin Text,
At present, under the new law, We do not permit any woman to be sent to prison,
locked up, or placed in custody, on account of money due the Treasury, or in
any civil case, or for the commission of any crime; but if an action has been
brought against her to collect a debt due to the Treasury, or to a private
individual, she can legally answer by her husband, or by anyone else. Where,
however, he either refuses to answer, or to conduct her case, execution can be
issued against her property. If the offence is of such a character as to
require her to be placed in custody, and she can furnish a surety, he shall be
responsible for her appearance. If she should swear that she cannot furnish a
surety, she can take the oath to appear in court when called upon to do so.
If the crime of which she is accused is of the most serious description, she
shall be placed in a monastery, or a nunnery, or delivered up to certain women
by whom she shall be guarded.
When judges who do not observe these rules are of superior rank, they shall pay
a fine of twenty pounds of gold, and if they are of inferior station they shall
pay a fine of ten. Their subordinates, who have failed to discharge their duty
in the cases above mentioned, shall be deprived of their offices and sent into
exile.
4. The Emperors Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian to Probus, Pr&-torian Prefect.
The custody and care of imprisoned persons devolves upon the jailer, who must
not think that some abject and vile dependent will be responsible, if a
prisoner should, in any way escape, for We desire that he himself shall suffer
the same penalty to which the prisoner who escaped is shown to have been
liable.
When, however, the jailer is necessarily absent from his post, We order that
his assistant shall be bound to exercise the same vigilance, and shall be
punished with the same severity.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Gratian,
Consul for the fifth time, and Probus, 371.
5. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Eutro-pius, Prietorian
Prefect.
We clearly and definitely decree that persons who are in prison shall, if
convicted, immediately suffer the penalty to which they are sentenced, or that,
having been discharged, they shall not be oppressed by further confinement.1
We also decree that the jailer shall, every thirty days, make a statement of
the number of prisoners in his custody, the nature of their different offences,
and the rank and age of the prisoners.
If he should fail to do this, We order that he shall pay twenty pounds of gold
to Our Treasury, and We decree that a negligent judge, or one who has only
manifested weakness and is unfitted for the office which he has obtained, shall
be fined ten pounds of gold.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Kalendsof January, during the
Consulate of Gratian, Consul for the fifth time, and Theodosius, 380.
6. This Law is not Authentic.
TITLE V. CONCERNING THE PROHIBITION OF PRIVATE PRISONS.
1. The Emperor Zeno to Ba^ilius, Prsetorian Prefect.
We order that no one whosoever shall, under any circumstances, be permitted to
have a private prison either in the magnificent city of Alexandria, or in the
province of Egypt, or in any other part of Our Empire, or on his own land or in
any of his houses, and We direct the illustrious Augustal Prefect, and the
distinguished Governors of all the provinces, in the future to use every effort
possible to repress the repeatedly mentioned insolence of unprincipled men who
are guilty of such an offence. For, by this most salutary law, the eminent
Augustal Prefect and the Governors of provinces shall unquestionably incur the
penalty of high treason, if, having learned that a crime of this kind has been
committed, they do not vindicate the offended majesty of the Emperor.
Moreover, all high officials are rendered liable to punishment for treason if,
as soon as they have ascertained that this prohibited offence has been
committed anywhere, they do not, at once, inform the judges under their
jurisdiction, in order that the said atrocious crime may be
1 Imprisonment was not a penalty among the Romans, but merely a means to insure
the safe-keeping of a defendant, "Career ad homines custodiendos, non ad
puniendos, dari debet."ED.
punished; for it is clear that those who have committed a crime of this kind
should be subjected to the extreme penalty, not only in accordance with the
provisions of the ancient laws and constitutions, but also as guilty of high
treason.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of
Longinus, 486.

not annulled, so far as you are concerned, as you state that his wife, as well
as yourself, has also been accused of complicity in the same offence.
Published on the seventh of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of
Lsetus, Consul for the second time, and Cerealis, 216.
3. The Same Emperor to Proculus.
If he whom you have accused of homicide, or of any other offence whatsoever, is
dead, proceedings instituted against you for having abandoned the accusation
will be without effect, as both the crime and the penalty are extinguished by
death; and, for the same reason, the necessity of proceeding with the
accusation is no longer imposed upon you.
Published at Rome, on the fourth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate
of Sabinus and Anulinus.
4. The Emperor Alexander to Veronitianus.
If, as you allege, you are interested in a case involving the payment of money,
although Annianus, whom your agent accused of forgery, is dead, you will not be
prevented from bringing an accusation, if anyone should avail himself of the
instrument, which is of doubtful validity, against you; for although the
offence has been extinguished by the death of the principal, and can no longer
exist, still, if anyone wishes to make use of the forged instrument, he must
understand that he is liable to punishment for doing so.
Published on the sixth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Albinus and ^milianus, 228.
5. The Emperor Gordian to Rufus.
It is a well-known rule of law that, where persons accused of the commission of
public crimes, whether they themselves have perpetrated them or have ordered
others to do so, die while the accusation is pending, their heirs will not be
excluded from their estates, unless they have committed suicide.
Published on the seventh of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of
Pius and Pontianus, 239.
6. The Same Emperor to Julianus.
If anyone condemned to death or deportation should take an appeal, and die
before it has been determined, the crime is extinguished by his death. The same
rule shall be observed if the accuser should die while the appeal is pending.
If, however, the culprit should be sentenced to the penalty of relegation, and
to the loss of a part of his property, and should have recourse to appeal, the
appeal must, nevertheless, be heard and decided even after his death; as it is
proper to ascertain whether the confiscation of his property was valid or not.

and Aviola, 240.
TITLE VII. WHERE ANYONE REVILES THE EMPEROR.
1. The Emperors Theodosius, Arcadius, and Honorius to Rufinus, Prsetorian
Prefect.
Where anyone, ignorant of modesty and without any sense of shame, thinks Our
name should be attacked with dishonorable and petulant abuse, or if rendered
turbulent by drunkenness, he should manifest discontent with the proceedings of
Our reign, We are unwilling for him to be subjected to any penalty, nor do We
desire that he be treated with severity or harshness; since if this was the
result of levity, he is only worthy of contempt; if it was caused by insanity,
he is an object of pity; and if it was done for the purpose of injury, he
should be pardoned.
Wherefore, let any occurrence of this kind be, without reservation, brought to
Our knowledge, in order that We may consider what has been said, and determine
whether it should be passed over in silence, or investigated.
Given at Constantinople, on the sixth of the Idesof August, during the
Consulate of Theodosius, Consul for the third time, and Abun-dantius, 392.
TITLE Vill.
ON THE LEX JULIA RELATING TO TREASON. 1. The Emperor Alexander to Paulinus.
You are not only not permitted to accuse a judge of the crime of treason,
because you allege that he has rendered a decision against
Our Constitution, but I do not wish accusations of this crime to be made during
My reign on any other grounds whatever.
Published on the third of the Idesof April, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and Julianus, 224.
2. The Same Emperor to Faustinianus.
You entertain a singular idea of My disposition when, having in a moment of
anger and without reflection sworn by the name of the Emperor that you would
always treat your slave with severity, you think that you will be guilty of
treason if you do not continue to do so:
Published on the third of the Nonesof February, during the Consulate of Julian,
Consul for the second time, and Crispinus, 225.
3. The Emperor Constantine to Maximus, Prefect of the City.
If one person should accuse another of the crime of treason, he who is accused,
no matter what his rank or privileges may be, cannot protect himself from
torture, and whoever brings the accusation is hereby notified that he also
shall be put to the question (if he should be unable to prove his charge by
convincing evidence) along with the person accused of a crime of this kind. He
also, by whose advice and instigation the accusation appears to have been made,
must be subjected to torture, in order that punishment may be inflicted upon
all persons guilty of complicity in the offence.
Published on the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of Volusianus and
Annianus, 314.
4. The Emperors Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian to Olybrius, Prefect of the
City.
No one, under any circumstances, shall be forbidden to make use of any defence,
either that of military service, or of any order to which he may belong, or of
his family, to escape torture, without our knowledge and consent, where such
defence is proper, except solely in cases of treason, in which the condition of
all persons is considered to be equal.1
Given on the eighth of July, during the Consulate of the Noble Prince
Valentinian and Victor, 369.
5. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Eutychianus, Prsetorian Prefect.
Anyone who joins an infamous faction composed of either soldiers, private
persons, or barbarians, whether he himself, as its head, receives the oath, or
takes it as an individual, shall be put to death as
1 Among nations who recognized the Lex Talionis,homicide of the sovereign did
not constitute treason, as we understand it, for the offence was a private one
to be atoned for by blood-revenge, or by the payment of a fixed pecuniary fine
in lieu thereof. This was the rule among the early Anglo-Saxons. "Even in the
case of the murder of the king, the State did not take up the matter, but left
it to the royal kindred to obtain redress by private feud, as in other cases.
There could be no such thing as crime under these conditions, as in no case did
the State act to
guilty of high treason, and all his property shall be confiscated to Our
Treasury, whether he has plotted the death of illustrious men who are members
of Our Council and Consistory, and of the Senate (as they form part of Our
government), or finally, of anyone else who is in Our service; for the laws
punish with equal severity the intention to commit a crime and its actual
perpetration.
(1) The sons of a person convicted of such an offense, to whom by special
Imperial indulgence We grant the privilege of life (for they should be put to
death by the same punishment as their father, as in their cases his example,
that is the inclination to commit a crime, is inherited) shall be excluded from
the estates and successions of their mothers and grandmothers, and all their
remaining nearest relatives.
Nor shall they be able to receive anything under the wills of strangers, but
shall always remain in want, and poor; and the infamy of their fathers will
always attach to them, nor shall they afterwards be eligible to any office, or
be qualified to perform public duties; in short, such men shall remain in such
a condition of perpetual indigence that death will be a consolation to them,
and life a punishment.
(2) Finally, We order that those persons who attempt to intercede with Us for
criminals of this kind shall not be pardoned, no matter what their rank may be.
(3) Again, We decree that the children of such persons, whatever may be their
number, shall only be entitled to the Falcidian portion out of the estate of
their mother, whether she left a will or died intestate ; so that the daughters
may only have a moderate sum for their support, rather than the entire benefit
and name of heirs. The rule, when applicable to them, should be enforced with
moderation, as We think that they are less venturesome on account of the
weakness of their sex.
(4) Emancipations granted by the persons aforesaid, either in favor of their
sons or daughters, after the commission of the crime,
redress a wrong against itself." (Barrell, An Outline of Anglo-Saxon Law, Page
52.)
The Welsh did not permit the payment of money by way of compromise under such
circumstances. "There are three persons who forfeit their lives, and who cannot
be bought off: a traitor to the country and the tribe; he that kills another
from real malice; and a convicted thief for the value of more than four-pence."
(The Ancient Laws of Cambria, Triads of Dyvenwal Moelmud, Page 57.)
The disabilities resulting from the commission of treason are set forth as
follows in the old English law:
"In treason, there ensueth a corruption of blood in the line ascending and
descending.
"In treason, lands and goods are forfeited, and inheritances, as well intailed
asfee-simple, and the profits of estates for life.
"In treason there be no accessaries, but all are principals.
"In treason, no benefit of clergy, or sanctuary, or peremptory challenge.
"In treason, if the party stand mute, yet nevertheless judgment and attainder
shall proceed all one as upon verdict.
"In treason, bail is not permitted.
"In treason, no counsel is to be allowed to the party.
"In treason, no witness shall be received upon oath for the party's
justification." (Bacon, Works, A Preparation for the Union of Laws, Page
292.)ED.
are not valid. We also decree that all dowries, donations, and, finally, all
alienations of any kind of property whatsoever, which it is established were
made after the time when the person implicated decided to join the faction and
association aforesaid, whether they were fraudulently or legally effected,
shall be of no force or effect.
(5) The wives of the above-mentioned criminals shall recover their dowries, if
any property received from their husbands by way of donation was given on
condition that it should be reserved for their children; and they are notified
that all of said property to which the sons may be entitled by law must be left
to Our Treasury, and that the Falcidian portion of the same shall be considered
to have been only reserved for the daughters, and not for the sons.
(6) We direct that what We have provided with reference to the aforesaid
offenders and their children shall also apply to their followers, associates,
and attendants; and We decree that their sons and their abettors shall be
treated with the same severity.
(7) If any one of these persons, at the very beginning of the organization of
the faction, being animated by a praiseworthy intention, should betray the
conspiracy, he shall be honored and rewarded by Us. He, however, who becomes
implicated, and afterwards reveals the secrets of the conspirators, unknown up
to that time, shall be considered worthy of absolution and pardon.
Given on the day before the Nonesof September, during the Consulate of
Csesarius and Atticus, 397.
6. This Law is not Authentic.
7. Paulus, On Public Crimes.
It should be remembered that, where any act is alleged to have been committed
against the majesty of the Emperor, it is customary for the crime to be
prosecuted even after the death of the culprit, since the Divine Marcus ordered
the property of the Senator Druncianus, who was the accomplice of Cassianus in
his conspiracy, to be confiscated to the Treasury after his death; and, during
Our reign, many heirs have been deprived of their right to estates under
similar circumstances.
(1) Moreover, in a crime of this kind, involving the majesty of the Emperor,
slaves are tortured to obtain evidence against their masters.
8. Martianus on Criminal Prosecutions, Book I, Title: "On the Lex Julia,
Relating to the Offence of High Treason."
After the enactment of the Constitution of the Divine Marcus, We have adopted
the rule that the accusation of this crime can be made even after the decease
of the culprits, so that, if the offender should be convicted after his death,
his memory may be condemned to infamy, and his heir deprived of his estate; for
in this way a person who has conceived such a wicked design is considered to
have been punished from that very moment.1 Thus the Divine Severus and
Antoninus
1 The general rule of the Civil Law, however, expressly stated that the mere
planning of an illegal act did not involve liability to criminal prosecution.
This
decided that, from the instant when a man became guilty of an offence of this
kind, he could neither alienate property nor manumit anyone, and that no one
could legally pay him a debt. The Great Antoninus stated the same thing in a
rescript. Under such circumstances, that is to say, where treason is involved,
slaves are put to the question to obtain evidence against their masters.
If the person implicated should die before his case has been decided, his
property must be deposited under seal, on account of the uncertainty of his
successor; as the Emperors Severus and Antoninus stated in rescripts addressed
to the Receivers of the Treasury.

TITLE IX.
ON THE LEX JULIA RELATING TO ADULTERY AND FORNICATION.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Cassia.
The Lex Juliadeclares that wives have no right to bring criminal accusations
for adultery against their husbands, even though they may desire to complain of
the violation of the marriage vow, for while the law grants this privilege to
men it does not concede it to women.
Published on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of
Lateranus and Rufinus, 198.
2. The Same Emperors to Cyrus.
Those are guilty of the crime of pimping who allow their wives taken in
adultery to remain in marriage, and not those who merely suspect their wives of
having committed adultery.
Published on the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Anulinus and Fronto,
200.
3. The Emperor Antoninus to Julianus.
Not only the words of the Lex Juliaconcerning the repression of adultery, but
also the spirit of the law, authorize a husband who desires to prove that his
wife has been guilty of adultery to do so by torturing slaves of both sexes;
and this applies only to the slaves of the persons specially mentioned in the
law, that is to say, the woman, and her natural, not her adoptive father; and
it forbids the said slaves to be either manumitted or sold within the term of
sixty days, to be computed from the date of the dissolution of the marriage,
and requires the husband to furnish a bond to the owners of said slaves to
indemnify them, if the former should die under torture, or become deteriorated
in value, and the woman be acquitted.
was not the case with the early Scotch Code, Regiam Majestatem,said to have
been practically copied from Glanvil's treatise, and which declared that the
more serious offences, such as treason, homicide, arson, robbery, rape, and
forgery, "may be punished not only for any fact or deed, but also for the
intent and purpose." (Regiam Majestatem,I, I.)ED.
Published on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of
Antoninus, Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
4. The Emperor Alexander to Julian, Proconsul of the Province of Narbonne.
If Numerius, who killed Gracchus at night in the act of adultery, did so under
such circumstances that he could have taken his life with impunity by virtue of
the Lex Julia,what was lawfully done will incur no penalty.
The same rule applies to sons who have obeyed the orders of their father, in a
case of this kind. If, however, the husband, rendered insane by grief, killed
the adulterer without being legally authorized to do so, even though the
homicide may have been excusable, still, because it was committed at night, and
his just grief diminished the criminality of the act, he can be sent into
exile.
Without date or designation of Consulate.
5. The Same Emperor to Vadantus.
An adulterer cannot be accused after the lapse of five years from the time when
the offence is said to have been committed, and these must be reckoned
continuously, for the guilty party must not be deprived of the benefit of the
prescription allowed by the laws.
Published on the Idesof June, during the Consulate of Maximus, Consul for the
second time, and Julianus, 224.
6. The Same Emperor to Sebastian.
Sixty available days are granted by law to a husband desiring to bring an
accusation of adultery, during which he will be allowed to do so either against
the adulterer or adulteress. If this term should elapse, the husband can still
proceed under the law conceding this right to strangers. He who brings an
accusation of this kind should have no fear of the penalty for malicious
prosecution, for My Divine relatives, the Emperors, have permitted the torture
of slaves to establish proof of the crime in the same way as in the case of a
husband.
Published on the second of the Idesof August, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and ^lianus, 224.
7. The Same Emperor to Heruclanus.
The man who afterwards married her cannot be a lawful accuser, where an adult
virgin was violated before her marriage; and therefore he cannot prosecute the
crime as her husband, unless he was betrothed to the girl who was violated. If,
however, she herself, with the assistance of her curators by whom her affairs
were transacted, should prosecute for the injury committed upon her, the
Governor of the province will impose a severe sentence in accordance with what
is required by law for a crime of this kind, if its commission should be
established.
Published on the twelfth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of
Maximus, Consul for the second time, and ^Elianus, 224.
8. The Same Emperor to Domnus.
The Lex Juliarelating to chastity forbids the two parties guilty of adultery,
that is to say, the man and the woman, to be prosecuted at the same time, and
in the same case, but they can both be prosecuted in succession.
Published on the Idesof June, during the Consulate of Julian, Consul for the
second time, and Crispinus, 225.
9. The Same Emperor to Proculus.
It is proper for the preservation of virtue during My reign that a woman
convicted under the Lex Juliaconcerning chastity should suffer the legal
penalty.
Moreover, anyone that knowingly marries, or takes back a woman convicted of
adultery, who has in some way evaded the penalty prescribed for her crime,
shall be punished by the same law as a procurer.
Published on the seventh of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of
Julian, Consul for the second time, and Crispinus, 225.
10. The Same Emperor to Demetrianus.
It is not lawful to condone the crime of adultery, and he who is guilty of
collusion is in the same position as one who refuses to reveal the truth.
Moreover, he who accepts a sum of money to desist from prosecution, in a case
where adultery has been discovered, is liable to the penalty imposed by the Lex
Julia.
Published on the fifth of the Nones ofMay, during the Consulate of Fuscus and
Dexter, 226.
11. The Same Emperor to Narvanus.
No one doubts that a husband cannot accuse his wife of adultery if he continues
to retain her in marriage.
Published on the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of Alexander, Consul
for the second time, and Marcellus, 227.
Extract from Novel 117, Chapter XVIII. Latin Text.
Under the new law, however, he can do so, and if the accusation is proved to be
true, he can then repudiate her, and he should file a written accusation
against her. If, however, the husband should not be able to establish the
accusation of adultery which he brought, he will be liable to the same
punishment which his wife would have undergone if the accusation had been
proved.
12. The Same Emperor to Bassus.
Although, as you allege, he who was convicted of the crime of adultery was not
restored to his civil rights; still, since your sister, with whom the adultery
was said to have been committed, was not accused, she could not have been
subjected to any penalty, or rendered infamous, especially as you state that
the accuser afterwards died.
Published on the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of Sabinus, Consul for
the second time, and Venustus, 241. T*U
13. The Same Emperor to Sylvanus.
It is an established rule of law that, if the adulteress, after the accusation
has been brought against her, should leave the province, she can still be
prosecuted while absent.
Published on the Nonesof March, during the Consulate of Atticus and
Prsetextatus, 243.
14. The Emperor Gordian to Aquila.
If your wife should be guilty of adultery during marriage, you ought to
prosecute her in the ordinary manner, in the province in which the adultery was
committed. If she committed adultery and married again after you repudiated
her, you cannot accuse her, unless the notice of the accusation preceded her
second marriage.
Published on the Nonesof December, during the Consulate of Gordian and Aviola,
240.
15. The Same Emperor to the Soldier Hilarinus.
If your former wife, before having been accused of adultery, left the province,
she cannot be accused while absent; nor can the complaint be legally made or
filed in the province in which you were serving as a soldier. Although you will
not be permitted to do this while you are in the military service, you can
accuse her afterwards, by observing the usual formalities; for the time during
which you were performing your duties as a soldier should not deprive you of
the vengeance which you demand for the suffering inflicted upon you as a
husband.
Published on the fourth of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Atticus
and Praitextatus, 243.
Extract from Novel 134, Chapter V. Latin Text.
If the person guilty of adultery should conceal himself, or should leave the
province in which the crime was committed, We order that he shall be summoned
by the judge as legally required; and if he does not appear, the proceedings
prescribed by Our laws shall be instituted against him. When, however, it is
ascertained that he is living in another province, We order the judge of the
province in which the crime was committed to send a public letter to the judge
of the one in which the delinquent resides. He who receives the said public
letter shall arrest the culprit, and send him to the judge of the province in
which he perpetrated the offence, to undergo the penalty provided by law, or
run the risk of losing his office.
If, however, he who received the public letter aforesaid should neglect to do
this, or his subordinate officer should fail to discharge the duties imposed
upon him, We decree that the judge himself shall be fined three pounds of gold,
and his subordinate an equal sum. But when the judge, or any of his
subordinates, in consideration of money paid, do not arrest the offender, or
if, having arrested him, do not bring him into the other province, he who is
convicted of having done this shall be deprived of. his office and sent into
exile.
16. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus to Archesilaus.
You should appear before the Governor in whose tribunal you have filed your
accusation of adultery, if you desire it to be dismissed; but you are mistaken
if you think that this can be done without making application to the court, and
that, afterwards, you will not be liable to the penalty prescribed by the
Decree of the Senate, for the Emperors have frequently decided the contrary.
And you are also notified that, hereafter, you will not have the power to make
accusations of this kind; because, by a Decree of the Senate and the Lex
Petronia,he who has filed an accusation for adultery and did not prosecute it
shall never again be permitted to bring one for this offence.
Published on the fifth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of Maximus
and Glabrio, 257.
17. The Same Emperors to Victorinus.
You can resume marital relations with your wife without fear of being liable to
the penalty prescribed by the Lex Julia,for the suppression of adultery, as you
did nothing more than file the written accusation, for the reason that you
assert that you afterwards ascertained that you were impelled by groundless
indignation to accuse her; for he alone will be liable to the penalty
specifically mentioned by the law who is aware that his wife has been publicly
convicted of adultery, or that she is an adulteress, as he cannot simulate
ignorance of the fact, and retain her as his wife.
Published on the sixth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of the
Emperor Valerian, Consul for the fourth time, and Gallienus, Consul for the
third time, 258.
18. The Same Emperors and the Csesar Valerian to Theodora.
There is no doubt that he who has two wives at once is branded with infamy,
for, in a case of this kind, not the operation of the law by which Our citizens
are forbidden to contract more than one marriage at a time, but the intention,
should be considered; and therefore he who pretended to be unmarried, but had
another wife in the province, and asked you to marry him, can lawfully be
accused of the crime of fornication, for which you are not liable, for the
reason that you thought that you were his wife. You can obtain from the
Governor of the province the return of all your property of which you deplore
the loss on account of the fraudulent marriage, and which should be restored to
you without delay. But how can you recover what he promised to give you as his
betrothed ?
Adopted at Antioch, on the Idesof May, during the Consulate of Tuscus and
Bassus, 259.
19. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Pompeianus.
Although it is an undoubted rule of law that, whenever an accusation of
adultery is made, the presence of the accuser is required, still, as We have
learned from your letters that Materia, the wife of
Propositus, who was absent on a journey, was convicted of adultery with Julian
after her slaves had been put to torture; and that, when sentence was about to
be passed upon her, she demanded that her husband should be present, as the
case was almost terminated, and the crime in question had been proved, We do
not think that Propositus should be recalled from a distance.
Given on the Nonesof December, during the Consulate of the above-mentioned
Emperors.
20. The Same Emperors and Cassars to Didymus.
The laws punish the detestable wickedness of women who prostitute their
chastity to the lusts of others, but does not hold those liable who are
compelled to commit fornication through force, and against their will. And,
moreover, it has very properly been decided that their reputations are not
lost, and that their marriage with others should not be prohibited on this
account.

Diocletian, Consul for the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third
time, 290.
21. The Same Emperors and Cassars to Silanus.
Although certain times have been prescribed by law with reference to the
commission of adultery, and the accusing of wives, which times must be properly
computed, still, if you were unable to file an accusation on account of your
having a public employment, and the prescribed term expired before you
relinquished your office, you have full power to bring the accusation after you
have done so. You should, however, not delay after you have vacated the office;
nor should you, for the purpose of terrifying your adversary, make a pretence
of bringing an accusation with unrestrained impetuosity.

Diocletian, Consul for the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third

22. The Same Emperors and Cassars to Oblimosus.
If a woman whom you have carnally known indiscriminately sold herself for
money, and prostituted herself everywhere as a harlot, you did not commit the
crime of adultery with her.
Published on the twelfth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of
Diocletian, Consul for the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third
time, 290.
23. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Proculus.
Slaves cannot accuse their wives of adultery for violation of conjugal faith.
(1) Again, where a man has legally married a wife after she has been divorced,
and, through fear of an accusation which had been filed, as well as of the
influence of the former husband, gave gold and silver to the accuser; he can
appear before the Governor, not only for
the purpose of recovering the property, but also to punish the base desire for
gain; and, after the allegations of the parties have been heard, and the truth
of the matter inquired into, if he should ascertain that anything had been
given by the innocent party on account of the fear of prosecution for crime, he
must render his decision accordingly, and in compliance with what has been
provided by law.
When, however, it is established that the money was paid as a consideration for
dishonorable marriage, and for the purpose of obtaining immunity, he will order
that the person who received the money in violation of the Decree of the
Senate, in such a detestable transaction, shall be punished.

24. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Dionysii.
If you should be accused of adultery by her with whom you have lived in
violation of law, you can defend yourself by an innumerable number of
expedients.
25. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Sossianus.
Although it is established by the contents of certain documents that you are
consumed with the lust of immoderate desire, still, as it has been ascertained
that you confined yourself to female slaves, and did not have intercourse with
free women, it is clear that by a sentence of this kind your reputation
suffers, rather than that you become infamous.
Published on the fifth of the Idesof March, during the Consulship of Tiberianus
and Dio, 291.
26. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Crispinus.
As Alexander, who was accused of the crime of adultery, pleaded an exception on
the ground that the accuser, after the adultery was discovered, kept his wife
with him, We think that his status should now be investigated, and the order of
the proceeding be reversed, so that, in the first place, inquiry should be made
as to the civil condition of Alexander; and if, after having heard the case,
you should ascertain that he is free, you can authorize him to plead the
exception.
If, however, you should find that he is a slave, all the impediments caused by
the exception having been removed, you must immediately punish the accusation
of adultery, and if you find him guilty, impose the penalty which the laws have
prescribed for the offence.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
27. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Phoebus.
Adultery committed with a man whom a woman afterwards married is not
extinguished by the fact of the marriage.
Published on the eighteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
the Caesars.
28. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Concordius, Proconsul of ffumidia.
Our respect for chastity is such that We have determined to remove the
ambiguities of former laws, and decide with reference to the trial for
adultery; all exceptions having been abolished, except that based on
prescription of five years; the one relative to pimping, which can be pleaded
against the husband; and that of which the woman can avail herself after the
former marriage has been dissolved, and before notice has been served upon her
not to contract a second one, namely, that her accomplice in the crime be
prosecuted; for it is unworthy that legal technicalities should prevent the
punishment of violated chastity.
Published on the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of Tuscus and Anulinus,

29. The Emperor Constantine to Africanus.
It should be ascertained whether the woman who committed adultery was the owner
of the inn, or only a servant; and if, by employing herself in servile duties
(which frequently happens), she gave occasion for intemperance, since if she
were the mistress of the inn, she will not be exempt from liability under the
law.
Where, however, she served liquor to the men who were drinking, she would not
be liable to accusation as having committed the offence, on account of her
inferior rank, and any freemen who have been accused shall be discharged, as
the same degree of modesty is required of these women as of those who are
legally married, and bear the name of mothers of families.
Those, also, are not subject to judicial severity who are guilty of fornication
or adultery, and the vileness of whose lives does not render them worthy of the
attention of the laws.
Signed and given at Heraclia, on the third of the Nonesof February, during the
Consulate of Constantine, Consul for the seventh time, and the Caesar
Constantius, 326.
30. The Same Emperor to Evagrius.
Although the crime of adultery is included among public offences, the
accusation of which is granted to all persons without distinction, still, in
order that those who inconsiderately wish to cause discord in households may
not be allowed to do so, it is hereby decreed that only the nearest relatives
of the guilty party shall have the power to bring the accusation; that is to
say, the father, the brother, and the paternal and maternal uncles, whom
genuine grief may impel to prosecute. We, however, also give the said persons
permission to revoke the accusation, by withdrawing it, if they should so
desire.
The husband, above all others, should be considered the avenger of the marriage
bed, for he is permitted to accuse his wife on suspicion, and he is not
forbidden to retain her, if he only suspects her; nor will he be liable if he
files a written accusation when he accuses her as her husband, a privilege
which was established by former Emperors.
Moreover, We decree that strangers shall be prevented from bringing such
charges, for although every kind of accusation renders the person who makes it
in writing liable in case it should not be proved, still, some persons boldly
make them and disturb marriages with false denunciations.
Those who have violated the sanctity of marriage should be punished with death.
Published at Nicomedia, on the seventh of the Kalendsof May, during the
Consujate of Constantine, Consul for the seventh time, and the Caesar
Constantius, Consul for the fourth time, 326.
Extract from Novel 134, Chapter X. Latin Text.
At present, however, a woman convicted of adultery is placed in a monastery,
from which her husband is permitted to remove her within the term of two years.
After the two years have expired, without her husband having taken her back,
or, before that, if he should have died, the adulteress, having had her head
shaved, and assumed a religious habit, shall remain there during lifetime, and
her property, if she has any, shall be divided into three parts, two of which
should be given to her children, and the third to the monastery. When she has
no children, and her parents are living and did not consent to her crime, they
shall receive a third part of her property, and the monastery two-thirds of the
same. If her aforesaid relatives are not living, all of her property shall be
acquired by her monastery, and, in every instance, all rights under dotal
agreements are reserved for the benefit of the husband.
Extract from Novel 117, Chapter XV. Latin Text.
If anyone should notify a man, whom he suspects of being intimate with his
wife, three times in writing, in the presence of three witnesses who are worthy
of confidence, to discontinue his relations with her, and afterwards should
surprise him with his wife, either in his own house, or in hers, or in that of
the adulterer, or in a tavern, or in a garden, he can kill her without any risk
to himself. If he should find him anywhere else, he must bring him with three
witnesses before the judge who will have a right to punish him without any
further proceedings.
If, however, after having been notified three times, as above stated, the
parties should be found talking together in a church, the husband can deliver
both to the defender of the church, or to any other members of the clergy, with
the understanding that they must be individually responsible for their custody
until the judge having jurisdiction shall order the bishop of the diocese to
produce the said persons before him, so that they may be put to torture, and
notice be given by him to the Governor of the province, who will impose the
penalty prescribed by law.
31. The Emperors Constantine and Constans to the People.When a man marries, and
his wife becomes pregnant, what can be desired of the woman when her sex is
lost sight of; when what it is of
no advantage to know becomes a crime; when the sexual act assumes another form;
when love is sought, but does not appear? We order the laws to rise up, and
justice to be armed with the avenging sword, that the severest penalty may be
visited upon those who are now, or shall hereafter, be guilty of this infamous
offence.
Given at Milan, on the day before the Nonesof December, and published at Rome
on the seventeenth of the Kalends ofJanuary, during the Consulate of
Constantine, Consul for the ninth time, and Constans.
32. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Cynegius,
Prsetorian Prefect.
In an investigation of adultery, inquiry must be made without excepting any of
all the slaves belonging, not only to the husband, but also to the wife, who
are alleged to have been in the house at the time when the adultery was
committed.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Idesof December, during the
Consulate of Arcadius and Bauto, 385.
33. The Emperors Theodosius, Arcadius, and Honorius to Rufinus, Prsetorian
Prefect.
When a charge of adultery has been made, We order that all civil exceptions by
means of which a dowry may be claimed, or any other debt demanded, and which
are ordinarily pleaded and examined, to be set aside, and that the progress of
the case shall not be delayed through their interposition. But when the
accusation has been formulated, that is to say, when it has been regularly
instituted, whether it was filed under the right of a husband, or under that of
a stranger, the crime shall be investigated, the evidence produced, the more
important matters in dispute settled, and all civil actions be subordinated to
the criminal prosecution. The woman will afterwards have the right to begin any
civil proceedings to which he is entitled, provided they do not interfere with
the conduct of the criminal case.
Given at Constantinople, on the seventh of the Idesof December, during the
Consulate of Arcadius, Consul for the second time, and Rufinus, 392.
34. The Same Emperors to Rufinus, Prsetorian Prefect.
Where persons accused of adultery repel the accusation under the pretext of
relationship, stating that, for this reason, allegations relating to commission
of the crime ought not to be believed, or that it was impossible that it should
have been committed, and they are afterwards married, the offence of which they
were accused shall, merely by this fact, be considered to have been proved
clearly and by legal evidence. Therefore, if any such persons should be met
with, We order that they shall be severely punished, just as if they had been
convicted of the crime, and had confessed it.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Nonesof December, during the
Consulate of Theodosius, Consul for the third time, and Abundantius, 393.
35. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Palladius, Praetorian Prefect.
If a woman should repudiate her husband without any legal reason having been
assigned by her for so doing, We grant the repudiated husband permission to
accuse her, if she should stain her widowhood with acts of debauchery.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Eustachius
and Agricola, 421.
36. The Emperor Justinian to John, Praztorian Prefect.
Former legislators have directed that the freedom of slaves, who belong either
to the wife, the husband, or their parents, in case of the repudiation of
either of the parties on account of suspicion of the crime of adultery, shall
remain in suspense for the term of two months, which must be reckoned from the
date of the repudiation, on account of the torture to be inflicted upon them in
case it should be deemed necessary. But, as your wife died after your marriage
was dissolved in the above-mentioned manner, nothing further is stated by the
authorities concerning any additional time during which the slaves shall be
required to remain in their present condition for the reason above mentioned.
It, however, seems to Us to be necessary to fix a certain period in a case of
this kind, with a view to determining the question of dowry, and whether it
should belong to the husband, or be transferred to the heirs of the wife. Hence
We order that, after the death of the wife, another two months shall be added,
so that the above-mentioned slaves may remain together, and the husband have
the power to prove the adultery by them. When the above-mentioned time has
elapsed, the heir of the woman will have permission to grant freedom to the
slaves, unless he was to blame for the husband being prevented from bringing
the accusation of adultery during the term prescribed by law.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifth of the Kalendsof November, after the
Consulate of Lampadius and Orestes, 532.
37. This Law is not Authentic.
TITLE X. WHERE A GUARDIAN CORRUPTS His FEMALE WARD.
1. The Emperor Constantine to Bassus, Vicegerent of Italy.
When a guardian violates the chastity of his female ward, he shall be sentenced
to deportation, and all his property shall be confiscated to the Treasury,
although he must still suffer the penalty which the laws inflict upon
ravishers.
Given at Aquileia, on the day before the Nonesof April, during the Consulate of
Constantine, Consul for the seventh time, and Con-stantius, 326.
TITLE XL
CONCERNING WOMEN WHO COPULATE WITH THEIR OWN SLAVES.
1. The Emperor Constantine to the People.
When a woman is convicted of having secretly had sexual intercourse with her
slave, she shall be sentenced to death, and the rascally slave shall perish by
fire. Every facility for the proof of this crime shall be afforded all persons,
any official can bring the charge, and even the slave-himself shall be
permitted to testify concerning it, and if it should be established, he must be
granted his freedom. Children born of such an union shall be deprived of all
insignia of rank, and shall have nothing but their freedom, nor will they be
entitled to receive anything from the estates of their mothers, as bequests
under her will, either directly or through the intervention of others.
Moreover, the intestate succession of the woman will pass to her legitimate
children, or to her nearest relatives, or to those who are designated by law.
All the property which the slave who was convicted may have been entitled to,
and anything which could, under any circumstances, have been obtained by the
children of this union, as belonging to the woman, can be claimed by the heirs
above mentioned.
Given on the fourth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of Constantine,
Consul for the seventh time, and the Caesar Constan-tius, 326.
TITLE XII.
ON THE LEX JULIA RELATING TO PUBLIC OR PRIVATE VIOLENCE.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Pelitia.
Those who seize the property of a wife on account of a debt of her husband, or
because of some public civil liability which he has incurred, are considered to
have been guilty of violence.
Given at Rome, on the Kalendsof July, during the Second Consulate of Antoninus
and Geta, 206.
2. The Emperor Antoninus to Verus.
If the third part of the property of your guardian, who was convicted under the
Lex Juliarelating to private violence, has been confiscated to the Treasury,
bring an action of guardianship to recover the portion which your guardian
obtained from the Treasury, provided no prescription can be pleaded against
you, for each heir of the estate is liable for his proportionate share.

Antoninus, Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Bianorus.
If, as you allege, your son's betrothed has been taken away from him, or your
son has been shut up, you will not be prevented from bringing an accusation of
violence before the Governor of the province under the provisions of the Lex
Jidia.
Published at Verona, on the eighth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulship
of the above-mentioned Emperors.
4. The Same Emperors and Csssars to Liberating.
If you think that a criminal accusation should be brought on account of the
property carried away by a slave, you should not bring it against the master of
the slave, but against him who you allege committed the offence. But as you
state that you have also been beaten by the said slave Fiscinulus, you can
proceed against his master also (if you think that he should be prosecuted for
private violence under the Lex Julia)before the Governor, who will not be
ignorant in what way punishment should be inflicted, if the crime should be
proved.
5. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Oplo.
Even if a creditor should take possession of land by force, he can be accused
of private violence under the terms of the Lex Julia.
Ordered at Nicomedia, on the sixth of the Idesof December, during the Consulate
of the Csesars.
6. The Emperor Constantine to Catulinus, Proconsul of Africa.
As many crimes are classed under the term "violence," and as force is often
employed against those who resist, and blows are inflicted upon others who
indignantly return them, and murder not infrequently results, it has been
decided that if anyone, either on the side of the person in possession, or on
that of him who rashly attempts to obtain it, should be killed, he must be
punished who attempted to employ force, and was responsible for the injuries of
either party, and he shall not merely be sentenced to relegation, or
deportation to an island, but shall suffer death, and the judgment pronounced
against him shall not be suspended by appeal.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of
Gallicanus, and Bassus, 317.
7. The Same Emperor to Bassus, Prefect of the City.
When anyone asserts that a tract of land, or any other property, belongs to
him, and thinks that he is entitled to restitution of possession of the same,
or institutes civil proceedings to obtain it or brings an accusation of
violence, after having complied with the legal formalities, he is hereby
notified that if he cannot prove the commission of the crime, he shall suffer
the same penalty which the defendant would have undergone, if guilty. But if,
having failed to serve notice upon the party in possession, he should employ
force against him, We order that the case involving violence shall be heard
before any others, and whatever has happened to the party in possession should
be ascertained, so that the right to possession of the property which he lost
may be restored to him; and that, when this has been done, if a criminal
accusation should be brought, the penalty for violence shall not be inflicted,
but the decision of the entire case shall be postponed, so that the principal
matter may be disposed of; and if judgment should be rendered against him, he
shall be deported to an island, after the confiscation of all his property.
Published at Rome, on the day before the Nonesof October, during the Consulate
of Constantine, Consul for the fifth time, and the Caesar Licinius, 319.
8. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Albinus, Prefect of
the City.
We decree that slaves who have been guilty of violence, whether this is proved
by the evidence of witnesses or by their own confessions, and if they have
committed the violence without the knowledge of their masters, shall suffer the
extreme penalty for the offence which they have perpetrated. If, however, they
committed it through fear, or by order of their masters, it is clear that,
according to the Lex Julia,the latter should be declared infamous, and be
deprived of any privileges they enjoy, either on account of their country, or
their birth; and the slaves who are proved to have obeyed such wicked commands
shall, after conviction, be sent to the mines. Vile and degraded persons, as
well as those who have frequently been convicted of having perpetrated acts of
violence, are liable to the same penalty under the Imperial constitutions.
The judge must remember that he will be branded with infamy if he should delay
to pass sentence for the crime of violence, after it has been established
before him; or should refuse to hear the accusation, or should grant immunity
to the offender; or should impose a milder penalty than We have prescribed.
Given at Milan, on the day before the Nonesof March, during the Consulate of
Valentinian, Consul for the fourth time, and Neoterius, 290.
9. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Aurelius, Prsetorian Prefect.
The crime of one who robs, and of one who knowingly retains the stolen
property, are not dissimilar.1
Given on the third of the Nonesof March, during the Consulate of Honorius,
Consul for the tenth time, and Theodosius, Consul for the fifth time, 415.
1The rapinaof the Roman jurisconsults, known to us as highway robbery, was
denned by them to be the open and forcible taking away of personal property
from another against his will, for the sake of gain. "Rei mobilis alienx
ablatio manifesto, et violenta invito domino lucro facienda gratia."The offence
is not included among those enumerated in the Laws of the Twelve Tables, hence,
as it must have existed in all a.ges, it has very plausibly been surmised that
it was orig-
10. The Emperors Leo and Anthemius to Nicostratits, Prsetorian Prefect.
We desire that all persons, both in the towns and in the country, shall be
deprived of permission to harbor thieves, vagabonds, and
inally called furtum manifestum,or manifest theft; especially as there is
nothing in the etymology of the term furtum,which is, in the slightest degree,
suggestive of the concealment which we are accustomed to associate with
larceny. It was specifically created a public offence by the Edict of the
Praetor, and was confined to movables, which alone would admit of
contractatio,or handling (obviously not applicable to real property), which was
declared essential to constitute the crime of furtum,whether manifest or non-
manifest. It differed from manifest theft solely in being accompanied with
violence, and the penalty was the same, namely, quadruple damagesincluding the
article stolento be collected by means of the Actio vi bonorum raptorum.The
practical identity of the offence with manifest theft is also indicated by the
fact that the penal action for the latter could also be brought at the option
of the injured person, a proceeding which was, in some respects, the preferable
one, inasmuch as the claim for damages did not, in this instance, include the
valuation of the property which was the basis of the suit.
The ancient Babylonians punished highway robbery with death, and, in case the
criminal escaped, the district in which it occurred was liable for damages. "If
a man practice brigandage and be captured that man shall be put to death."
"If the brigand be not captured, the man who has been robbed shall, in the
presence of God, make an itemized statement of his loss, and the city and the
governor, in whose province and jurisdiction the robbery was committed, shall
compensate him for whatever he lost." (The Code of Hammurabi 22, 23.)
It was also punished capitally by the Hindus. "Whoever robs on the Highway: The
Magistrate shall cause a Rope to be tied about his Neck, and shall thus deprive
him of life." (Gentoo Code XVII, 3.)
The laws of the Saxons required the return of the stolen goods and the payment
of a fine of sixty shillings. "If anyone within the limits of our realm commit
'reaf-lac' and 'nyd-naeme,' let him give up the 'reaf-lac' and pay LX shillings
as 'wite.'" (Ancient Laws and Institutes of England; The Laws of King Ine, 10.)
"If anyone commit 'reaf-lac' let him give it up, and compensate, and be liable
in his 'wer' to the king." (Ibid.,The Laws of King Canute, 64.)
The early English jurists, who treated robbery as a form of manifest theft,
derived the definition from the Civil Law. "Est etiam quasi furtum, rapina quse
idem est quantum ad nos quod roberia, & est aliud genus eontraotationis contra
voluntatem domini, & similis posna sequitur vtrumque delictum, et vnde prsedo
dieitur fur improbus; quis enim magis contractat rem aliquam inuito domino,
quam ille qui vi rapit?"(Bracton, De Legibus et Consuetudinitus AnglixIII,
150.)
Employment of violence was always indispensable, but taking from the person was
not, if the article was removed from the presence of the injured party against
his consent. Its value was not fixed, as in the case of grand larceny, at a
specified sum, and anything seized under such circumstances, no matter what it
may have been worth, comes within the law. "Robbery est, quant ascun home prent
ascu chose del parson du auter felonisement, in tiel cas coment que la chose
prise ne soit al value forsque dun denier; vncore ceo est felonye, pur quel il
serra pendus."
"Si vn prist ascun de mes chattels apertement deins tiel lieu ou leo suis
preset, & encounter mon gree, que ceo est robbery coment que il ne ceo prist de
man person."(Staundf orde, Les Plees del Cor onI, 10.)
The definition of robbery as given by the old jurisconsults is still accepted
in England. Originally capital, like all serious felonies, it is now punishable
by penal servitude for from five years to life. (VideStephen, A Digest of the
Criminal Law, Arts. 296, 313.)
When this offence is committed, or even an attempt was made to perpetrate it by
a number of armed persons, in China, the penalty is death.
The punishment of individual offenders is usually less severe. The magistrates,
however, are invested with discretionary power, and can inflict a capital
armed fugitive slaves. If anyone, in violation of this law which We have
promulgated for the public welfare, should attempt to entertain armed slaves,
vagabonds, or robbers on his premises, or near his person, We order that he
shall be punished severely, after having been sentenced to pay a fine of a
hundred pounds of gold.
The illustrious Governors of provinces should see that no one dares to violate
this law in any respect, and if they do so knowingly, they shall be stripped of
their rank and office, and, after having been condemned to pay a fine of a
hundred pounds of gold, shall be put to
sentence when there are aggravating circumstances attending the crime, and they
must do so if the victim is wounded. "All persons found guilty of taking
unlawful possession of the property of others, in open day and by forcible
means, shall, however small the amount of the property so taken, be punished
with 100 blows and banishment for three years." (The Penal Code of China, Secs.
CCLXVI, CCLXVIII.)
Japan punishes robbery with imprisonment for not less than three years in
ordinary cases, a term which may extend to five, or even ten years, where
justice seems to demand it. (Penal Code of Japan, Arts. 273, 277, 279.)
The penalties in Germany vary from imprisonment for six months, where
extenuating circumstances exist, to confinement at hard labor for life, where
the crime is of a peculiarly atrocious character. Burglary of an inhabited
building is classed under this head. (Strafgesetzbuch filr das Deutsche
Reich,Secs. 249, 250, 251.)
Austria prescribes imprisonment of from five to twelve years, dependent upon
the conditions under which the crime was perpetrated. The mere display of
violence, without taking the property, is sufficient to incur criminal
liability. (Allge-meines Strafgesetz,Arts. 190, 191, 192, 193.)
The desire of gain is a necessary element of the offence by Spanish law, and
the value of the property involved is an important consideration in passing
sentence. The number of malefactors and the fact that they are armed are
matters of aggravation, in fixing the penalty; which is imprisonment for from
two months and a day to confinement in chains for life. (Codigo Penal de
Espana,Arts. 515-529.)
In Prance, anyone guilty of robbery can be sentenced to hard labor for a term
of years, or for life. (Code Penal,Art. 382.)
Imprisonment for from three to ten years is the penalty prescribed by the
Italian Code. (Codice Penale del Regna d'ltalia,Art. 400.)
Numerous penalties for this offence exist in Portugal. They vary from
imprisonment for a few months to more than eight years, which, in aggravated
cases, may be followed by banishment for terms up to fifteen years. (Codigo
Penal Portuguez,Arts. 432-444.)
Nearly all the penal codes of continental Europe describe burglary as a species
of robbery by violence, for which, when committed in an inhabited house, very
severe punishment is imposed. When death or wounding result, the offence
becomes capital.
American law defines robbery to be "The felonious and forcible taking of the
property of another, from his person or in his presence, against his will by
violence or by putting him in fear. The property must be the subject of
larceny, whether common law or statutory." As in theft, the animus furandiis
necessary. Force, either actual or manifested by threats, being absolutely
requisite to constitute the offence, the value of the stolen property need not
be proved. (Wharton, Criminal Law, Arts. 1081, 1083.)
The penalty under the United States statutes is imprisonment for not more than
fifteen years. (Barnes, Federal Code, Sec. 9985.)
In the various commonwealths, the culprit is usually sentenced to a long term
of penal servitude; in some of the western states, however, train robbery is a
capital crime.ED.

Anthemius, Consul for the second time, 468.

TITLE XIII. CONCERNING THE RAPE OF VIRGINS, WIDOWS, AND NUNS.
1. The Emperor Justinian to Hermogenes, Master of the Offices.
We decree that ravishers of virgins, who are of honorable rank or freeborn,
whether they have been betrothed or not, or of widows of any description,
whether they are freedwomen or the slaves of others, shall be punished with
death, as being guilty of the worst of crimes; especially when they are widows
or virgins consecrated to God, for not only in this case is an injury committed
against humanity, but against the reverence due to Almighty God himself; since
the virginity or chastity which has been destroyed cannot be restored. It is
with reason that person of this kind are condemned to death as ravishers, as
they are frequently also guilty of homicide.
Therefore, in order that a crime of such atrocity may not go unpunished, We
decree by this general constitution that those who perpetrate it, as well as
those who aid them at the time, where they are caught in the act and surprised
when committing it, can immediately be killed by the fathers or the blood-
relatives, guardians, curators, patrons or masters of the said virgins, widows,
or women of any description whatsoever, whether they are freeborn or not.
We order that these provisions shall, above all, be applicable to those who
have dared to ravish married women, for the reason that they are liable to
punishment for a double crime, that is to say, for adultery as well as rape;
and it is necessary for the crime of adultery to be punished with greater
severity on account of the other offence being added to it. We class with these
criminals one who has ventured to ravish the girl who was betrothed to him.
If, however, after the commission of such a detestable crime, the ravisher
should be able to defend himself on account of his powerful influence, or to
escape by flight, the illustrious Praetorian Prefects, as well as the
distinguished Prefect of the City in this Imperial Capital, as well as the
eminent Praetorian Prefects in Illyria and Africa, the Generals of the Army,
throughout the different portions of Our Empire, the Eminent Prefect of Egypt,
the Count of the East, the Vicegerents, Proconsuls, Dukes, and Governors of
Provinces, and Judges of every rank, who may be in those places, shall display
the greatest zeal and exert every effort to apprehend the culprit, and shall
punish with exemplary severity those who have been arrested for the commission
of such a crime, and sentence them to death after evidence which is competent
and recognized by law has been given, without permitting any exception to be
pleaded. If the defendants should wish
to appeal, We, in accordance with the provisions of the ancient law of
Constantine, refuse to grant them permission to do so.
(1) When the females who have been violated are either slaves or freedwomen,
their ravishers shall only be subjected to the penalty aforesaid, and shall not
be deprived of any portion of their property. If, however, such an atrocious
crime should be perpetrated against a woman who is freeborn, all the property
movable, immovable, or capable of moving itself, which belongs to the ravishers
themselves, or to their accomplices, associates, or followers who have given
them assistance, shall be transferred to the ownership of the said ravished
freeborn woman by a decree of court, and the efforts of her parents, husband,
guardians or curators.
When the woman above mentioned is not married, she can lawfully be united in
matrimony with any man whomsoever, except her ravisher, and the property of the
latter, or as much of it as she may desire, shall be given as the dowry of the
woman aforesaid. If she should not be willing to accept a husband, but prefers
to remain single, We order that the said property shall belong to her
absolutely, and that no judge, or any other person whosoever, shall dare to
violate this provision.
No virgin, widow, or any other woman shall be permitted to accept her ravisher
as her husband, but any person whom her parents may agree to (her ravishers
excepted) can legally marry her, as, under no circumstances, and at no time,
shall she be given permission by Us to consent to marry one who, in Our Empire,
may attempt to contract marriage in a hostile manner; for, where anyone desires
to take a wife, whether she be freeborn or a freedwoman, it is necessary to
demand her of her parents, or in accordance with Our laws and ancient customs,
of others who have charge of her, so that a lawful union may be effected with
their consent.
(2) The penalties which We have previously prescribed, that is to say, those of
death and the loss of property, We decree shall not only be inflicted upon the
ravishers themselves, but also upon those who accompanied them, and were
present when the crime took place. We subject to the punishment of death all
those who were aware of and accomplices in a crime of this kind, and have been
convicted; as well as those who harbored the culprits, or gave them any
assistance, whether they be men or women, no matter of what position, rank, or
dignity they may be; and We render them liable to this penalty, whether the
offence was perpetrated with or without the consent of the said virgins or
women.
If, however, the ravishers themselves refrained from the commission of this
crime, being deterred either by fear, or by the severity of the punishment, no
reproach can be brought against the woman, whether she gave her consent or not,
because this law has been enacted to protect women from the treachery of wicked
men, who intend to employ violence. For unless a man solicited her, and
deceived her by his detestable arts, he did not induce her to submit to such
dishonor; and if her parents, upon whom, above all, devolves the duty of
revenge,
should tolerate the crime, and stifle their grief, they shall be punished with
deportation.
(3) When anyone of a servile condition is convicted of complicity in a crime of
this description, We order him or her to be put to death by fire, without
distinction of sex, as this was also very properly provided for by the Law of
Constantine.
All the provisions of the Lex Julia,which have reference to the rape of
virgins, widows, or nuns, or which are contained in the ancient books of the
law, or in the Imperial Constitutions, are hereby abolished for the future, and
this law alone shall take the place of all others, so far as what We have
decreed concerning the rape of nuns, virgins, and widows is concerned.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof December, during the
Second Consulate of Our Lord the Emperor Justinian, 528.1
1 The term "rape," at Civil Law, had a much broader signification than it has
with us; as it included not only carnal knowledge of a woman by violence, but
also forcibly carrying her away with that intention, which was sufficient to
incur full criminal liability, even though copulation had not actually
occurred. The offence was defined, and its punishment fixed by the Lex Julia,
'de vi publica et privata,,in which are enumerated many other breaches of the
law, among them sedition, riot, appearing armed in public, arson, false
imprisonment, abuse of official power, collecting illegal taxes, and
interference with the administration of justice.
The laws of Babylon did not recognize rape as a crime except when committed
upon a woman who was betrothed.
"If a man force the (betrothed) wife of another who has not known a male and is
living in her father's house, and he lie in her bosom and they take him, that
man shall be put to death and that woman shall go free." (The Code of
Hammurabi, Sec. 130.)
Under the Salic Law, when three men violated an unmarried free woman, they each
became liable to a fine of thirty solidi.Nothing was provided concerning the
commission of the act by a smaller number, except where a freedman ravished the
manumitted female slave of another, he was fined twenty solidi.
"Si qui tres homines ingenuam puellam de casa aut de screuna rapuerint,
unusquisque eorum MCC din, qui fac. sol.XXX culp. iud."
"Si quis libertus libertam alienam rapuerit, DCCC din. qui fac. sol.XX culp.
iud." (Lex SalicaXIV, XCIII.)
The primary meaning of the verb rapere,to forcibly carry away, was adopted by
the Visigoths, who considered the crime to be consummated as soon as this took
place, carnal knowledge being merely an aggravation calling for an additional
penalty. The rape of a virgin or a widow was punished by the forfeiture of half
of the offender's property to the victim, and if sexual intercourse ensued, he
was deprived of all his possessions for her benefit, received two hundred
lashes in public, and was delivered up to the woman, or her parents, to serve
as a slave for life. (Forum JudicumIII, III, I.)
When the girl was betrothed, half of his property was given to her, and half to
her intended husband; if he had little or nothing, he was sold at auction, and
the proceeds equally divided between them. (Ibid.,Ill, III, V.)
Violation of a freeborn woman by slaves was punished by scalping, and the
infliction of three hundred lashes with a scourge. (Ibid.,Ill, III, Vill.)
The rape of a married woman was called adultery with violence, and the
perpetrator was given up to the vengeance of the husband. His property was also
transferred to the latter, provided he had no legitimate issue.
"Si quis uxori alienee, adulterium intulerit violenter, si ipse adulter filios
habens legititmos talia perpetraverit, ipse solus absque rebus addicatur marito
mulieris.
TITLE XIV. CONCERNING THE CORRECTION OF SLAVES.
1. The Emperor Constantine to Bassus.
If a master should punish his slave by striking him with rods or straps, or, in
order to keep him in custody, should place him in chains,
Si autem filios legitimos non habuerit, quibus facultas sua deberi legitime
possit, cum omnibus rebus suis in potestate mariti mulieris deveniet, ut in
eius potestate vindicia consistat." (Ibid.,Ill, IV, I.)
Rape among the Hebrews was punished capitally when the girl was betrothed,
otherwise by the payment of a specified sum regarded as an indemnification for
the
injury.
"But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man force her, and
lie with her, then the man only that lay with her shall die."
"If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is 'not betrothed, and lay hold
on her, and lie with her, and they be found;"
"Then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel's father fifty
shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife; because he hath humbled her, he
may not put her away all his days." (Deuteronomy XXII, 25, 28, 29.)
In ancient Greece, a man guilty of this offence was liable to a fine dependent
upon the civil condition of the victim.
"He that deflowers a free woman by force shall be fined an hundred drachms."
"He who in the same manner violates a young maiden's chastity shall be fined a
thousand drachms." (Potter, Antiquities of Greece I, XXVI, Page 203.)
The peculiar manner in which the accusation was filed and the complaint sworn
in Wales carry us back to the oath taken by Abraham's servant in Holy Writ.
"If a man commit a rape upon a woman and then deny it, let there be given the
oaths of fifty men, who are all Welshmen and common freeholders, to clear him.
If the woman also legally urge her complaint, having taken hold of the privy
member of the man with her left hand, and having her right hand upon the sacred
relic, let her swear that he by force defiled her with this member, and brought
insult and disgrace upon her, upon her tribe, and upon her lord. Some of the
judges will not admit of any denial against such an oath, but we have made
provision for a denial, as we have previously mentioned."
"If a man commit a rape upon a woman and acknowledge it, let him pay twelve
cows as a fine to the lord, and also her commutation fee to the lord. If she
were a maid, let him pay her the maiden fee and her dowry to the utmost amount
that he ought, as well as her satisfaction and her security; and if she be a
married woman, her satisfaction for the insult must be increased one half."
(Ancient Laws of Cambria; Laws of Howel the Good, 135, 136.)
The Saxons, like the majority of barbarians, permitted pecuniary compensation
or "bot" to be made for the commission of this offence; the amount being
regulated according to the "wer," that is, the estimated value of the guilty
party, which was determined by his rank and social position.
"If a man carry off a maiden by force, let him pay L. shillings to the owner,
and1 afterwards buy (the object of) his will of the owner."
"If she be betrothed to another man in money, let him make 'bot' with XX
shillings." (Ancient Laws and Institutes of England; The Laws of King ^thel-
bert, 82, 83.)
"If anyone ravish a widow, let him make 'bot' for it with his 'wer.' If anyone
ravish a maid, let him make 'bot' for it with his 'wer.'" (The Laws of King
Canute, 53.)
The Normans prescribed castration as the penalty.
"Si quis mulierem vi oppresserit et violaverit, membrorum dampno punietur."
(Ibid.,The Laws of King William the Conqueror XVIII.)
This was based upon the Lex Talionis,and, serious enough in itself, the
punishment was subsequently increased by the infliction of blindness, which was
in-
no objection can be raised with reference to the time he was confined, and the
master need have no fear of criminal prosecution, in case the slave should die.
For, indeed, he does not use his rights without moderation in a case of this
kind, but he will become guilty of homicide if he should intentionally inflict
a fatal wound upon the slave by means of rods, stones, or weapons; or order him
to be hung; or direct him to
eurred by the violation of a respectable matron, widow, or nun. Acknowledged
concubines were also embraced in this category. "Quod guide crimen si
couincatur, sequitur poena s. amissio mebroru, vt sit mebru p membra, quid
virgo cum cor-rupitur, mebru amittit, & idea corruptor puniatur in eo in quo
deliquit, oculos igitur amittat opter aspectu decoris, quo virgine cocupiuit,
amittat & testiculos, qui calore stupri induxerut. No autem sequitur huiusmodi
posna de qualibet fce-mina, licet vi opprimatur. 'Sequitur to/men alia grauis &
grauior, secundum qd' fuerit nupta, vel vidua honeste viuens, sanctimonialis,
vel alia matrona. lie con-cubina legittima, vel alia quasstu faciens sine
delectu quide personara."(Bracton, De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Anglix,III,
147.)
Although rape was already a crime at Common Law, the Stat. Westminster, 2, 34,
13, Edw. I, provided: "If a Man ravish a Woman married, Maid, or other, where
she did not consent, neither before nor after, he shall have Judgment of Life
and Member." (Wingate, Abridgment of All the Statutes, Page 516.) Until the
reign of Richard II, the woman could release her ravisher from the penalty by
marrying him, a privilege absolutely forbidden by Roman law. The crime could
not subsequently be pardoned, and if it was, neither party was allowed to
inherit, and the victim, if married, forfeited her dower.
The early English authorities differed as to whether rape could be committed on
a child under ten years of age, hence the Stat. 18: Eliz., Cap. 7, was enacted
to remove this doubt. This opinion was based rather upon want of physical
development than upon presumed mental incapacity to acquiesce.
Modern legislation, designed for the protection of immature girls, and which
establishes the age when a female can legally consent to the performance of the
sexual act, is inherited from Roman jurisprudence. Stuprum,or fornication,
committed on a female child less than twelve years old, was punished by
sentence to the mines, or to exile, dependent upon the rank of the offender.
(Digest, XLVIII, XIX, 38, 3.) Many nations, among them Scotland, Italy, Spain,
Holland, and Japan, following the generally recognized rule concerning puberty
adopted by Rome, have fixed the age of consent at twelve; Austria and Belgium
at fourteen; France and Sweden at fifteen; and Denmark at sixteen years.
England makes the offence a felony when the victim is under thirteen, and a
misdemeanor when she is over thirteen, and under sixteen. In this country the
age of consent varies from twelve to eighteen years.
Germany punishes rape with penal servitude for not more than ten years.
(Strafgetzbuch fur das Deutsche Reich,Art. 176.)
In Austria, the penalty is imprisonment for from five years to life, dependent
upon circumstances. (Allgemeines Strafgesetz,Arts. 125, 126, 127.)
By the Penal Code of the Russian Empire, it is not more than ten years at hard
labor. (Code Penal Russe,Art. 522.)
French law prescribes from five to twenty years. (Code Penal, Art. 332.)
In Spain rape is to a certain extent synonymous with abduction for immoral
purposes, the original meaning of the term being always taken into
consideration. (Codigo Penal,Art. 460.)
Italy fixes the penalty at from six months to five years. (Codice Penale del
Regna d'ltalia,Art. 340.)
Rape is a felony in every State of the Union, but there is a great difference
in the severity of the punishment imposed, which almost always consists of a
term of imprisonment. The popular belief in the inadequacy of the latter is
disclosed by the frequent burning of negroes in the South. It is a remarkable
fact that this is the same penalty established by the Third Section of the
preceding law, under which Roman slaves, guilty of rape, were condemned to
perish by fire.ED.
be hurled from a precipice; or give him poison; or lacerate his body publicly
by the application of iron hooks to his sides; or burn his limbs with fire; or
cause his joints to waste away by depriving them of their humors and blood; or
deprive him of life by means of torture worthy of the cruelty of the most
savage barbarians.
Given at Rome, on the fifth of the Idesof May, during the Consulate of
Constantine, Consul for the fifth time, and Licinius, 312.
TITLE XV. CONCERNING THE CORRECTION OF RELATIVES.
1. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to the Senate.
We grant the power of punishing minors to their elder relatives, according to
the nature of the offence which they have committed, in order that the remedy
of such discipline may exert its influence over those whom a praiseworthy
example at home has not induced to lead an honorable life.
We, however, are not willing that the right to inflict extremely severe
castigation for the faults of minors should be conferred, but that the exercise
of paternal authority may correct the errors of youth, and repress them by
private chastisement. If, however, the enormity of the deed should exceed the
limits of domestic correction, We decree that those guilty of atrocious crime
shall be brought before the courts of justice.
Given on the day before the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of
Valentinian and Valens, 365.
TITLE XVI. ON THE LEX CORNELIA RELATING TO ASSASSINS.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to HercuLianus and Other Soldiers.
Your brother would have done better if he had surrendered himself to the
Governor of the province, for if he had proved that the man was not struck by
him with the intention of killing him, the Governor would have rendered a
decision in accordance with military discipline by remitting the penalty of
homicide; for a crime is committed when the purpose to cause damage is present.
Those acts, however, which take place rather through unforeseen accident than
from design are, for the most part, attributed to misfortune, and not to an
intent to commit injury.
Published on the second of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of
Lsetus, Consul for the second time, and Cerealis, 216.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Quintianus.
He who, when in danger of his life, kills his aggressor or anyone else, should
have no fear of prosecution on this account.
Published on the third of the Nonesof April, during the Consulate of Arian and
Pappus, 244.
3. The Same Emperor to Quintianus.
When anyone kills another who attacks him with a sword, he should not be
considered a homicide, for the reason that the defender of his own life is not
held to have committed an offence.
4. The Emperor Gallienus to Monatius.
If (as you state) you have killed a robber, there is no doubt that it will be
decided that you have lawfully killed him who had the intention of depriving
you of life.
Published on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of
Valerius and Lucillus, 266.
5. Copy of the Imperial Epistle of the Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to
Agathus.
If it is true that he who asserts he did not intentionally commit the homicide,
but that it took place accidentally, where death appears to have resulted from
a kick, no doubt can arise upon this point, and We desire that he shall be
freed from any fear and suspicion to which he may have been liable from the
facts, as admitted, in conformity with what is set forth by Our annotation.
Given at Sirmium, on the seventh of the Kalendsof December, during the
Consulate of Diocletian, Consul for the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for
the third time, 290. -
6. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Agotius.
If anyone should accuse you under the Lex Corneliarelating to assassins, you
must prove your innocence of the crime, and not defend yourself by alleging
that you were not of age.
Ordered at Rome, on the sixth of the Kalendsof November, under the Consulate of
the Csesars.
7. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Philiscus.
He who goes about armed with the intention of killing a man, just as he who
does kill one, or through whose evil design such an act is committed, shall be
punished with the penalty prescribed by the Lex Cornelia,relating to assassins.
Ordered at Nicomedia, on the seventh of the Kalendsof January, during the
Consulate of the Csesars.
8. The Emperors Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian to Probus, Praetorian Prefect.
If any person of either sex should kill an infant, he or she is hereby notified
that they will be punished with death.
Published at Rome, on the seventh of the Idesof February, during the Consulate
of Gratian, Consul for the third time, and Equitius, 374.
9. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Cynegius,
Pr&torian Prefect.
Where a woman is found to have plotted the death of her husband, or to have had
the intention of killing him in any other way, or where
a husband has entertained a similar design against the life of his wife, all
the slaves of both husband and wife who were in the house at the time, without
excepting any of them, shall be put to torture.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Idesof December, during the
Consulate of Arcadius and Bauto, 385.
TITLE XVII.
CONCERNING THOSE WHO KILL THEIR PARENTS OR CHILDREN.
1. The Emperor Constantine to Varinus, Vicegerent of Africa.
If anyone should hasten the end of either of his parents, his son, his
daughter, or any of those relatives whose murder is designated by the term
parricide, whether he committed the act secretly or openly, he shall suffer the
penalty of parricide, and shall neither be put to death by the sword, nor by
fire, nor by any other ordinary method, but shall be sewed up in a sack with a
dog, a cock, a viper, and a monkey, and, enclosed with these wild animals and
associated with serpents, he shall be either thrown into the sea, or into a
river, according to the nature of the locality; so that, while living, he may
be deprived of all use of the elements, and during the remainder of his
existence, he may be deprived of air, and, at his death, of the earth.
Given on the eleventh of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of
Licinius, Consul for the fifth time, and Crispus, 319.
TITLE XVIII.
CONCERNING POISONERS, DIVINERS, AND OTHER CRIMINALS OF THE SAME DESCRIPTION.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Titius.
It is a more serious crime to kill a man by poison, than to cause his death by
means of a weapon.1
Published without date or designation of consulate.
1 Owing to the atrocious nature of the act, and the facility with which it can
be committed, affording the victim no opportunity for defence, the intentional
administration of poison was, at Common Law, always considered to indicate
deliberate malice.
"The poysoning of any man, whereof he dieth within the year, implieth malice,
and is adjudged willful murder of malice prepensed." (Coke, Institutes III, 7,
52.)
"He that wilfully gives poison to another, that hath provoked him or not, is
guilty of wilful murder; the reason is, because it is an act of deliberation,
odious in law, and presumes malice." (Hale, Pleas of the Crown I, XXVIII, Page
455.)
Modern enactments have rendered the mere administration of poison with
homicidal design a capital felony. "Whosoever shall administer to, or cause to
be taken by any person, any poison or other destructive thing with intent to
commit murder, shall be guilty of felony, and, being convicted thereof, shall
suffer death." (Stat. 1, Vie., C. 185, Archbold, Criminal Procedure, Vol. 1,
Page 942.)
American jurists do not recognize any difference between malice express and
implied. "Our only way of proving malice is by inferring it from
circumstances."
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Cxsars, to Tiberius.
It is a matter of public interest to learn and practice the science of
geometry, but the art of divination is damnable, and is strictly prohibited.
Ordered at Sirmium, on the thirteenth of the Kalends ofSeptember, during the
Consulate of the Caesars.
3. The Emperor Constantine to Maximus.
No haruspex, no priest, and none of those who are accustomed to practice this
art, shall approach the threshhold of another, either for this or for any other
purpose; but the friendship of men of this kind (even though it may be of long
standing) shall be rejected, and any haruspex who approaches another's house
shall be put to death by fire; and anyone who has, either by solicitation or
with the hope of reward, induced him to come, shall be deported to an island,
after his property has been confiscated.
We consider that an accuser of a crime of this kind should not be classed as an
informer, but should rather be worthy of reward.
Published at Rome, on the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of
Constantine, Consul for the fifth time, and Licinius, 312.
4. The Same Emperor and Csssar to Bassus, Praetorian Prefect.
The knowledge of those who, by means of magic arts, plot against the health or
lives of men, or turn chaste minds to licentiousness, should be punished, and
repressed by the severest laws. Those, however, who seek remedies for the
ailments of humanity, or, while in the country, innocently exert themselves to
preserve grapes from showers, or from the effects of rain or hail, ought not to
be liable to criminal accusations, as their efforts are directed not to the
injury of the health or reputation of mankind, but to prevent the gifts of God
and the labors of humanity from being destroyed.
Given at Aquileia, on the tenth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of
Crispus and Constantius, 321.
5. The Emperor Constantius and the Ctesar Julian to the People.
No one shall consult an haruspex, a diviner, or a soothsayer, and wicked
confessions made to augurs and prophets must cease. Chaldeans, magicians, and
others who are commonly called malefactors on account of the enormity of their
crimes, shall no longer practice their infamous arts. Let all curiosity
relating to divination be at an
(Wharton, Criminal Law, Sec. 145.) Nor is the doctrine that death caused by the
deliberate administration of poison is wilful murder invariably accepted where
no statutory provision to the contrary exists.
"A homicide by poison is not necessarily murder at Common Law. If it is not, it
is not murder in the first degree. At the same time, when the evidence shows
that the death was effected by intentional and malicious poisoning, the court,
when not precluded by statute, may tell the jury that the offense is murder in
the first degree." (Ibid.,Sec. 511.)ED.
end, for anyone who hereafter refuses obedience to Our orders shall be put to
death, and laid low with the avenging sword.
Given at Milan, on the eighth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate
of Constantius, Consul for the eighth time, and the Caesar Julian, 357.
6. The Same Emperor to the People.
Many persons do not hesitate to disturb the elements by the use of magic, plot
against the lives of innocent people, and, by the invocation of household gods,
dare to provide means by which anyone can destroy his enemies by evil arts.
Such person shall be thrown to wild beasts, as they are of a nature different
from that of ordinary mortals.
Given at Milan, on the day before the Nonesof December, during the Consulate of
Constantius, Consul for the ninth time, and Julian, Consul for the second time,
357.
7. The Same Emperor to Taurus, Prsetorian Prefect.
As the bodies of those who are in the enjoyment of high rank are exempt from
torture, except for certain crimes specified by the laws, and as magicians in
every portion of the world should be considered the enemies of the human race,
and also as those who belong to Our retinue directly offend Our Majesty when
they practice these arts, therefore, if a magician, or anyone accustomed to the
use of magic verses, and who is usually styled by the people a sorcerer, an
haruspex, a soothsayer, an augur, or a diviner, or anyone who employs himself
in the interpretation of dreams, or practices anything similar to the arts
above mentioned, should be found in My retinue, or in that of the Caesar, he
shall be deprived of his rank and punished, and shall not be exempt from
torture. And if, after having been convicted, he should continue to deny the
offence before those who have detected it, he shall be placed upon the rack,
and his sides torn by iron hooks, as these penalties are suitable for a crime
of such enormity.
Given on the third of the Nonesof July, during the Consulate of Titian and
Cerealis, 358.
8. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Modestus, Prsetorian Prefect.
The guilt of a person who studies things that are prohibited is equal to that
of him who teaches them.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Idesof December, during the
Consulate of Valentinian and Valens, 365.
9. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Albinus, Prsetorian
Prefect.
Anyone who learns of, and surprises and seizes another polluted by the practice
of magic arts, must immediately expose him, and bring the enemy of the public
welfare into court.
If a driver, that is, a charioteer, or any other person, should attempt to
violate this law, or should oppress the victim of their perni-
cious arts with secret punishments, he shall not escape the death penalty, as
he is subject to suspicion for two reasons; first, because he either prevented
him from being publicly dealt with, lest he might reveal his accomplices in the
crime, and escape the severity of the laws and the torture to which he was
liable; or, because he may have formed an atrocious design to kill his own
enemy under the pretext of vengeance.
Given on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of
Timasius and Promotus, 389.
TITLE XIX. CONCERNING THE VIOLATION OF SEPULCHRES.
1. The Emperor Gordian to Zeno.
Those who knowingly do not hesitate to purchase and sell property destined for
religious uses, especially when it has already been employed for that purpose,
are warned that although the sale is not valid in law, still, they are guilty
of the crime of injury to religion.
Published on the third of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Sabinus,
Consul for the second time, and Venustus, 241.
2. The Emperor Constantine to Tatian, Prefect of the City.
When a slave who is caught demolishing a tomb did so without the knowledge of
his master, he shall be sentenced to the mines. If, on the other hand, he was
induced to do so by the authority or order of his master, he shall be punished
with relegation. When anything taken from the tomb is found to have been
carried either to the city or country home of his master, the house or
building, no matter what it may be, shall be confiscated to the Treasury.
Given on the seventh of the Idesof July, during the Consulate of Acindynus and
Proculus, 340.
3. The Same Emperor to Limenius, Praetorian Prefect.
Where anyone either violates a tomb, or attempts to do so, and the judges of
the district neglect to punish the crime, they shall be fined not less than
twenty pounds of gold, which has been fixed as the penalty for violators of
tombs, and they shall be compelled to pay it into the Treasury of Our
Largesses.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Limenius and
Catulinus, 349.
4. The Same Emperor to the People.
Those who violate tombs, or, I should say, the houses of the dead, are
considered to have perpetrated a double crime; for, by destroying them they
robbed those who are buried, and by erecting new structures with the materials,
they contaminate the living. Therefore, if anyone should remove from a tomb
either stones, marble, columns, or any other materials to be used for building
purposes, or should do so with the intention of selling them, he shall be
compelled to pay ten
pounds of gold to the Treasury; or if anyone, defending his own tomb, should
file such a complaint in court, or some other person should bring the
accusation, or notify any official of the act, this penalty ought to be added
to the one formerly prescribed; for none of the punishments imposed upon those
who violate tombs are considered to have been repealed.
These penalties shall be inflicted upon him who handles the bodies of persons
who have been buried, or the remains of the same.
Given at Milan, on the Idesof June, during the Consulate of Constantine, Consul
for the ninth time, and the Caesar Julian, 357.
5. The Emperor Julian to the People.
The audacity of the violators of tombs extends even to injuring the busts of
the deceased and the consecrated mounds upon which they are raised; and our
ancestors always considered it a crime resembling sacrilege to take away stones
from them to disturb the soil, and to tear up the turf of the same. It is also
deemed an offence to remove the ornaments of tombs for the purpose of
decorating banqueting halls or porticoes.
We, therefore, having this in view, in the first place, forbid such acts to be
committed under the penalty of sacrilege, lest the respect to which deceased
persons are entitled may be violated.1
Given at Antioch, on the day before the Idesof February, during the Consulate
of Julian, Consul for the fourth time, and Sallust, 363.
6. The Emperor Justin to Theodore.
As it is unjust, and unworthy of Our reign for injury to be done to the remains
of deceased persons by those who allege that the latter were indebted to them,
and who, for the purpose of exacting the debt, interfere with their burial, We,
in order to prevent this injury from being committed hereafter, and those whose
duty it is to conduct the funeral of the deceased from losing their rights, do
hereby decree that any instruments which may have been executed by the heirs
before the corpse was buried, for the purpose of collecting what was alleged to
be due, or any admissions which have been made by them, or any security which
has been furnished, or any pledges which have been taken, shall be absolutely
void. All pledges which have been given, or money which has been paid, shall be
returned, and any sureties who have been furnished shall be released from
liability; and, generally speaking, everything shall be restored to its former
condition unaltered, and the principal matter, as it was in the beginning,
shall be disposed of in court.
Moreover, anyone who has been found guilty of a crime of this kind shall pay
fifty pounds of gold, or, if he has not the means to do so, he shall suffer
such corporeal punishment as may be inflicted by a competent judge.2
1 Proceedings for the violation of a tomb involved the penalty of infamy.
"Sepulcri violati actio infamiam irrogat."ED.
2 It was the belief of the Romans, who practiced cremation, that a grave became
religious the moment the earth was cast upon the bones of the dead; and

of Olybrius, 526.
Extract from Novel 60, Chapter I. Latin Text.
Likewise, anyone who enters the house of a dying person, and annoys either him
or others who are members of his family, or attaches seals to his property
without having employed the services of an
that then the rights conferred by the laws immediately attached to the place of
sepulture. "Nam prius quam in os inieota gleba est, locus ille, ubi crematum
est corpus, nihil habet religionis; iniecta gleba turn et illis humatus est, et
gleba vocatur, ao turn denique multa religiosa iura conplectitur."(Cicero, De
Legibus,II, 22, 57.) Even the tomb of a slave was also invested with this
sacred character, which was largely due to the fact that the spirits of
departed ancestors were deified, and appropriate sacrifices and other
ceremonies were, on certain occasions, regularly performed in their honor at
their sepulchres.
Violation of a grave was, in ancient times, punished with much greater severity
than it is at present.
In Greece, while the penalty was left to the discretion of the magistrate, it
was provided that it should be exemplary.
"He that defaceth a sepulchre, or lays one of a different family in that of
another, breaks it, eraseth the inscription, or beats down the pillar, shall
suffer condign punishment." (Potter, Antiquities of Greece I, XXVI, Page 207.)
Under the domination of the Visigoths, anyone who damaged a tomb, or robbed a
dead body, was compelled to give a pound of gold to the heirs of the deceased,
and if there were none, it was paid to the Royal Treasury, and the offender
received a hundred lashes. A slave was given two hundred, and then burned to
death. In every instance, the return of the stolen property was required. "Si
quis sepulcri violator extiterit; aut mortuum expoliaverit, et ei aut ornamenta
vel vesti-menta abstwlerit; si liber hoe feeerit, libram auri coactus exsolvat
hseredibus mortui, et quie abstulit reddat. Quod si hseredes non fuerint, fisco
nostro cogatur inferre, et prieterea C. flagella suscipiat. Servus vero si hoc
crimen admiserit,CC. flagella suscipiat, insuper et flammis ardentibus
exuratur, redditis nihilominus cunctis qua visus est abstulisse." (Forum
JudicumXI, II.)
The laws of Alfonso X imposed a fine of ten pounds of gold, and confiscated the
land on which the building materials taken from the tomb were used. If the fine
was not paid, the alternative was perpetual exile. Death was inflicted where
armed men robbed a corpse; when they were unarmed, the penalty was confinement
at hard labor for life.
"Aquel que sacare las piedras e los ladrillos de los monumentos, deuen perder
la lauor que fiziere con ellos, e el lugar en que los obrare deue ser del Rey,
e demas deue pechar a la Camara del Rey diez librus de oro; e si non ouiere de
que las pechar, deue ser desterrado para siempre. E los ladrones que
desotierran, o des-pojan los muertos, para furtar los panos en que estan
embueltos, si lo fizieren con armas, deuen morir porende; mas si lo fizieren
sin armas, deuen ser condenados para siempre a las lauores del Rey." (Las Siete
PartidasVII, IX, XII.)
Disinterment of a corpse for gain or dissection was a misdemeanor at Common
Law, and became a felony only where the shroud or any of the clothing was
taken, the ownership of which was vested in the legal representatives of the
deceased. "The property of the sheets was in the executors, administrators or
other owner of them, for the dead body isnot capable of any property." (Coke,
Institutes III, XVLII, 110.)
A corpse itself is not susceptible of larceny. "The dead body of a human being
is not capable of being stolen." (Stephen, A Digest of Criminal Law VI, XXXIV,
Art. 292.) It is as yet undetermined whether this applies to skeletons and
anatomical preparations of dead bodies, or only to the corpse in its entirety.
(Ibid.)This would probably depend upon their identification, an almost
impossible undertaking, unless their mere possession would afford the
presumption of

death of the person aforesaid, and whatever he has taken can be recovered from
him by the heirs of the injured party, the third part of his property shall be

He, also, is liable to the same penalties who interferes with the funeral
ceremonies of a deceased person, or forbids them to be celebrated.
Extract from Novel 115, Chapter V. Latin Text.
No one shall hereafter be annoyed on account of any claim owed by a deceased
person until nine days have elapsed from the time of his death; and if any bond
or similar security should be executed, it will be void. The rights of
creditors shall not, however, be prejudiced by this provision.
TITLE XX. ON THE LEX FABIA CONCERNING KIDNAPPING.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Placidus.
Let your father proceed civilly by an action in rembefore a competent
magistrate against him by whom he alleges his female slave has been seduced,
and that kidnapping has been perpetrated by carrying her away. If he should
gain his case, he can also prosecute him criminally under the Fabian Law. If
the slave was kidnapped, he will not be forbidden to bring an accusation
against him for this offence.1
stolen property. The interests of medical science are obviously opposed to the
unqualified adoption of this principle.
The English rule, above stated, is generally applicable in the United States.
(VideWharton Criminal Law, Arts. 1098, 1176.) The horrible and unfeeling
practice of grave-robbing for the purpose of extorting money from the relatives
of the deceased, so prevalent in this country in recent times, has caused the
enactment of many criminal statutes imposing long terms of imprisonment at hard
labor for
this offence.
Violation of sepulchres is punished in Spain by imprisonment for from one month
and one day to six months, and a fine of from 125 to 1250 pesetas (Codigo Penal
de Espana,Art. 350); in France, by imprisonment of from three months to a year,
and a fine of 16 to 200 francs (Code Penal de France,Art. 360) ; in Belgium, by
imprisonment of from one month to one year, and a fine of from 26 to 200 francs
(Code des Lois Penales Beiges,Art. 453); in Italy, by imprisonment for from
three months to three years, and a fine of from 50 to 1500 lire (Codice Penale
del Regna d'ltalia,Art. 144); in Portugal, by imprisonment not to exceed one
year, and a corresponding fine (Codigo Penal Portuguez,Art. 247); in Germany,
by imprisonment at hard labor for not more than two years (Strafgesetzbuch fur
das Deutsche Reich,Art. 167); in Austria, by from one to six months'
imprisonment, and the penalty for theft, in addition, where anything is stolen
(All-gemeines Strafgesetz,Art. 306); in Sweden, by imprisonment for not longer
than six months, and a fine of at least 25 riksdalers (Sveriges Rikes LagXI,
Cap. Sec. 4) ; in Japan, by penal servitude for from two to five years
(Criminal Code of Japan, Arts. 220, 221, 222.)ED.

man-

2. The Same Emperor to Aurelius.
If you can prove that your slave was harbored by Julianus, and concealed by him
for some time, and that he afterwards persuaded him to take to flight, you can
either yourself, or by your attorney, prosecute him for the crime, or you can
bring the proper action against him, that is to say, one for having corrupted
the slave.

Antoninus, Consul for the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
3. The Emperor Alexander to Cornelius.
In order for the penalty of the Fabian Law to be incurred, the charge must be
signed, the accusation made, and the sentence passed.
Published on the eighth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Julian,
Consul for the second time, and Crispinus, 225.
4. The Emperor Gordian to Paulina.
The sentence pronounced by the Attorney for the Crown, if he did not at the
time occupy the place of the Governor, who has power to act under the Fabian
Law, is void; as the administration of this law comes solely within the
jurisdiction of the Governor of the province.
Published on the third of the Nonesof December, during the Consulate of Gordian
and Aviola, 240.
5. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus and the Caesars to Juliana.
If your adversary took your brother away, you should file a criminal accusation
against him under the Fabian Law, before the Governor of the province.
Published on the Nonesof May, during the Consulate of ^Emilianus and Bassus,
260.
6. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Martiana.
It is not lawful either to sell or give away a fugitive slave. Hence you will
understand that you are liable under the law which imposes a certain penalty to
be paid to the Treasury on account of crimes of this description, except in the
case of co-heirs and partners who, in the division of the common property, are
permitted to bid against one another for a fugitive slave. Therefore, in this
instance, it is lawful to sell a fugitive slave, and the sale will be valid
when he is found and seized by the purchaser.

Caesars.
umitted slave, or one actually in servitude, but to whom the vendor had no
title. The detestation to which this crime was regarded by the Romans as
affecting the liberty of the citizen is disclosed by the penalties prescribed.
The magistrate was invested with discretionary power, and could sentence
persons of rank to relegation and the confiscation of half their property, and
crucify, or send offenders of inferior position to the mines. A slave who had
been convicted of kidnapping was required to remain in bondage for ten years
after his master's death. By the laws of the early Emperors, this crime always
incurred the penalty of death.ED.
7. The Same Emperor to Maximus, Prefect of the City.
As you state that certain slaves have been removed from the city by kidnapping,
and that freeborn men are sometimes carried away in the commission of the same
crime, We decree that you shall have permission to punish such an offence with
extreme severity, and, therefore, if you find anyone guilty of it, do not
hesitate to sentence him to death, in order that others may be deterred by the
penalty, and not venture, by an audacious act of this kind, to kidnap either
slaves or freemen from the city, and sell them.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof December, during the Consulate of Diocletian,
Consul for the third time, and Maximian, 287.
8. The Same Emperors and Csssars to Confidius.
The Governor of the province, after having first decided the right of
ownership, will determine whether the accusation of kidnapping should be heard
or not; for if the slave should be found to be your property, the proof of
ownership having been established, the intention of the crime will be lacking.
If, however, after the question of ownership has been decided, it should be
proved that the slave belongs to another, the Governor will hear the criminal
accusation.
Published on the eighth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of
Diocletian, Consul for the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third
time.
9. The Same Emperors and Csssars to Eugenius.
It is a positive rule of law that he who conceals another's slave is liable
under the Fabian Law.
Ordered at Heraclia, on the third of the Idesof May, during the Consulate of
the above-mentioned Emperors, 290.
10. The Same Emperors and Csssars to Diza.
It is settled that he who purchases from another a slave that has been
kidnapped, and he is not proved to have been an accomplice in the perpetration
of the offence, is not criminally liable.
Ordered during the Nonesof November, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors.
11. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Marpiata.
The sale of a kidnapped slave does not change the status, nor, where the crime
is committed by the kidnapping of a free person, is the status of the latter
affected.
Ordered during the Idesof November, during the Consulate of the above-mentioned
Emperors.
12. The Same Emperors and Csssars to Mutianus.
Anyone who knowingly harbors a fugitive slave and receives stolen property is
liable on this ground to an action of theft; and the Governor of the province
must cause the property to be restored to you, together with the ordinary
penalty. If, however, you should bring an
accusation for the crime of kidnapping, he will not hesitate to afford you a
hearing.
Ordered on the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of the Caesars.
13. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Severinus.
The accusation of the crime of kidnapping shall be included among those of
public offences.
Ordered on the fifth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of the
Caesars.
14. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Callisthenes.
An accusation for the crime of kidnapping cannot be legally brought when those
who are alleged to be guilty assert that they thought that the slaves or free
persons in question belonged to them, and that they had good grounds for this
belief, and did not adopt it as a pretext for committing the act.
Ordered at Nicomedia, on the day before the Nonesof December, during the
Consulate of the Caesars.
15. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Pomponius.
Anyone, by selling a freeman without his consent, becomes liable to the penalty
for kidnapping if he is aware of his condition.
Given at Nicomedia, on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the
Consulate of the Caesars.
16. The Emperor Constantine to Domitius Celsus, Vicegerent of Africa.
Those who inflict wretchedness upon parents by kidnapping their living children
are liable to be sentenced to the mines, in addition to the other penalties
already prescribed by the laws. Where, however, anyone is accused and convicted
of a crime of this kind, if he is a slave or a freedman, he shall be thrown to
wild beasts; if he is freeborn, he shall perish by the sword.

the fourth time, and Licinius, 315.
TITLE XXI.
OONNTHE VlSCELLIAN LAW.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian and the Csesars to Bacchus.
The Viscellian Law prohibits persons of the condition of freedmen from daring
to assume such honors and dignities as belong to those who are freeborn, or to
usurp the office of decurion, unless they have been authorized to do so by
having obtained the right from the Emperor to wear gold rings, for then they
are entitled to the appearance, but not to the actual status of free birth
during their lives; and,
without any risk to themselves, can perform the public duties of those offices
to which freeborn persons are eligible.
Moreover, any freedman, who declares that he is freeborn, will not only be
civilly liable for his acts, but can also be prosecuted criminally under the
Viscellian Law. He, also, who usurps the decurionate, shall be branded with
infamy.
There is no doubt that individual freedmen, while in the country of their
patrons are, in proportion to their means, required to discharge the personal
duties to which men of this kind are usually liable.
Published at Antioch, on the second of the Idesof February, during the
Consulate of the Caesars.
TITLE XXII. ON THE CORNELIAN LAW WITH REFERENCE TO FORGERY.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Severinus.
If you accuse the other party of the crime of the substitution of a child, the
trial of the case, which is a capital one, should not be deferred until the boy
reaches the age of puberty, which has already been decided by Myself and My
Divine Father, Severus; for it is probable that the woman who is accused will
defend herself in every way possible, to avoid suffering the penalty of death.
Published on the Nonesof March, during the Consulate of the two Aspers, 213.
2. The Emperor Alexander to Valerius.
It has been clearly stated in the Rescripts of My ancestors that, when the
crime of forgery has been committed by a debtor for the purpose of postponing
payment, he should, nevertheless, be compelled to discharge the debt,
irrespective of the criminal prosecution.
Published on the third of the Nonesof May, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and ^lianus, 224.
3. The Same Emperor to Cassius.«
Although you have accepted the legacy left you under the will which you allege
is forged, and which you accuse your father's wife, that is to say, your step-
mother, of having substituted for the genuine will, which she abstracted at a
time when you did not know that a crime had been committed, you will,
nevertheless, not be prevented from bringing a criminal accusation against her,
after the legal formalities have been complied with.
Published on the eleventh of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Albinus and Maximus, 228.
4. The Same Emperor to Maximus.
Those who make use of forged rescripts should be punished by a penalty worthy
of the offence, and of exemplary severity. Anyone, however, who has been
deceived by another, and who can prove his
innocence, and produce the person from whom he received the forged document,
shall be released.
Published on the fourth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Albinus and Maximus, 228.
5. The Same Emperor to Petronius.
My principles forbid an accusation of forgery, or of any other capital crime,
to be brought against your mother, but this matter does not deprive her of any
pecuniary rights; since if any doubt exists with reference to the will in
question under which your mother claims a trust, an inquiry can be instituted
as to its genuineness, without fear of a criminal proceeding.

Anyone who has asserted that a will is false, and has lost his case, will have
no right to a bequest left by the deceased under the terms of said will.
Published on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of
Philip and Titian, 246.
7. The Emperors Valerian and Gattienus and the Csesar Valerian to Heliodorus.
You yourself state that when your adversaries first produced the instruments in
question, you suspected their genuineness; therefore, having made a compromise,
it will be difficult for the Governor of the province to permit you to denounce
as forged the documents which you have once accepted.
Published on the third of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Fuscus
and Bassus, 240.
8. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Marinus.
If you state that certain codicils were forged by the persons against whom you
filed your petition, they cannot escape the accusation denying that they
availed themselves of the same; for those alone can be benefited by abstaining
from the use of an instrument of this kind who are not themselves alleged to
have been the forgers of it, and whom the employment alone of the said
instrument would render liable.
Those, however, who after criminally forging the codicils, have incurred the
severity of the Cornelian Law, cannot avoid punishment for the crime, by
setting up the defence that they have refused to make use of them.

.^Emilianus and Bassus, 260.
9. The Emperors Carinus and Numerianus to Mesius.If you should prove before the
Governor of the province that you are the heir at law of the person who wrote
the codicil, the ordinary
rule is that, after you have been placed in possession of the estate, you must
execute the trusts which have been lawfully bequeathed, unless it is your
intention to prove that the codicil is forged. But if you have instituted
criminal proceedings, and they have been dismissed through Our indulgence, you
will still be entitled to an investigation, and can bring a civil action in
order to determine the genuineness of the codicil. Published on the third of
the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Carinus, Consul for the second

conformity with the opinion of that most learned jurist, Paulus, also decide
civilly with reference to the genuineness of written instruments.

Prosecution for the crime of forgery, like almost all others, is not barred by
prescription, unless twenty years have elapsed.1
Ordered on the sixth of the Idesof January, during the Consulate of the
Cassars.
1 It was the ancient rule in England, in accordance with the maxim, "Nullum,
tempus occurrit Regi,"that the lapse of no time, however long, would be a bar
to either civil or criminal proceedings instituted in the name of the Crown.
This was afterwards changed by custom as well as statute. "At Common Law
appeals (i. e.formal accusations) were to be brought within a year and day
after the offence committed." (Danvers, A General Abridgment of the Common Law,
Vol. I, Page 491; Britton, De Legibus Anglicanis,Cap. XXIV, Pages 45, 46;
Staunforde, Les Plees del CoronII, Cap. 13.) The limitation is said by
Blackstone to have been derived from the Goths. "Prsescriptio annalis qux
currit adversus actorem, si de homicida ei noh constat intra ammum a ciede
facta nee quenquam interea arguet et accusat."(Commentaries on the Laws of
England IV, XXIII, Page 315.) By Stat. 13, Car. II, Chap. \,the time was
shortened in cases of treason. "No Person by virtue of this Act shall incur any
Penalty unless he be prosecuted within Six Months after the Offence committed,
and indicted within Three Months after such Prosecution." (Wingate, Abridgment
of all the Statutes from the Beginning of Magna Charta, Page 631.) By the
Treason Act, 1695, it was extended to three years, except only when the
assassination of the King by poison or otherwise had been planned.
(VideStephen, Commentaries on the Laws of England VI, VI, Page 144.)

of the above-mentioned Emperors.
15. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Rufus.
If a creditor, acting in collusion with his debtor, sold you the tract of land,
he has committed the crime of deceit, and has done you no injury, but, on the
other hand, has rendered himself liable to prosecution for the offence.
Ordered on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of
the Csesars.
16. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Fortunatus.
There are two ways open to a person desiring to contest the genuineness of a
will. Therefore, although you cannot institute criminal proceedings by an
attorney, still you will not be prevented from bringing a civil action
impeaching the genuineness of the will, as the accused cannot only legally be
sued by another, but can also be criminally prosecuted by him who brings the
civil action.

the revenue laws have been violated, the term is five years. (Barnes, Federal
Code, Arts. 1445, 1448.) Many of the States have statutes of limitations
applicable to misdemeanors.
In France, a malefactor is not liable to prosecution for a serious crime after
ten years from its perpetration, provided no legal investigation of the same
has been begun in the interval. Criminal proceedings for minor offences cannot
be instituted after three years. (Code Penal de France,Arts. 637, 638.)
Spain prescribes criminal action for felonies after twenty, fifteen, and ten
years; for other breaches of the law the time is from two months to one year.
(Codigo Penal de Espana,Art. 133.)
In Italy, the term varies for from six months to twenty years, dependent upon
the nature of the offence (Codice Periale del Regna d'ltalia,Art. 91) ; in
Germany, it runs from three months to twenty years (Strafgesetz fur das
Deutsche Reich,Sec. 67) ; and in Portugal, from one to fifteen years (Codigo
Penal Portuguez,Art. 125).ED.

Legal possession does not render a title valid which was fraudulent in the
beginning, therefore you can institute a criminal prosecution against those
whom you allege are contesting the ownership of the land with you.
Ordered on the third of the Nonesof March, during the Consulate
of the Csesars.
19. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Cosmia.
Even if you are interested in the matter, still you should deliberate carefully
in your own mind as to your course, in order that you may not bring an unlawful
accusation by alleging that the instrument which you have signed is forged. But
as it is not permissible to accuse women of forgery in matters in which they
are not directly interested, and you acknowledge that you formerly gave this
same land to another, you ask that the power of bringing the accusation be
granted you contrary to the rule of law.
Ordered on the eighth of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of the Csesars.
20. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Rufinus.
The fact that the copy of the rescript was incorrectly made should not delay
its investigation by the judge to whom the case was assigned, as the parties
will not be liable to a criminal prosecution unless they have intentionally
committed forgery.
Signed on the eleventh of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of the
Csesars.
21. The Emperor Constantine to Mechilius Hilariamis.
If a decurion should write a will, a codicil, or any other instrument for.the
disposition of the property of a person who is dying, or should officially draw
up any public or private documents, and then be prosecuted for forgery, he
shall be deprived of his office, and subjected to torture if the case requires
it.
He, however, who is accused of an act of this kind, does not immediately cease
to be a decurion, for he will remain such so far as his municipal functions are
concerned; but he cannot avail himself of the privileges of the decurionate
with reference to the matter in controversy, the truth of which is to be
ascertained. Nor can he who was formerly a notary, and afterwards became a
decurion, plead the
privileges of this office for the purpose of escaping torture on account of
documents which he formerly drew up, as their genuineness must be proved by the
author himself if circumstances demand it.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of Sabinus
and Rufinus, 316.
22. The Same Emperor to Maximus, Prefect of the City.
When the investigation of a case of forgery takes place, every attempt must be
made to obtain proofs, witnesses, comparison of documents, and all other
methods of ascertaining the truth, nor shall the accuser be the only person
interrogated, or be required to furnish all the evidence, but the judge must
occupy an intermediate position between the two parties, and not divulge what
he thinks by means of any interlocutory decree, unless he gives some
indication, which is solely required by his duty as a magistrate, for the
purpose of furthering the proceedings; and he must finally state his opinion in
the decision which he renders.
We limit the prosecution of a criminal case of this kind to the term of two
years, which it shall not be lawful for either party to exceed. And the
beginning of the same shall arise at the time when the accusation is contested
before a competent judge; and, after the crime has been proved, the person who
committed the forgery shall be put to death, if the enormity of the offence
demands it; or he shall be sentenced to deportation.

23. The Emperors Valens, Gratian, and Valentinian to Maxima, Prsetorian
Prefect.
We grant permission to litigants, after a disputed instrument has been
presented to the court, for him who questions its genuineness, to be compelled
to publicly state whether he intends to proceed criminally or civilly with
reference to the alleged forgery. If he intends to proceed criminally, he must
bring an accusation for forgery, and as soon as the civil suit has been
terminated by a decision, the criminal prosecution can take place, so that if
anyone should attempt to introduce wills, receipts, attestations, public or
private accounts, agreements, letters, final dispositions, written proofs of
donations, bills of sale, or any other documents, the contestant shall have the
power to bring the accusation.
With reference to the civil investigation, however, a less rigid examination of
the parties litigant should be made, as the judge who presides over the
criminal trial can punish the false statements of the plaintiff and the
criminal acts of the defendants with legal penalties.

Whether a civil or a criminal proceeding (as may be selected by the plaintiff)
has been instituted with reference to codicils, or other written instruments
which have been produced in court, We grant permission for the proof of the
genuineness of said instruments first to be required of him who offered them in
evidence, and then he who , is ready to prove that they are forged shall be
allowed to establish his
allegations.1

1 The practice of forging, altering, destroying, and substituting wills having
become so prevalent under the Republic as to become an intolerable abuse, the
Lex Corneliawas enacted, at the instance of Sylla, with a view to preventing it
by means of the severe penalty of interdiction of fire and water. This law did
not, however, apply to other crimes of a similar character, and its scope was
greatly enlarged by subsequent legislation, so as to include false swearing,
subornation of perjury, forgery, the execution or attestation of any written
instrument, conspiracy to cause the death of innocent persons, counterfeiting,
and the sale or suppression of testimony. This was the crimen falsiof Roman
jurisprudence, which, while embracing nearly every species of deceit by whose
agency anyone might be prejudiced, or deprived of his rights, was generally
synonymous with the fabrication, or fraudulent alteration of documents to
which, when not otherwise distinctly specified, it was presumed to refer. The
punishment was afterwards changed to deportation, hard labor in the mines,
crucifixion, and death.
The crimen falsi,with, however, a more restricted meaning and application, was
known to the Common Law of England, and originally had particular reference to
the forgery of the seal of the king and of those of members of the royal
family. It also included the attaching of false seals to private instruments.
The penalty was either banishment or death by hanging. "Crimen vero falsi
dicitur, cum quis accusatus fuerit quod sigillum regis, vel appellatus quod
sigillum Domini sui de cujus familia fuerit, falsaverit, & brevia inde
consignaverit, vel chartum aliquam vel literam ad exhxredationem Domini vel
alterius damnum sic sigillaverit; & quibus casibus si quis inde convictus
fuerit, detractari meruit & suspendi. Et quod de hujusmodi falsar1 dicitur, de
sigilla adulterina chartis & literis apponenti-bus dicatur id idem."(Fleta,
Commentarius Juris Anglicani I,22.)
In after times, the signification of the term became fully as extended as under
the Civil Law, to which it owed its origin.
The Visigoths placed perjury and forgery in the same category, and punished
both alike. (Forum JudicumII, IV, VII; VII, V, II.)
By the Babylonian law, a perjurer received the same penalty as the person
against whom he swore falsely would have received, had his crime been
successful.
"If a man, in a case (pending judgment), bear false (threatening) witness, or
do not establish the testimony that he has given, if that case be a case
involving life, that man shall be put to death."
"If a man (in a case) bear witness for grain or money (as a bribe), he shall
himself bear the penalty imposed in that case." (The Code of Hammurabi 3, 4.)
This rule was also adopted by the Hebrews. "And the judge shall make diligent
inquisition; and, behold, if the witness be a false witness, and hath testified
falsely against his brother:
"Then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to have done unto his brother."
(Deuteronomy XIX, 18, 19.)
Mohammedan authorities vary as to the punishment to be inflicted upon one who
gives false testimony. Some confine themselves to publicly denouncing the
culprit as infa^nous; others declare he should be scourged. (The Hedaya II,
XXI.)
In ancient Athens, the perjurer could be compelled to answer in a private
proceeding at the instance of the injured party. "Let the penalty of the action
TITLE XXIII.
CONCERNING THOSE WHO DRAW UP WILLS UNDER WHICH THEY ARE BENEFICIARIES.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Valatius.
Although jurists hold that it is contrary to the Cornelian Law for an
emancipated son, at the dictation of his father to write in a will, that he is
his heir, still, if before the will was drawn up he would have been his lawful
successor, and had acquired possession of the property, he would be considered
his heir; just as if your father had appointed you his heir with his own hand,
and you had only discharged your duty as his son.
Published on the Nonesof September, during the Consulate of the two Aspers,
213.
2. The Same Emperor to Atticius.
If the testator, who wrote the codicil with his own hand, stated therein that
either a legacy or a trust was left to you, you will not be considered to have
incurred the penalty imposed by the Decree of the Senate. But if he mentioned
in the codicil that he had dictated the will, you should not claim the legacy
or the trust, and you will be released from liability for the penalty on
account of Our Imperial indulgence.
Published on the Idesof December, during the Consulate of Antoninus, Consul for
the fourth time, and Balbinus, 214.
3. The Emperor Alexander to Martial.
It was forbidden by the Decree of the Senate and the Edict of the Divine
Claudius that those who write the wills of otherseven though at the dictation
of the testatorsshould include in them any bequest to themselves, and the
penalty of the Cornelian Law is imposed upon anyone who does so. The Senate and
the Emperors very rarely pardon anyone who requests it, when he attempts to
excuse himself on the
called tytvboiiaprvpiabe in force against those who bear, or suborn false
witnesses." (Potter, Antiquities of Greece XXVI, Sec. 19.)
Forgery, as a branch of the crimen falsi,was formerly punished in Scotland by
the amputation of the hand. The offence was afterwards made capital.
(VideErskine, Principles of the Law of Scotland IV, IV, 34.)
The sentence for perjury was confiscation, imprisonment for a year and a day,
infamy, and incapacity to again testify in court. (VideMackenzie, The Laws and
Customes of Scotland in Matters Criminal I, XXIX.)
In the United'States, as in England, unless special statutory provisions have
been enacted declaring prosecution of forgery at Common Law abolished, it may
be instituted. Where certain kinds of forgery have been defined as felonies,
those not enumerated are still punished as misdemeanors under the Common Law.
(VideWharton, A Treatise on Criminal Law, Sec. 859.)
The same rule, to a certain extent, applies to perjury. "Perjury is at common
law simply a misdemeanor. And false swearing, when not technically perjury,
may, nevertheless, be at Common Law indictable as an independent misdemeanor,
when the oath is taken to affect a judicial right." (Ibid.,Sec. 1508.)ED.

Maximus, Consul for the second time, and ^Elianus, 224.
4. The Same Emperor to Crescens.
Any legacies which a husband wrote with his own hand in the will of his wife
are held not to have been written, and the penalty of the Cornelian Law will
apply if pardon is not obtained.
Published on the third of the Nonesof February, during the Consulate of Fuscus,
Consul for the second time, and Dexter, 226.
5. The Same Emperor to the Soldier Gallieniis.
The slave whom you mentioned in the will of your fellow-soldier, by his order,
as having been left to you, is considered as not bequeathed, and therefore you
cannot claim the legacy. The penalty of the Cornelian Law, however, so far as
you are concerned, is remitted through My indulgence, for I think that you were
rather mistaken than guilty of malice.
Published on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of
Fuscus, Consul for the second time, and Dexter, 226.
6. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Aufidiiis.
If you, under the direction of your master, wrote with your own hand in his
will that you were to obtain your freedom, and as you state that your master
did not sign the will, and did not expressly admit, by any written instrument,
that you were entitled to your freedom, the terms of the Decree of the Senate
oppose your receiving it. You are, however, released from the penalty of
forgery, as you could not antagonize your master.

Diocletian, Consul for the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third
time, 290.
TITLE XXXXIIVV..CONCERNING COUNTERFEIT MONEY.
1. The Emperor Constantine to Jamiarius.
As certain makers of counterfeit money are perpetrating their crime in secret,
all persons are notified that they are required to detect men of this kind, so
that their guilt having been ascertained, they may be delivered up to the
judge, and immediately be put to torture to compel them to reveal their
accomplices, and then be punished as they deserve. We grant immunity to their
accusers, and as their civil conditions vary, rules are hereby established by
Us with reference to each of these.
If any soldier should permit a criminal of this description, who has been
arrested, to escape, he shall be punished with death; and anyone
not a soldier, who is guilty of such an offence, shall be denied the right of
appeal. If a soldier, or an officer, should himself commit this crime, he shall
be brought before competent judges with due regard to his rank.
Any house or field where counterfeiting has taken place shall be confiscated to
the Treasury, and if the owner was in the neighborhood, he shall be punished
for carelessness or neglect, even if he was not aware of the commission of that
offence, unless being ignorant in the beginning, he divulged the crime as soon
as he found it out; for, in this instance, his land or his house will not be
liable to confiscation.
When, however, he was at a great distance from his house or his land at the
time, he will sustain no injury, but the agent in charge of the property, the
slaves, the tenants, or the serfs, whose services are employed in its
management, together with the individual who actually perpetrated the offence,
shall be capitally punished.
We, however, consider widows and minors worthy of special indulgence, and
direct that widows, who may have been in the vicinity, should not be deprived
of their houses or lands, if they themselves were in no way implicated in so
serious a crime. Moreover, children under the age of puberty, even if they are
accomplices, shall not suffer any loss, because their age, which renders them
deficient in judgment, release them from liability. But if their guardians are
in the neighborhood, they will incur the penalty, for they should not be
ignorant of what their wards are doing; and if they are solvent, as much of
their property shall be forfeited to the Treasury as their wards would have
been compelled to pay had they been convicted.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof December, during the second Consulate of
the Cassars, Crispus and Constantine, 521.
2. The Same Emperor to TertuUus, Prefect of the City.
When anyone makes counterfeit money, We order that his entire property shall be
confiscated to Our Treasury, for We wish that money shall be coined only in Our
mints. Those who are guilty of counterfeiting have committed high treason, and
a reward is promised to their accusers. Whenever a counterfeiter of solidi,or
anyone who has placed them in circulation, is convicted, he shall instantly,
and without delay, be put to death by fire.1
Given at Milan, on the day before the Nonesof July, during the Consulate of
Constantine, Consul for the seventh time, and Con-stantius, 326.
1 The classification of this offence, as well as its mode of punishment, was
borrowed directly by England from the Civil Law. It was specifically made
treasonable by the Stat. De Proditionibus,25 Ed. Ill, 5, 2 (Wingate, An Exact
Abridgment of all the Statutes, Page 627), prior to which time no clear or
precise definition of the most serious crime against the state had been
formulated. Counterfeiting the King's seal or money, had, however, always been
treason at Common Law, under the title of crimen falsi. (VideGlanvil, Tractatus
de Legibus & Con-suetudinibus Regni Anglia}I, II, XIV, Vill.)

multiplex est: vt si quis falsauerit sigillum domini regis, vel monetam

3. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Rufinus, Prsetorian
Prefect.
If anyone should extort the privilege of coining money, either by virtue of a
rescript or a permit issued by Us, he shall not only lose the benefit of the
permission which he has obtained, but will also suffer the penalty which he
deserves.
Given at Constantinople, on the Idesof July, during the Consulate of
Theodosius, Consul for the third time, and Abundantius, 393.
TITLE XXV. CONCERNING THE CHANGE OF NAME.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Julian.
As in the beginning, private individuals have the right, for the purpose of
recognition, to give their children such names and surnames as they may desire,
so a change of name does not prejudice innocent persons. Therefore, if you are
a freeman, you can legally change your name or surname without committing a
fraud; and you are not forbidden to do so in accordance with the laws which
have been frequently enacted on this subject, and your rights will not, on this
account, be prejudiced in the future.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
TITLE XXVI.
ON THE JULIAN LAW RELATING TO POLITICAL CORRUPTION.
1. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Pompeianus, Prefect of the City.
Let no one presume to again apply for the office of commander, enumerator,
jailer, or any other employment, as one term of these is
fabricauerit & huiusmodi."(Bracton, De Legibus & Consuetudinibus AnglixIII,
118b.)
Coke remarks with reference to the above-mentioned statute, "The forging of the
king's coine is high treason, without utterance of it, for by this act the
counterfeiting is made high treason." (Institutes III, I, Page 16.)
Even so late as 1721, a woman was, under circumstances of incredible atrocity,
publicly burnt at Tyburn for coining. (VidePike, A History of Crime in England,
Vol. II, Page 288.)
The Anglo-Saxon law, suggestive of the Lex Talionis,imposed the penalty ol
amputation without the right to commute it. "He who after this shall make false
(money), let him forfeit the hands with which he wrought that false, and not
redeem them with anything neither with gold nor with silver." (Ancient Laws and
Institutes of England, Laws of King Cnut, Sec. 8.)
By the old Scotch law, the property of anyone guilty of falsun,or
counterfeiting, was confiscated, and he was either burnt or hanged. (Mackenzie,
The Laws and Customes of Scotland in Matters Criminal I, XXXVI, Page 383.)ED.
sufficient for the public welfare. If anyone of such persons should, by means
of an Imperial Rescript, fraudulently acquire an office a second time, what he
obtained in this way shall be considered as void, and he shall be held to a
strict accountability for the acts which he performed during his previous
administration.
Those who violate this law shall be sentenced to the penalty of deportation, in
accordance with the terms of the Lex Julia,relating to political corruption.
Given at Milan, on the day before the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of
Stilicho and Aurelian, 400.
TITLE XXVII. ON THE JULIAN LAW RELATING TO EXTORTION.
1. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Matro-nianus, Duke and
Governor of Sardinia.
In order that the penalty inflicted upon one person may strike many others with
fear, We order that a duke who has been guilty of extortion shall be sent,
under a sufficient guard, into the province which he plundered, and be
compelled against his will to pay not only fourfold the value of what he
himself extorted or took from the inhabitants of Our province, but also of
anything which the members of his household and his soldiers and attendants may
have obtained in this manner.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Idesof June, during the
Consulate of Antoninus and Syagrius, 382.
2. The Same Emperors to Florus, Praetorian Prefect.
All judges are notified that, so far as their own extortions are concerned, the
pecuniary penalties imposed cannot only be collected from them, but also from
their heirs.
Given on the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of Antoninus and
Syagrius, 382.
3. The Same Emperors to Marcellinus.
All magistrates and judges are hereby notified that they must keep their hands
off of the money and estates belonging to litigants, and not think that the
controversies of others may be a source of plunder for themselves, for judges
and traders in private litigation are liable to the penalties prescribed by the
laws.
Given at Milan, on the day before the Nonesof April, during the Consulate of
Merobaudus, Consul for the second time, and Saturninus, 383.
4. The Same Emperors and Arcadius, Edict Addressed to the Inhabitants of the
Provinces.
We order, and We urge that if any public official, decurion, landlord, and
finally any vassal or person of any rank whatever, should have been, in any
way, harassed by a judge, or if anyone should know
that a judicial decree was obtained by the use of money, or that a penalty was
remitted through a reward, or with the hope of gain, or where anyone can
afterwards establish the dishonesty of a judge in any case, he must denounce
him, and furnish evidence in support of his accusation, either during his
administration, or after he has relinquished his office; and, if he should
prove the crime, he shall be honored and glorified for having done so.
Given at Constantinople, on the tenth of the Kalendsof July, during the
Consulate of the Noble Prince Honorius, and Evodius, 386.
5. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Sever-inus, Count of
Private Affairs.
Let every Attorney of the Crown, Steward of the Royal Household, secretary,
collector, or tenant of anyone, who remembers that the Count of Our Private
Affairs has extorted money from him, and he to whom he paid it has retired from
office, demand what he paid before Your Excellency, within the term of one
year, and whatever he refunds shall be credited on his account.
When, however, the prescribed time has elapsed from the date of his laying
aside his office, no accusation of this kind shall be heard, but We decree that
the Attorneys themselves, the Stewards, the tenants, the secretaries, and the
collectors aforesaid shall be held liable for payment.
Given at Milan, on the day before the Nonesof June, during the Consulate of
Valentinian, Consul for the fourth time, and Neoterius, 290.
6. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Florentinus, Prsetorian Prefect.
We order that men shall be selected for the government of provinces whose lives
are honorable, and who are not attracted to the office by ambition or the
desire for gain, but who are deemed worthy of promotion by Your Excellency, so
that those who are chosen for the place by yourself or by Us, having been
sworn, may state that they have not given anything in order to obtain the
office to which they have been appointed, and that they will never in the
future give anything, either themselves, or by other persons for that purpose,
in violation of the law, and of their oath, nor enter into an agreement of this
kind, by way of a sale or donation, or under any other pretext.
They should also swear that, with the exception of their salaries, they will
not accept anything whatever during their administration, or after they have
relinquished their office, in consideration of any favor which they may bestow
during their term, and which they should grant without reward.
And although We believe that no one, by violating his oath, will forget the
fear of God, and prefer some present advantage to his own salvation, still, in
order that the danger of punishment may be added to the fear of Divine
retribution, We grant to all persons the right of accusation, as of a public
crime, where any official dares to
disregard the oath which he has taken, and this applies not only to him who
received the presents but also to him who gave them; and anyone convicted of
this crime shall be fined quadruple the value of what was given or received.1
Given at Constantinople, on the sixth of the Kalendsof December during the
Consulate of Theodosius, Consul for the seventeenth time and Festus, 439.
TITLE XXVIII. CONCERNING THE CRIME OF EMBEZZLEMENT.
1. The Emperors Honorius and, Theodosius to Rufinus, Prsetorian Prefect.
Judges who misappropriate public money during their administration incur the
penalty imposed by the Lex Juliarelating to embezzlement, and We order that
they shall suffer capital punishment, and that those shall be subjected to the
same penalty who are guilty of complicity with them, or who knowingly received
the property misappropriated by them.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifth of the Nonesof March, during the
Consulate of Honorius, Consul for the tenth time, and Theodosius, Consul for
the sixth time, 415.
TITLE XXXXIIXX..CONCERNING THE CRIME OF SACRILEGE.
1. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Eutro-pius, Prsetorian
Prefect.
Those who fail to observe, or violate the sanctity of the Divine Law and offend
either through ignorance or neglect, commit sacrilege.
Given at Thessalonica, on the third of the Kalendsof March, during the
Consulate of Gratian, Consul for the fifth time, and Theodosius, 380.
2. This Law is not Authentic.
3. The Same Emperors to Symmachus, Prefect of the City.
The conduct of the Emperor should not be discussed, for it is the same as
sacrilege to doubt whether he whom the sovereign selects for an office is
worthy or not.
Given at Milan, on the fifth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Richomer and Clearchus, 384.
1 This offence has been defined as follows: "Extortio est crimen quando quis
colore offcii extorquet quod non est debitum, vel supra debitum, vel ante
tempus quod est debitum."ED.
4. The Same Emperors and Arcadius to Eutropius, Prsetorian Prefect.
Let no one think that he who desires to receive and administer an office, in
the same province in which he is both an inhabitant and a citizen, is not
guilty of sacrilege, unless the Emperor himself has voluntarily granted someone
this privilege by a rescript.1
Given on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of
Arcadius and Bauto, 385.


TITLE XXX.
CONCERNING SEDITIOUS PERSONS, AND THOSE WHO DARE TO ASSEMBLE THE PEOPLE AGAINST
THE GOVERNMENT.

1. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Floren-tius,
Augustal Prsetorian Prefect.
If anyone should attempt to stir up the populace contrary to the plain
provisions of the law enacted on this subject, and resist the public
authorities, he shall be subjected to the severest punishment.  Given
at Constantinople, on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof January, during
the Consulate of Richomer and Clearchus, 384.

2. The Emperor Leo to Erythrius, Prsetorian Prefect.
No seditious speeches shall be made with tumultuous clamor in any city or
elsewhere, nor shall any offensive words be uttered against any official of the
government; and those who make such speeches and incite such tumults are hereby
notified that they will, under no circumstances, obtain anything which they
demand, but that, on the other hand, they will be liable to the penalties which
the ancient laws provide against the authors of seditions and tumults.
Given at Constantinople, on the second of the Nonesof March, during the
Consulate of Leo, Consul for the sixth time, 474.
TITLE XXXI.
WHEN A CIVIL ACTION CANNOT BE BROUGHT AT THE
SAME TIME ALONG WITH A CRIMINAL PROSECUTION, AND
WHETHER BOTH PROCEEDINGS CAN BE INSTITUTED BY
THE SAME PERSON.
1. The Emperors Valens, Gratian, and Valentinian to Antony, Prsetorian Prefect.
It has been generally laid down by a majority of jurists that whenever both a
criminal and a civil action will lie in a private matter, both of them can be
brought, no matter which may first be instituted; and when the civil action has
not been filed, the criminal one can be,
1 A person guilty of sacrilege was considered by the Romans as worse than a
thief. "Sacrilegus omnium prsedonum cupiditatem et scelera superat."ED.
and vice versa.Hence, if anyone has been forcibly dispossessed of property, and
for the purpose of recovering it has made use of the interdict Unde vi,it is
still not forbidden to bring a criminal accusation under the Julian Law
relating to public violence. And where a will has been suppressed, and
proceedings have been begun under the edict providing for its production, a
criminal prosecution is authorized by the Cornelian Law having reference to
wills.
When a freedman alleges that he is freeborn, he can be prosecuted civilly on
account of the services due to his patron, as well as criminally under the
Viscellian Law. Under this head also is classed the action of theft, as well as
that created by the Fabian Law.
There are many other instances which cannot be enumerated here : where when one
action is brought first, it is lawful to try the case again by having recourse
to another. According to this statement of the law, there is no doubt that the
crime of forgery, which has already been made the subject of a civil action,
can also be prosecuted criminally.
Given on the day before the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of Valens,
Consul for the sixth time, and Valentinian, Consul for the second time, 378.
TITLE XXXII. CONCERNING THE CRIME OP PLUNDERING AN ESTATE.
1. The Emperors S&verus and Antoninus to Euphrata.
You cannot prosecute your co-heir for the crime of plundering the estate when
you acknowledged that, after having examined the property in the common chest,
the keys of the same were delivered to him. When a demand is made to produce
the property in court, he cannot be compelled to adjust his accounts, for after
the property for which the demand was made has been produced, the decision of
the controversy should be left to the proper judges.
Published on the twelfth of the Kalendsof May, during the second Consulate of
Antoninus and Geta, 206.
2. The Emperor Antoninus to Primus.
You are not prevented from prosecuting your step-father for the crime of
plundering the estate, before the Governor of the province.
Published on the seventh of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of
Lsetus, Consul for the second time, and Cerealis, 216.
_^
3. The Same Emperor to Helena.
If you have entered on the estate of your grandfather, you will not be
prevented from prosecuting your step-mother for the crime of plundering the
estate.
Published on the third of the Nonesof January, during the Consulate of Sabinus,
and Anulinus, 217.
4. The Emperor Gordian to Bassus.
The heirs of a deceased husband cannot prosecute his widow for the crime of
plundering his estate (as she is, both humanly and divinely speaking, the
partner of her husband). Therefore you can sue for the property, which you
allege she has abstracted, by bringing the proper action in rem;or, if she has
been guilty of fraud in order to avoid having possession of the chattels, you
can compel her to produce them, and she cannot acquire the ownership of the
income of any property which she retained in bad faith, for although she is not
liable to prosecution for the crime of plundering the estate, there is no doubt
whatever that the income from the same can be recovered by a suit if it is in
existence, and if it has been consumed, a personal action may be brought for
its value.
Published on the sixth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Atticus
and Praetextatus, 243.
5. The Emperor Philip and the Csesar Philip to Simplicius.
Legatees, even when they were the freedmen of the deceased, cannot be deprived
of the benefit of their legacies, under the pretext that the estate has been
plundered, especially when the case has not been heard.
Published on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of
Philip and Titian, 246.
6. The Same Emperor and Csesar to Basilia.
It is a well-settled rule of law that the crime of plundering an estate can be
prosecuted, even where a civil action for the same cause has failed.
Published on the tenth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of
^milianus and Aquilinus, 250.
TITLE XXXIII. CONCERNING PROPERTY CARRIED OFF BY VIOLENCE.
1. The Emperor Gordian to Valerius.
It is an established principle of law that an action brought for the recovery
of property carried away by violence, and which includes a penalty, has
reference rather to property which is movable and can move itself than to land
illegally occupied.
Published on the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Atticus and
Praetextatus, 243.
2. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus to Longinus.
If the heir of the donor forcibly deprived you of the movable property, whose
ownership you acquired by a legal donation, you have the right to bring suit
for quadruple damages on the ground of property taken by violence, within a
year; and, after that time, you will not be prevented from bringing an action
for simple damages.
Published on the seventh of ... May, during the Consulate of Secularus and
Donatus, 261.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars, to Evelpistus.
It is settled that a creditor who forcibly removes property which has been
pledged to him does not perform a lawful act, but commits a crime, and there is
no doubt that he can be sued for quadruple damages on the ground of having
carried away the property by violence within the available year, or for simple
damages after the year has expired.
Ordered at Sirmium, on the seventh of the Kalendsof January, during the
Consulate of the above-mentioned Emperors.
4. The Same Emperors and Ciesars to Attains.
With reference to property which a slave belonging to another is said to have,
removed by violence, without the knowledge of his master, the latter can be
sued for quadruple damages in a noxal action on this ground before a competent
court within a year, and, after that time, an action for simple damages can be
brought against him.
Ordered at Heraclia, on the second of the Kalendsof May, under the Consulate of
the above-mentioned Emperors.
5. The Same Emperors and C&sars to Domna.
Whether you think that you should proceed against your stepmother in an action
based on voluntary agency, or in one for the forcible removal of property, by
means of which quadruple damages can be recovered within the available year,
and similar damages afterwards; you can bring your suit before the Governor.
Ordered at Philippopolis, on the sixth of the Nonesof July, during the
Consulate of the above-mentioned Emperors.
TITLE XXXIV. CONCERNING THE CRIME OP SWINDLING.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Alexander.
You acknowledge that you have committed a dishonorable and criminal act by
having pledged the same property to several persons, and that, when contracting
the last obligation, you concealed the fact that the said property was already
encumbered to others. You will provide for your security, and avoid prosecution
for crime, if you pay your debts to all your creditors.
Published on the fifth of the Idesof February, during the Consulate of
Pompeianus and Pelignus, 232.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Valens.
If your father gave you a donation, and, at the time when you were emancipated,
transferred to you by delivery the ownership of the said property, and
afterwards hypothecated it to his creditor as his
own, without your consent, he does not prejudice your rights, nor can he be
prosecuted for the crime of swindling, because of knowingly encumbering to his
creditor as his own, and without your consent, property which he knew belonged
to another.
Published on the second of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Gordian and Aviola, 240.
3. The Same Emperor to Hadrian.
Swindling should not be included among public crimes. Published on the Idesof
April, during the Consulate of Atticus and Prsetextatus, 243.
4. The Emperor Philip to Eutropius.
Advantage cannot be taken of the ignorance of a creditor without incurring the
risk of punishment, where property encumbered to him has already been legally
pledged or hypothecated to another; for fraudulent acts of this description
should be regarded as unusual offences, and it has been repeatedly stated in
rescripts that swindling must be severely punished. Hence your debtor either
attempted to take advantage of your ignorance, or, if the obligation was
legally contracted, he fraudulently tried to deprive you of your right by
conniving with a person for this purpose, whom he pretended to have a prior
lien on the property pledged; and you can appear before the court having
jurisdiction which will render a decision in conformity with law and equity.
Published on the sixth of the Idesof May, during the Consulate of Peregrinus
and .^Emilianus, 245.
TITLE XXXV. CONCERNING INJURIES.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Syrus.
It is not lawful to injure the slaves of others.
Published on the eleventh of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of
Alexander.
2. The Same Emperor to Clavus.
The action for injury will lie in your favor for two reasons: first, because a
husband is understood to have some regard for his wife's reputation for
chastity; and second, because a father is considered to sustain damage when the
character of his daughter is assailed.

and Clement, 231.
3. The Emperor Gordian to Donatus.
If you did not denounce anyone, you should have no fear that your reputation
has been damaged, because certain persons, with the intention of injuring you,
have called you an informer; and, further-
more, you can bring an action for injury in the usual way against those who are
ascertained to have done anything -for the purpose of reflecting upon your
character.
Published on the second of the Idesof July, during the Consulate of Gordian and
Aviola, 240.
4. The Emperors Valerian, Gallienus, and the Csesar Valerian to Vindius.
It is perfectly clear that an atrocious injury has been committed, if at the
time when this was done you were in the exercise of your duty as priest, and
wore the habit and the ornaments of your profession; and therefore you can
bring a criminal prosecution in order to obtain redress.
Published on the second of . . . , during the Consulate of Mmili-anus and
Bassus, 260.
5. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Cazsars, to Victorinus.
If you can prove that you did not intentionally make use of any abusive
expression, the truth of this fact will protect you from an accusation of
slander. If, however, during a quarrel, and while inflamed with anger, you
accused someone of homicide, and twelve months have elapsed since that time, as
an action for injury committed is barred by prescription after the expiration
of a year, you cannot be sued on that ground.
Published on the sixth of the Idesof July, during the Consulate of Diocletian,
Consul for the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third time, 290.
6. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Flavianus.
As the justice of the law does not permit patrons to commit injuries against
their freedmen, and you state that the heirs of your patron have injured one
who received his freedom from the defunct, the Governor of the province will
see that the insults of the heirs cease.
Published on the Idesof July, during the Consulate of Diocletian, Consul for
the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third time, 290. j
7. The Same Emperors and Caesars to Potentianus.
The commission of injury gives rise to a private action, and not to a criminal
prosecution.
Ordered at Sirmium, on the Idesof February, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors.
8. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Martian.
It is established that a master can bring suit for an atrocious injury suffered
by his slave, in accordance with the terms of the Perpetual Edict, by which it
is plainly stated that an action for damages will lie.
Ordered on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of the
above-mentioned Emperors.
9. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Nonna.
There is no doubt that persons who, for the purpose of rendering them infamous,
have stated that the children of a certain individual were slaves, can be sued
in an action of injury.
Ordered at Nicomedia, on the sixth of the Kalendsof December, during the
Consulate of the above-mentioned Emperors.
10. The Same Emperors and Csssars to Paulus.
If Zenodorus (for the purpose of defaming her) said that your grandmother was a
female slave, belonging to the City of the Coman-.ensians, and did nothing
more, an action for injury committed can immediately be brought against him.
If, however, he persists in his assertion, you have the right to defend
yourself in court, and then, if your grandmother should not be decided to be a
slave, it is settled that you can bring your suit*
Ordered at Nicomedia, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the
Consulate of the Csesars.
11. The Emperor Zeno to Alexander, a Man of Illustrious Rank.
When the criminal action for the commission of injury which the ancient legal
authorities included among private offences is brought by persons of
illustrious rank, whether they hold any office or not, or by their wives, their
sons, or their daughters (of course, during .the lifetime of their fathers or
husbands), or if it should be brought against any person of this description,
We decree that the said persons shall file their complaints in writing, and
solemnly observe all the other legal formalities which are usually complied
with in such cases. The illustrious accuser or defendant, or his wife, or
children of either sex shall, during the lifetime of their parents, have the
right to defend themselves, or file the accusation in a criminal case for
injury in any court having jurisdiction, by an attorney; and the judge shall
render his decision according to law against the party who appointed the
attorney, even if he himself was not present in court, but tried the case by
his attorney, provided, however, that no one else shall be so bold as to claim
this privilege for himself, or to ask Us to grant it; but with respect to
others, the practice of the courts which has been observed up to the present
time shall prevail hereafter.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifth of the Nonesof November, during the
Consulate of Illus, 478.
TITLE XXXVI. CONCERNING DEFAMATORY LIBELS.
1. Edict of the Emperors Valentinian and Valens.If anyone should find a
defamatory libel in a house, in a public place, or anywhere else, without
knowing who placed it there, he must
either tear it up before anyone else finds it, or not mention to anyone that he
has done so. If, however, he should not immediately tear up, or burn the paper,
but should show it to others, he is notified that he will be liable to the
punishment of death as the author.
Where anyone having a view to his own duty or to the preservation of the public
safety mentions the name of the culprit, and states with his own mouth what he
thought reprehensible in the libel aforesaid, let him be under no
apprehensions, for if the truth should be established by his assertions, he
will be entitled to the greatest praise, as well as to a reward from Us. If,
however, he should not be able to prove the truth of his statements, he shall
be punished with death.1
A libel of this kind does not injure the reputation of another.
1 The famosus libellusof Roman jurisprudence belonged to the class of injuries,
Aword of indefinite signification referring to acts implying malice and having
a direct tendency to damage someone either in person or reputation. An injury
might be actual, such as assault and battery; or verbal, as slanderous
expressions, bringing their object into public contempt. It, in.many respects,
corresponds to our "tort," and was defined by the ancient authorities, in
general terms, as everything illegally done: "Omne quod non jure fit."
The Laws of the Twelve Tables authorized the enforcement of the Lex Talionisin
the case of serious injury, where it was possible; and when it was
comparatively slight, established a regular schedule of indemnities, the least
of which was twenty-five asses. (LegesXII TabularumVII, VII.) This, however,
was ultimately abrogated by the equitable jurisdiction of the Praetor, who
permitted a civil or criminal action for damages to be instituted, the amount
of which was fixed by the plaintiff himself, subject to revision by the court,
who, if he thought best, could either allow or diminish it. "Index uel tanti
condemnat quanti nos xstimauerimus, uel minoris, prout ei uisum fuerit."
It was essential for malice to be proved in an action for slander or libel, and
if the truth of the statements which formed the basis of the suit could be
proved by the defendant, he was permitted to do so.
Many of the verses and inscriptions, known as graffiti,as well as the
caricatures, left by the scribbling populace of Roman cities upon the walls of
public buildings for the amusement and edification of posterity, although often
of an undoubtedly libelous character, were never removed by the authorities,
who seem to have manifested a singular indifference towards insults and
defamation when published in this manner. These were the precursors of the
pasquinades of more recent times.
No suit would lie where the alleged injury was not intentional, was the result
of a mistake, or originated in an act of pleasantry. But even a mere gesture,
if obviously designed to cast opprobrium or insult upon anyone, was actionable,
although no words whatever may have accompanied it. Under the Lex Cornelia, de
injuriis,the injured person could proceed both civilly and criminally where the
act complained of was of a peculiarly violent or atrocious character. The right
of action De injuriawas transmitted to heirs, where joinder of issue had taken
place before the death of the plaintiff.
A gesture of contempt, without sufficient cause, incurred severe retribution
among the Babylonians. "If a man point the finger at a priestess or the wife of
another and cannot justify it, they shall draw that man before the judge and
they shall brand his forehead." (The Code of Hammurabi, Sec. 127.)
That species of Lex Talioniswhich deprived a man of the member with which he
committed the offence was a popular and effective penalty in antiquity.
The Hindus punished abuse of a magistrate with amputation of the tongue,
confiscation of property, and banishment. In all other cases of slander a fine
was imposed, which varied with the rank and caste of the offender. (Gentoo Code
XV. I, II.)
Given at Constantinople, on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof March, during the
Consulate of Valentinian and Valens, 363.
TITLE XXXVII. CONCERNING CATTLE THIEVES.
1. The Emperors Honorius and Arcadius to Pasiphilus.
The accusation of a cattle thief not only can be made in writing, but can also
be instituted without that formality.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of Olybrius
and Promotus, 395.
With the Saxons, the burden of proof, showing damage to property, rested on the
complainant, and injury to reputation was not taken into account. "And he who
shall accuse another wrongfully, so that he, either in money or in prosperity,
be the worse, if then the other can disprove that which anyone would charge to
him, be he liable in his tongue, unless he make him compensation with his
'wer.' " (Ancient Laws and Institutes of England; The Laws of King Edgar II,
4.)
Libel, as a specific offence, is not recognized by Mohammedans, and slander is
limited to direct accusations, or insinuations relating to sexual misconduct,
such as adultery, promiscuous illicit intercourse, and, under certain
restrictions, illegitimacy. (The Hedaya II, VII, V.)
While the law of libel was known to the early English legal writers, the
offence was not considered one of a serious nature, but is designated a
misdemeanor. Bracton places it among minora et leviora crimina,but says little
or nothing about this breach of the law, or its punishment. It was not until
the reign of Charles I that prosecutions for it assumed a definite form, and
they were principally directed against those who, with evidently malicious
intent, had attacked the government, the King, or his ministers. Such cases
were tried in the Star Chamber, and involved imprisonment, fine, exposure in
the pillory, and loss of ears. (VideStephen, A History of the Criminal Law of
England II, XXIV, Page 305.)
The present English law, based on the Libel Acts, pays special attention to
seditious libels, and such as are designed or published with a view to
extortion. Malicious defamatory libels are punished by a fine to be fixed by
the court, or by imprisonment not to exceed one year. (VideStephen,
Commentaries of the Laws of England IV, IV, IV, 11.)
Criminal libel is thus defined by American jurists. "A defamatory libel is
matter published without legal justification or excuse, the effect of which is
to insult the person of whom it is published, or which is calculated to injure
the reputation of any person by exposing him to hatred, contempt, or ridicule."
(Wharton, Criminal Law, Sec. 1915.) Anything which, when made the ground of a
civil action, would be considered libelous without demanding special damage is
indictable, as are also blasphemy, or obscene pictures or writings. Mere
observation by a third party is sufficient to constitute publication. While at
Common Law truth was not a justification, and could not be set up as a defence,
the rule is now different both in England and the United States. "The
publication of a libel is not a misdemeanor if the defamatory matter is true,
and if the publisher can show that it was for the public benefit that such
matter should be published." (Ibid.,Sec. 1968.) Where, however, malice exists,
this principle is not applicable. (Videalso Ibid.,Secs. 1919, 1926, 1927,
1940.)
Libelous or slanderous statements published against the sovereign or officials
of the government are generally, in the countries of continental Europe,
classed as instances of lese majesty,and punished accordingly. When a private
person is the object of such attacks, the penalty is, of course, not nearly so
severe.ED.
TITLE XXXVIII.
CONCERNING THE PROHIBITION OF DAMAGING THE LEVEES OF THE NILE.
1. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Anthemius, Praetorian Prefect.
If anyone should hereafter, contrary to the ancient practice observed
throughout Egypt, seize land left by the overflow of the Nile, within twelve
cubits from the bank of the said river, in violation of the peculiar and
ancient customs of that country, he shall be burned to death in the place in
which he displayed his want of reverence for antiquity, and, to a certain
extent, attacked the security of the Empire itself. His accomplices and
companions shall be sentenced to deportation, and without ever being granted
permission to obtain pardon, or recover either their citizenship, their rank or
their property.
Given at Constantinople, on the tenth of the Kalendsof October, during the
Consulate of Honorius, Consul for the eighth time, and Theodosius, Consul for
the third time, 409.
TITLE XXXIX.
CONCERNING THOSE WHO CONCEAL ROBBERS OR OTHER CRIMINALS.
1. The Emperors Vcdentinian, Valens, and Gratian to the Vicegerent Simplicius.
Those who conceal persons guilty of crime must expect the same penalty, to
which they have rendered themselves liable by having associated with them, and
anyone who knowingly harbors robbers, and neglects to give them up to justice,
shall, in the discretion of the judge, be punished corporeally, or by a
pecuniary fine, according to his rank.
Published at Rome, on the tenth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of
Gratian, Consul for the third time, and Equitius, 374.
2. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Palladius, Pras-torian Prefect.
When any robbers or other malefactors reside or conceal themselves on the land
of another, the owner of the property (if he is present) or his agents (if he
is absent), or the persons having the control of the same, are obliged to
voluntarily deliver up the said criminals; and if they knowingly should not do
so of their own accord, they shall be notified by the civil authorities to
surrender those who are sought, in order that they may be tried and punished
according to the nature of their offences.
Where, however, the owners of the land or their agents, or those having charge
of the same, do not promptly give them up, then the Governor of the province,
having been applied to, must take all legal measures to arrest them. When a
sufficient force cannot be obtained
to do this, on account of their number, and the above-mentioned malefactors
resist the officers of the law, or otherwise manage to avoid arrest, then the
judge of the province, mindful of his responsibility, shall ask assistance from
the tribune or commanders of the soldiers who are in the neighborhood, in order
that the accused persons, having been seized by the soldiers, may be placed in
the hands of the law, without damage or injury to anyone, and, after
conviction, may undergo suitable penalties.
The judge, however, should not forget that if he requests the aid of soldiers
against one who is innocent, or for any motive than the trial of robbers or
other dangerous persons, or subjects the people of the province to unnecessary
expense, he will be liable to the severest punishment which Your Highness may
determine to be appropriate. If the tribunes, commanders, or other officers,
who are in the neighborhood, after having been notified by the judge, should
refuse to afford assistance, or if any injuries should be inflicted by the
soldiers themselves upon the inhabitants of the provinces, they must make good
all losses and damages, and be punished with the greatest severity besides, in
accordance with the judgment of the illustrious commander-in-chief.
The owners of the land aforesaid, or their agents, or whoever has charge of the
same, shall not go unpunished, if, being present, and aware of the facts, they
do not voluntarily surrender the guilty parties; or, if having been notified,
they delay to produce them; but the proprietor of the land shall be deprived of
his ownership of it, and the agent or superintendent shall be sentenced to
perpetual exile.
When the agents themselves, the owner, or the superintendents of the land,
acknowledge that they are unable to control the multitude of peasants and
criminals aforesaid, and make this statement openly in the tribunal of the
province, the Governor shall cause military aid to be furnished by the tribune
or the other officers, if he should ascertain that the power of the civil
authorities is not sufficient; but when, after the production of the alleged
culprits, it becomes evident that they are innocent, and have committed no
crime, their accuser will be compelled to suffer the punishment inflicted upon
calumniators, for it establishes a bad precedent to seek for robbers, and by
doing so place innocent persons in jeopardy.
Given at Constantinople, on the twelfth of the Kalendsof January, during the
Consulate of Marinianus, and Asclepiodotus, 423.
TITLE XL. CONCERNING THE NOTIFICATION OF ACCUSED PERSONS.
1. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus to Rusticus.
When anyone, who is absent, is charged with serious crimes, sentence is not
usually pronounced against him at once, but he is notified to appear, not for
the purpose of being punished, but that an opportunity may be afforded him to
clear himself, provided he can do so.
If, after having been notified, he should return within a year and clear
himself of the crime, he shall receive his property which has been sealed by
order of court. When, however, he returns within the prescribed time after
having been notified, and dies before establishing his innocence, he will
transmit his property to his heirs.
Given at . . . , during the Consulate of Tuscus and Bassus, 212.
2. The Emperor Constantine to Jamiarius.
Anyone who refuses to appear in court within a year from the time that he was
charged with a crime shall have his property confiscated to the Treasury, and
if he should afterwards be found and convicted, he must be given a more severe
sentence, and even if he should prove his innocence by clear and satisfactory
evidence, his property will, nevertheless, remain in possession of the
Treasury.
Given on the Idesof January, and adopted at Corinth, on the fifth of the
Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Constantine, Consul for the fifth
time, and the Caesar Licinius, 319.
3. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Palladius, Prsetorian Prefect.
In cases involving the payment of money, the Edict promulgated against a person
who remains concealed does not affect his reputation, but a criminal proceeding
brings such censure under the law that he who is accused not only cannot
transfer his estate, but his good name is also injured.
Given at Ravenna, on the seventh of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of
Eustachius and Agricola, 421.
TITLE XLI. CONCERNING TORTURE.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus to Antiana.
Slaves should not be subjected to torture against their masters except in cases
of adultery, accusations of fraud having reference to taxation, and the crime
of high treason, which involves the safety of the Emperor. So far as other
offences are concerned, although judges should not formulate hurriedly a
decision based on testimony given by a slave against his master, still, if the
truth is established by other testimony, an exception cannot be pleaded. It is,
however, clear that, in pecuniary cases, slaves should be interrogated against
their masters, where other evidence is lacking.
Published on the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of Fuscus, Consul for
the second time, and Dexter, 197.
2. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Catullus.
It is unusual, and furnishes a bad precedent, for slaves to be heard against
their guardians, or the mother of their master, unless the administration of
the guardianship is involved.
Published on the third of the Idesof September, during the Consulate of Chilo
and Libo, 205.
3. The Emperor Antoninus When Deciding a Case, Said:Slaves belonging to another
should first be interrogated under torture, when there is sufficient evidence
that a crime of such atrocity has been perpetrated; and the woman herself may
afterwards be put to the question, for it is not inhuman for her to be tortured
who destroyed her husband by poison.
Published on the seventh of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of
Sabinus and Anulinus, 217.
4. Extract from a Rescript of the Emperor Antoninus.
As too much reliance should not be placed on the statements of criminals who,
having been convicted, allege that those by whom they were arrested and kept in
custody are their accomplices, so, if it is clearly proved that they only
divulged the crime committed in common for the purpose of avoiding the penalty,
they shall not escape public
punishment.
Published on the fifth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate
of Sabinus and Anulinus, 217.
5. The Emperor Alexander to Respectus.
Slaves who have obtained their freedom by the last will of a testator should
not be indiscriminately subjected to torture, even where his death should be
avenged.
Published on the sixth of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Sabinus and
Venustus, 241.
6. The Emperor Gordian to Herodian.
It was long since decided that slaves or freedmen ought not to be tortured in
cases having reference to the domestic affairs of their owners, or patrons, as
what might be obtained by their confessions would not have the force of truth
either for or against them, in capital or pecuniary cases.
Published on the seventh of the Idesof May, during the Consulate
of Sabinus and Venustus, 241.
7. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Urbana.
If the slaves have been proved without doubt to belong to you, We do not permit
them to be put to torture, even though you suggest that this be done; and, so
far from doing so, We are unwilling that they should be compelled to violate
their fidelity to their mistress, even against your consent.
Published on the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of Maximus, Consul
for the second time, and Aquilinus, 286.
8. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Sallust, Governor.We do not permit soldiers
to be subjected to torture, or to the penalties imposed upon plebeians in
criminal cases, even when it
appears that they have been dismissed from the service without the privileges
of veterans, with the exception of those who have been dishonorably discharged.
This rule shall also be observed with reference to the sons of soldiers and
veterans.
In the prosecution of public crimes, judges should not begin the investigation
by resorting to torture, but should first avail themselves of all accessible
and probable evidence. If, after having obtained information relative to the
crime, they think that torture should be applied for the purpose of
ascertaining the truth, they only ought to resort to it where the rank of the
persons involved justifies such a course; for, by the terms of this law, all
the inhabitants of the provinces have a right to the benefit of the natural
benevolence which We entertain for them.
Without date or designation of Consulate.
9. The Same Emperors and Csssars to Our Beloved Governor of Syria.
In the investigation of the question of free birth, every form of interrogation
and torture should be resorted to in order that persons of low and debased
origin may not venture to claim for themselves a position among those who are
distinguished and freeborn, and that the succession to which the latter are
entitled may not through a fraudulent assumption be denied to them.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof May, during the Consulate of Diocletian,
Consul for the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third time, 290.
10. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Ptolmseus.
As you allege that the will is forged, the slaves forming part of the estate
may, under the Constitutions of the Emperors, be put to torture, even though
they were granted freedom by the person who asserts that he is the heir.
Published on the sixth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of
Diocletian, Consul for the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third
time, 290.
11. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Boethus.
It was decided by the Divine Marcus that the descendants of men who are
designated "Most Eminent and most Perfect," to the degree of great-
grandchildren, shall not be subject either to the penalties or the tortures
inflicted upon plebeians, if no stigma of violated honor attached to those of a
nearer degree, through whom this privilege was transmitted to their
descendants.
The learned jurist Domitius Ulpianus, in his works treating of public law,
states for the knowledge and information of future ages that this rule shall
also be observed with reference to decurions and their children.
Published on the fifth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of
Diocletian, Consul for the fourth time, and Maximian, Consul for the third
time, 291.
12. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Asper.
Whenever the ownership of slaves is involved, and the truth cannot be
ascertained by other evidence, eminent legal authorities hold that the slaves
themselves can be interrogated under torture.
Published at Sirmium, on the third of the Idesof May, during the Consulate of
Tiberianus and Dio.
13. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Philippa.
It can be of no advantage to you for the slaves forming part of the estate to
be tortured in the case in question, as the ownership of the same is not in
dispute; for where it is uncertain who is entitled to it, it is but reasonable
that, in order to ascertain the truth, the slaves belonging to the estate
should be subjected to torture; but, as you assert that the slave is common
property, you should entertain no doubt that half of him belongs to the person
against whom you desire the said slave to be interrogated. This fact presents
an obstacle to the application of torture, as slaves of two joint-owners cannot
be put to the question and interrogated against either of them, except where
one is said to have killed the other.
Ordered at Heraclia, on the third of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of
the above-mentioned Emperors.
14. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Constantine.
It is settled that slaves cannot be tortured any more in favor of their
masters, to whom they now belong, than in favor of those who formerly owned
them.
Ordered on the eighth of the Idesof April, during the Consulate
of the Csesars.
15. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Maximus.
There is no doubt that slaves can be put to torture on account of acts
committed by them, not only in criminal cases, but also in those involving the
payment of money, where property is entrusted to them for deposit or loan, or
for other purposes authorized by law.
Ordered on the fifth of the Idesof April, during the Consulate of the Csesars.
16. The Emperors Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian to Antonius, Prsetorian
Prefect of the Gauls.
We desire decurions to be absolutely exempt from the suffering inflicted by
instruments of torture, not only with reference to the debts of others, but
also on account of their own. If any magistrate should attempt to insult the
Order of Decurions in this manner, he shall be put to death. This severe
proceeding shall only be permitted in the case of persons belonging to this
municipal order, who are accused of high treason, and who are either
accomplices or principals in this
infamous crime.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof October, during the Con-pulate of
Valens, Consul for the fifth time, and Valentinian, 376.
17. The Emperors Arcadiiis and Honorius to Messala, Prsetorian Prefect.
Let every magistrate understand that he cannot, when inflamed with resentment,
deviate from the course of justice; nor, if influenced by bribery, inflict
corporeal injury by torturing persons who are innocent, or Of exalted rank; as
the devotion manifested by such persons through long service and arduous labors
entitles them to this privilege.
The same rule applies where anyone has retired from the office of decurion,
for, on account of his former, position, he must not be subjected to torture.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of
Theodore, 299.
18. The Emperor Justinian to Demosthenes, Prsetorian Prefect.
So far as the torture of slaves belonging to an estate is concerned, We order
that, in accordance with former laws and constitutions, no distinction shall be
made, whether a question has arisen among the heirs as to the title to the
entire estate, or only to a portion of the same, or to both; for the slaves can
only be interrogated concerning certain property of the estate, and those alone
shall be liable to torture who had charge of its administration, whether they
were left in servitude, or were directed to obtain their freedom by the last
will of the testator, so that any property belonging to the estate which may
have been concealed can be discovered. Before this is done, however, he who
demands the torture of the slaves must take the oath prescribed by Us in such
cases.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof October, at Chalcedon, during the
Consulate of Decius, 529.
TITLE XLII. CONCERNING ABOLITION^
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Paterna.
If the Governor of the province should ascertain that the abolition obtained by
the accused includes all the crimes with which he was
1 Abolitio,at Civil Law, in some respects, resembled the nolle prosequiof
modern times. It was the only means by which the progress of a criminal
proceeding could be arrested, and was granted upon application, either by the
court, the Senate, or the Emperor. The judge had power to dispose of a case in
this way, where the prosecutor was able to show good cause for retirement, or
any of the requisite legal formalities had not been observed. A general
abolitiowas equivalent to an amnesty, which, however, was not final, as the
accuser could renew the prosecution within thirty days, if he so desired.
Either the accuser or the defendant could apply for an abolitio,but the
acquiescence of the latter was essential in every instance.
This proceeding was not unknown to the early English law, as by Stat. 25, Hen.
Vill, c. 21, the king or the judges could authorize the accuser to abandon the
further prosecution of a criminal offence.ED.
charged, his authority will be interposed to prevent what has once been
terminated from being renewed. Although prosecution of the crime may have
ceased on account of the above-mentioned abolition, still the latter can be
revoked by the same person at whose request it was obtained.
Published on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of
Diocletian, Consul for the third time, and Maximian, 287.
2. The Emperor Constantine to Januarius, Prsetorian Prefect.
Abolition ought to be requested in the presence of both parties in a case where
a competent judge, and not the Emperor, has jurisdiction; that is to say, when
anyone admits that he brought the charge either through mistake, rashly, or in
the heat of anger, for an accuser who makes an explanation of this kind affords
good ground for abolition.
Where, however, the accuser, either through fraud, or having been corrupted by
the money of the defendant, requests the dismissal of the case, the voice of
purchased commiseration shall not be heard, but trial of the guilty party shall
proceed, and the proper penalty be imposed. Persons who protect themselves and
their families from injury, by accusing their own relatives, are by no means
prohibited from asking that the prosecutions which they have instituted be
abandoned.
Given on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of
Constantine, Consul for the fifth time, and Licinius, 319.
3. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Florus, Prsetorian
Prefect.
Permission to dismiss a criminal charge, which has been wrongfully brought by
the accusers, shall not be granted. If, however, anyone should inaugurate a
prosecution in good faith, and the defendant sustain some injury on account of
the written accusation, that is to say, if he should be imprisoned, or
subjected to torture or scourging, or placed in chains, abolition shall not be
granted, unless he who suffered the wrong consents for this to be done.
But when the defendant did not suffer anything of this kind, and was afterwards
delivered up to the officers of justice for safe custody, the accuser will be
permitted to apply for a dismissal of the case within thirty days, even against
the wishes of the defendant; but We decree that such permission shall not be
granted after this time, unless the defendant gives his consent. If any
freeborn persons, although of plebeian origin, who were not accomplices and
participants in the crime, should, for the purpose of obtaining evidence, have
been subjected to scourging and torture, We order that the judge shall refuse
to dismiss the case, even at the request of both parties, and that the trial,
in which torture was applied, shall proceed.
Even though it may not have been inflicted upon the witnesses, absolution shall
not be granted for certain crimes (such as in high treason, rebellion,
treachery, embezzlement, violation of oaths, and all the other offences
included in the ancient law) in which a judge should
require the accuser not only to prove what he alleges, but the defendant, who
denies the charge, to clear himself, if he can do so.
Given on the day before the Idesof October, during the Consulate of our Prince
Valentinian, and Victor, 369.
TITLE XLIII. CONCERNING GENERAL ABOLITION.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Rutilianus, Consular of Cilicia.
Anyone who, having the power to bring a criminal accusation, after a general
amnesty of all criminals has been proclaimed in the usual manner, neglects to
prosecute within the time specified by the Edict, shall not be heard.
Published on the eighth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Lsetus,
Consul for the second time, and Cerealis, 216.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Paulinus.
As the accusation was not brought by you at the time when Our indulgence
pardoned all crimes, the prescription based upon public amnesty does not apply.
Published on the sixth of the Idesof February, during the Consulate of Maximus,
Consul for the second time, and Aquilinus, 286.
3. The Emperors Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian to the Senate.
Conscript Fathers, pardon brands with infamy those whom it liberates, for it
does not remove the disgrace of the crime, but merely dispenses with the
punishment.
Given on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of Gratian,
Consul for the second time, and Probus, 371.
TITLE XLIV.
CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS SHOULD BE TERMINATED WITHIN A CERTAIN TIME.
1. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Desi-derius,
Vicegerent of Asia.
If any accuser should, in writing, denounce a defendant in court, and fail to
proceed with the accusation, which he began, within the time prescribed by law,
or should not appear upon the last day, which is an act of contumacy, he shall
be fined the fourth part of all his property, and shall undergo the legal
penalties, in addition to the infamy ordered by the ancient laws.
Given on the fourth of the Idesof July, during the Consulate of Arcadius and
Bauto, 385.
2. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Cecilianus, Prsetorian Prefect.
All judges, no matter what offices they hold, or over what tribunals they
preside, are notified that necessary delays must not be refused to
either of the parties in criminal cases (if they are requested), that is to
say, after a written information has been filed; but the trial should take
place within a certain time, and if this has elapsed, the accuser who failed to
prosecute the case shall suffer the punishment prescribed by the laws. If he is
a person of such inferior rank that he will sustain no damage by the loss of
his reputation, he shall be subjected to the penalty of exile, unless the case
is dismissed by the consent of both parties within the time established by law.
Moreover, the diligence of judges should be such that no good reason can arise
for either the defendant or the prosecutor to ask for delay, and they should
press the hearing of cases of this kind without expecting a continuance.
Given at Ravenna, on the twelfth of the Kalendsof February, during the
Consulate of Honorius, Consul for the eighth time, and Theodosius, Consul for
the third time, 409.
3. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Prsetorian Prefect.
We decree that criminal cases shall, by all means, be terminated within two
years from the time when issue was joined, nor shall this period be extended
under any pretext; but, after the two years have elapsed, the case shall not
proceed further but the accused shall be discharged. Judges and their
subordinate officials are hereby notified that if, at the request of litigants,
they should delay the examination or trial of a case beyond the time aforesaid,
they must pay a fine of twenty pounds of gold.
Given on the Kalendsof April ....
TITLE XLV.
ON THE TURPILLIAN DECREE OF THE SENATE.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Amatus.
He is held to be liable to the penalty imposed by the Decree of the Senate who,
after having denounced a public crime, and begun the prosecution of the same,
that is to say, filed a written accusation, furnished a surety, and, caused the
arrest of the accused and his delivery into custody, abandons the case without
having previously caused it to be dismissed.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Apius.
If you became surety for someone who had brought a criminal accusation in
writing, and afterwards desisted from the prosecution, and you bound yourself
by a stipulation, you will not be liable for any sum above that specified in
the contract. He, however, who failed to prosecute shall be branded with
infamy, and severely punished by the judicial authorities.
3. The Emperors Valerian and Gattienus to Syllanus.Although the written
instrument in question contained the provision that abolition of the crime
should first be demanded, and that
afterwards the accused would comply with everything mentioned therein, and your
adversary failed to keep the promises which he made to you, you cannot renew
the accusation from which you yourself desisted.
Published on the day before the Nonesof July, during the Consulate of Tuscus
and Bassus, 259.
4. The Same Emperors to Patrophilus.
If the person against whom you petition has renewed an accusation against your
parents, which you allege he had abandoned, an exception on this ground can be
pleaded against him in the tribunal of the governor.
Published on the day before the Nonesof May, during the Consulate of Secularus
and Donatus, 261.
5. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Matrona.
When a woman prosecutes anyone for an injury committed against her or her
relatives, and afterwards acknowledges that she desisted under an agreement
contrary to the ancient laws, it is a positive rule of law that she has
incurred the penalty imposed by the Turpillian Decree of the Senate.
Given on the seventh of the Nonesof April, during the Consulate of the Caesars.
6. The Same Emperors to Lucilius.
In criminal prosecutions, those are considered to have desisted who have
abandoned the case without the intention of renewing the accusation. Therefore,
as your petition states that your ignorance was one of the reasons why you did
not prosecute the case to the end, you can, without any apprehension of
hindrance on account of the short interruption which took place, proceed with
the accusation according to law and bring it to a termination, after having
proved what is required of you.
Published on the third of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of
Diocletian, Consul for the sixth time, and Maximian, 296.
TITLE XXLLVVII..CONCERNING CALUMNIATORS.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Sabinus.
An accusation of calumny should be prosecuted from the time the charge was
heard in the presence of the accuser, and therefore, the case having been
decided, it is contrary to the ordinary practice for you to demand that your
accuser be punished for calumny.
2. The Same Emperor to Apollonia.
A mother is included among those persons who, without the fear of calumny, can
avenge the death of her son, and the benefit of the Decree of the Senate is
also granted her in other prosecutions.
A foreign heir, who prosecutes anyone on account of suspicions entertained by
the deceased with reference to his death, is released from liability for
calumny on this account, as a great difference exists between a voluntary
accusation and that required of the heir on account of his position.
Published on the sixth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Julian
and Crispus, 226.
3. The Same Emperor to ^milius.
When anyone who is unable to prove the accusation of crime which he brought is
not convicted of calumny, he will sustain no loss of reputation ; for if the
defendant should be acquitted, the accuser ought not to be considered a
calumniator merely on that account, if he had good reason for bringing the
charge.
4. The Emperors Cams, Carinus, and Numerianus to Arcadius.
The penalty of calumny cannot be inflicted on account of an accusation brought
to avenge the death of a father.
Published on the eleventh of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of
Carus and Carinus, 283.
5. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Cassius.
Persons can only be convicted of calumny who prosecute criminal cases, and not
those who institute legal proceedings involving freedom, and which also include
private matters that are the subject of controversy.
6. The Same Emperors to Domitius.
The penalty of double damages is provided by the Julian Law in favor of the
owners of slaves, where the latter have been subjected to torture by the false
denunciation of an accuser.
Ordered on the fifteenth ....
7. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Valerius.
Your Excellency should not order anyone to be brought before your tribunal for
examination unless the accuser has previously complied with all the legal
formalities required; as, according to the provisions of the ancient laws, when
an accusation is brought, the defendant shall be punished if it is proved; and
where the accuser fails to establish the charge, he himself must suffer the
penalty.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of Gratian
and Gadalaifus.
8. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Menan-drius, Vicegerent
of Asia.
It is stated both in Our Constitutions and in those of Our predecessors that
persons who bring accusations in the names of others shall be classed as
informers. Hence if the accusation is known to be false, the penalty of infamy
will be imposed upon him whose charge was
not proved in court; wherefore, all persons are notified that they will not be
permitted to bring to the attention of judges criminal accusations which cannot
be established.
Given at Constantinople, on the eighth of the Idesof May, during the Consulate
of Arcadius and Bauto, 385.
9. The Same Emperors to Florus, Prsetorian Prefect.
No legal pretext advanced by way of excuse will be of any advantage to a man
who brings a false accusation, especially after the defendant has been produced
in court, nor will any public or private abolition profit, or be of any
advantage to such a person, nor will any special indulgence or general
privilege release him from liability.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof June, during the
Consulate of Antonius and Syagrius, 382.
10. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to the Praetors, the Tribunes of the
People, and the Senate, Greeting:
Anyone who brings a criminal accusation is informed that if it should prove to
be false he will not go unpunished, as those who are guilty of calumny will be
liable to the same penalty as the accused persons, had they been convicted.1
Given on the eighth of the Idesof August, during the Consulate of the above-
mentioned Emperors.
TITLE XLVII. CONCERNING PUNISHMENTS.
1. The Emperor Titus JElius Antoninus to Lucius.
The condition of persons condemned to hard labor for life is not different from
that of those who have been sentenced to deportation to an island.
Without date or designation of Consulate.
2. The Emperor Antoninus to Valerius.
My Attorney, who was not acting as Governor, could not inflict upon you the
penalty of exile, and therefore you need have no apprehension of his sentence,
as it was not in conformity to law.
3. The Same Emperor to the Senate.
It is clear that a decurion cannot be sentenced to labor on the public works.
1 Calumnia,as referred to above in the text, means malicious criminal
prosecution, whose employment, together with promoting vexatious or groundless
lawsuits, or demanding money for not doing so, constituted one of the most
common and detested offences enumerated in Roman jurisprudence. All
participants in it, whether directly or indirectly implicated, were liable to
the penalty, which, in addition to the damages recoverable by an action,
entailed the opprobrium of infamy.ED.
4. The Same Emperor to Marina.
If the child mentioned by you in your application was conceived before his
mother was sentenced to the mines, his condition after his birth will be that
of his mother before her conviction.
5. The Same Emperor to the Senate.
It is one of the privileges of veterans that their children, as far as the
first degree, cannot be sentenced to the mines or the public works, but must be
relegated to an island.
6. The Same Emperor to Alphius.
Your statement that a freeman has been condemned to imprisonment in chains for
life is incredible, for this penalty can scarcely be imposed upon a person of
servile condition.
Published on the third of the Idesof February, during the Consulate of Messala
and Sabinus, 215.
7. The Emperor Alexander to Isidore.
Immunity for the commission of crime is not conceded on account of age, when
anyone is capable of perpetrating the crime of which he is accused.
8. The Same Emperor to Victor.
The property of persons who have been deported to an island by a judge having
proper jurisdiction shall be confiscated to the Treasury, but that of those who
have been relegated shall not be confiscated, unless this is expressly included
in the sentence.
9. The Same Emperor to Demetrius.
If it should be proved that your mother was the daughter of a decurion, it is
apparent that she cannot be condemned to work for persons employed in the
mines, or to the mines themselves.
10. The Same Emperor to Catullus.
Where a slave has been sentenced by the Governor of a province to the penalty
of confinement in chains, without prescribing any time when he shall be
returned to his master, he should be kept in chains for life.
11. The Emperor Gordian to Titian.
The punishment of performing menial services for persons employed in the mines
can be inflicted upon free men and women, as well as upon those in a servile
condition.
12. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian Stated in the Consistory :
"The sons of decurions should not be thrown to wild beasts." When, on hearing
this, the people cried out, the Emperors added: "No attention should be paid to
the vain remonstrances of the popu-
lace; for they should not be believed, either when they desire a criminal to be
pardoned, or an innocent person to be condemned."
13. The Same Emperor to Ursinus.
After a slave has been convicted, if his master has not been deprived of his
ownership by the sentence, he has a right to demand his services.
14. The Same Emperors and Ctesars to Vicarius.
If the time designated in a sentence of labor oh the public works has not yet
expired, it is proper to wait until it has elapsed; as it is to the public
interest for a penalty not to be hastily remitted, lest someone may, for this
reason, rashly commit crime.
15. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Agathus.
It is not lawful to revoke the penalty imposed by a sentence of the Governor of
a province.
16. The Emperor Constantine to Catulinus, Proconsul of Africa.
Let the judge about to pass sentence exercise moderation, so that before
imposing a capital penalty upon anyone, as in the case of adultery, homicide,
or witchcraft, the accused may be convicted either by his own confession, or by
the positive statements of persons subjected to torture, or interrogated; so
that there may be a general agreement of the testimony with reference to his
guilt, and he may be implicated to such an extent that it will scarcely be
necessary for him who committed the crime to deny it.
Given on the third of the Nonesof November, during the Consulate of Volusianus
and Annianus, 314.
17. The Same Emperor to Eumelius.
Where anyone has been condemned to the mines for a criminal offence, he shall
not be branded upon the face, as this part of his sentence can be impressed
upon his hand, or the calf of his leg by a single mark; and his face, which has
been formed in the image of celestial beauty, shall not suffer disfigurement.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof April, during the fourth Consulate of
Constantine and Licinius, 315.
18. The Emperor Constantius to Theodore, Governor of Arabia.
As a certain time was granted the defendants, who were convicted by clear
evidence, before sentence was passed, the right of petitioning the Emperor as
well as the opportunity of evading the penalties incurred by their criminal
acts was afforded them; and, as in the crime of homicide and other serious
offences punishment should not be deferred, the laws having reference to crime
must hereafter be observed, and convicted criminals and malefactors be
sentenced without delay.
Given on the Idesof October, during the Consulate of Constantius. Consul for
the fourth time, and Constans, 343.
19. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Olybrius, Prefect of the City.
Let no one, by way of punishment for crime, be transferred from one guild to
another, if he is a member of any, but every culprit shall experience the
severity of the law prescribed for the crime of which he was convicted.
Given on the third of the Idesof April, during the Consulate of Valentinian,
365.
20. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Flavian, Prsetorian
Prefect of Illyria and Italy.
If, having in view the circumstances of the case, We, contrary to Our custom,
should order any persons to be punished with exemplary severity, We are not
willing for the guilty parties to suffer the penalty immediately, or the
sentence to be executed without delay; but desire that their fate and fortune
shall remain in suspense for the term of thirty days.
The defendants, however, must be placed in safe custody, and vigilantly guarded
during the time aforesaid.
Given at Verona, on the fifth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate
of Antonius and Syagrius, 382.
21. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Prin-cipius,
Prsetorian Prefect.
In order that the depraved and venal perfidy of court attendants may not
hereafter be exercised with impunity contrary to the public welfare,'We decree
that legal penalties can be pronounced against them even during their absence.
Given on the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of Arcadius and Bauto, 385.
22. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Eutychianus, Prsetorian Prefect.
We order that punishment shall be inflicted only upon those who are liable to
it, and We exclude all relatives, acquaintances, and companions from the
imputation of calumny, as association with criminals does not necessarily
render them guilty, and neither affinity nor friendship presumes implication in
crime. Therefore, let each one be responsible for the offences which he himself
commits, and let the fear of punishment go no further than the detection of
guilt.
This law shall be communicated to all judges.
Given at Constantinople, on the eighth of the Kalendsof August, during the
Consulate of Eutropius and Theodore, 399.
23. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Anthemius, Pr&-torian Prefect.
We decree that all those whom the terms of their sentences have condemned to
exile, and who have served the designated time in prison, shall at once be
liberated from custody, and released from their
chains, as they have paid the penalty, and need not apprehend the wretchedness
of exile. It will be sufficient for them to have undergone such severe
punishment, nor shall those who have been long deprived of the common blessings
of air and light, and for an extended period have been oppressed with heavy
chains, be compelled to suffer the penalty of exile in addition.
Given on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of
Constantius and Constans, 414.
24. The Same Emperors to Monachius, Prastorian Prefect.
We order all Governors of provinces to see that persons who have been condemned
to undergo the penalty of exile for a certain time, shall, as soon as that time
has expired, be no longer confined in prison, or kept under restraint in the
places to which they were exiled.
Given at Eudoxiopolis, on the third of the Kalendsof September, during the
Consulate of Our Lord the Emperor Theodosius, Consul for the seventh time, and
Balladius, 416.
25. The Same Emperors to Monaxius, Praetorian Prefect.
We decree that those who instruct barbarians how to build ships, when the
latter were previously ignorant of the art, shall be put to death.
Given at Constantinople, on the eighth of the Kalendsof October, during the
Consulate of Monaxius and Pinta, 419.
TITLE XLVIII.
CERTAIN JUDGES SHALL NOT BE PERMITTED TO CONFISCATE PROPERTY WITHOUT THE ORDER
OF THE EMPEROR.
1. The Emperor Theodosius and the Csesar Valentinian to Hierius, Prsetorian
Prefect.
No judge (with the exception of those of the highest rank) shall be permitted,
during times of prescription, to confiscate the entire property of anyone,
unless he has first made application to Us to do so.
Given at Constantinople, on the tenth of the Kalendsof February, during the
Consulate of Theodosius, Consul for the eleventh time, and the Caesar
Valentinian, 425.
TITLE XLIX.
CONCERNING THE PROPERTY OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN PROSCRIBED OR CONDEMNED.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Marcus.
It is well known that masters are not deprived of the peculiumof any of their
slaves who have been convicted of a capital crime, but a master shall receive
whatever he can prove belonged to his slave, and the price of the property, if
any has been sold by him; and power
is also granted to suspend sentence until the accounts of his administration
have been rendered by the slave, and the disposition of the property explained.
The master should, however, remember that this must be done quickly in order
that the slave may be delivered up to punishment.
2. The Emperor Alexander to Pronto.
Persons sentenced to deportation do not transmit to their heirs any property
which they may have acquired after their conviction; but this, as well as what
they previously possessed, shall be confiscated.
3. The Same Emperor to Julianus.
If your son, while under your control, was sentenced to deportation to an
island, you will not be deprived of his peculium,which he obtained in military
service, or which you gave him while in the army.
Published on the sixth of the Idesof September, during the Consulate of
Alexander, Consul for the second time, and Marcellus, 227.
4. The Emperor Gordian to Callimorphus.
Anyone who is condemned to the mines becomes a penal slave, hence the property
of him upon whom a sentence of this kind has been imposed is confiscated to the
Treasury. Therefore, if you allege that he who was afterwards pardoned by Us
had any property, it will belong to the Treasury rather than to him who was
sentenced.
5. The Emperor Philip to Arrian.
If (as you allege) the property of him who administered your guardianship and
was sentenced has been confiscated to the Treasury, apply to Our Attorney who,
if he ascertains that you are legally entitled to anything, will not refuse it.
6. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Gaudentius.It is a positive rule of
law that children are entitled to none of the property of their mother, who has
been condemned to deportation.
7. The Emperors Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian to Probus, Prsetorian Prefect.
If anyone in a province should incur the penalty of proscription, on account of
the nature of his crime, a complete inventory of his property must be carefully
made by the proper authority, to prevent anything from being abstracted through
favor of collusion; and a full description must be given of the extent and
character of the land, and what proportion of it is tilled, or unimproved, how
much of it is susceptible of cultivation, and how much in vineyards, olive
orchards, pasture, and timber.
There should also be included a statement of the advantages and beauty of the
property, as well as the decorations of the buildings, and how many slaves are
used in the cultivation of the land, whether
they are from the city or the country, and in what occupations they are
engaged. It should also be stated how many collectors there are, as well as the
number of tenants and oxen employed in the tillage of the soil; the number of
cattle and sheep, and the kinds of each; the quantity of gold, silver,
clothing, jewels; and whether the metal is coined, or in bulk; and the
designation of the various coins, as well as the amount of property deposited
in storehouses. After everything that you perceive that We desire has been
entered in the inventory, it should be delivered to the Steward of Our Private
Affairs, or to the officials of the palace appointed for this purpose, in order
that it may become part of the property of the Crown.
Moreover, an account of everything specified and separately enumerated should
be sent to Us, under seal of the judge, and there is no doubt that if he should
be guilty of negligence in this respect he must be fined. If, after the
examination made by the aforesaid official and reported to the Steward of Our
Private Affairs, to whom the inventory should be sent, it should be found that
something had been fraudulently omitted from the list, the said official shall
be punished by being compelled to pay the amount which has been fraudulently
suppressed, out of his own property.
Given on the third of the Nonesof May, during the Consulate of the Noble Prince
Valentinian and Victor, 369.
8. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Eutro-pius, Praetorian
Prefect.
When a person sentenced to deportation has sons, some of whom are emancipated
and some are not, the portion of his estate to which his children are entitled
shall be transferred only to those under his control, if those who have been
emancipated think that, by relinquishing what they obtained at the time when
this occurred, they will sustain loss. If, however, they should prefer that a
merger of property and donations should take place, everything which the
Treasury grants to the children of a condemned criminal shall be equally
divided among them.
This rule shall also be observed with reference to the dowry of a daughter, or
a granddaughter by the son of a person condemned to deportation.
Given at Thessalonica, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof July, during the
Consulate of Gratian, Consul for the fifth time, and Theodosius, 380.
9. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Csesarius, Prastorian Prefect.
When anyone is sentenced to deportation, his wife can claim her own property,
no matter how she may have acquired it, and even if it has already been seized,
or taken possession of in any way, she will be entitled to receive it at once.
Her dowry, also, if it can be proved that she actually gave it to her husband
(but not what is sometimes inserted without effect in dotal instruments) shall
be delivered to her.
Again, anything which she received by way of donation from her husband before
marriage, or which came into her hands during marriage, through the generosity
of her husband, before his conviction, will undoubtedly belong to her.
(1) Moreover, if it should appear clearly that any property had been given by a
father to his emancipated children, before the commission of the crime and his
conviction, it shall be reserved for them unimpaired, and without controversy.
Anything, however, which neither the wife nor the emancipated children can
legally claim, I decree shall be seized by the public authorities, and
confiscated, and a report made to Me stating whether the condemned person has
any children; and it should also be added whether they claimed anything for
themselves on the ground of a donation.
(2) With regard to those who are indebted to the Treasury, and have been
proscribed and condemned on this account, it has been decided that where the
wife has any property of her own, or any which was given to her by her husband
before he committed the act on account of which the prosecution for fraud was
instituted, and if anything was afterwards donated to his emancipated sons,
before the perpetration of the crime, it shall remain intact in the hands of
those who received it; and no one shall, under any circumstances, be held
liable to the Treasury, except for what the convicted criminal himself owned
when he contracted the obligation to the Treasury, or what he purchased in his
own name, or in that of his wife, his children, or anyone else.1
-1In the early days of Roman jurisprudence, confiscation of personal property
always followed a sentence of death or exile. This was subsequently extended to
all convictions of crime punishable with penal servitude for life.
The provisions of the ancient English law, which subjected a convicted traitor
to the forfeiture of his property, both real and personal, and anyone convicted
of felony to the confiscation of his goods and chattels, have been rescinded in
recent times. A marked distinction existed between the forfeiture of real
estate and that of chattels, for land was forfeited to the Crown upon
attainder, but the loss of personal effects was a necessary incident of
conviction without it. (VideStephen, Commentaries of the Laws of England I, VI,
XX.)
By the Forfeiture Act of 1870 (33 & 34 Vie., C. 23) guilt of treason or felony
was declared to no longer entail confiscation; and this penalty, which for many
centuries had been a source of grievous oppression to the unfortunate families
of convicted malefactors, was abolished.
The confiscation of the enemy's property by a hostile government, while
generally recognized, is subject to many modifications; and a distinction is
made between what belongs to the State and what is owned by individuals. The
title to chattels vests upon occupation, but that of land only after absolute
conquest. (VideBaker, First Steps in International Law, Chap. XXI, Pages 226,
227, 228.)
This principle has a much more extended application in the United States, where
the Supreme Court has held: "That war gave to the sovereign full right to take
the persons and confiscate the property of the enemy wherever found; and that
the mitigations of this rigid rule which the wise and humane policy of modern
times had introduced into practice, might, more or less, affect the exercise of
the right, but could not impair the right itself." (Brown vs. The United
States, 8
Cranch, 110.)
This doctrine does not apply where treaty provisions exist to the contrary,
contingent, of course, upon the proper behavior of the alien enemies whose
property otherwise would be subject to seizure and appropriation by the
State.ED.
Those, however, are only excepted who have performed the duties of Caesarians
or Catholici, who are excluded from every privilege until their accounts have
been approved and accepted by Me, and they shall then have the right to
transmit any of their property which is clear of encumbrance.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Nonesof August, during the
Consulate of Arcadius, Consul for the fourth time, and Honorius, Consul for the
third time, 396.
10. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Hierius, Prse-torian Prefect.
When anyone is convicted of a crime and sentenced to death or deportation, his
property shall be confiscated to the Treasury, if he dies without issue. When,
however, he is survived by sons or daughters, or grandchildren by his sons,
after half of his estate has been confiscated to the Treasury, the remainder
shall be reserved for them.
The same rule applies if he should leave posthumous children. If he who
incurred this penalty was a decurion, and had no children, his curiashall
succeed to him, and will be entitled to his entire estate, and can itself
either hold it or transfer it to another, who shall discharge the official
duties of the deceased at his own risk.
If, however, the decurion had sons, even though they were not yet born, they
will be entitled to the entire estate of their father. If there are any
daughters, they will have a right to half of the estate, and the curiato the
other half. When there are both sons and daughters, half of the estate shall be
given to the sons, in the name of the curia,and the other half, which the
indulgence of the Emperor has assigned to all in common, shall be divided
equally among the children, except in cases of high treason, for, under such
circumstances, anyone who was guilty of such an atrocious crime shall justly
transmit his penalty to his posterity.
Given at Constantinople, on the tenth of the Kalendsof February, during the
Consulate of Our Lord Theodosius, Consul for the twelfth time, and Valentinian,
Consul for the second time, 426.
Extract from Novel 134, Last Chapter. Latin Text.
The property of those who have been condemned or proscribed is not confiscated
for the benefit of the judges or their officers, nor, in accordance with the
ancient laws, for the benefit of the Treasury; but should be given to the
ascendants and descendants of the person convicted, or to his collateral heirs,
as far as the third degree, if there are any.
Moreover, their wives are entitled to their dowries and antenuptial donations.
Where, however, they were married without any dowry, they will receive from the
estates of their husbands the portion designated by law, whether they have any
children or not. When the condemned persons leave none of the heirs above
mentioned, their property shall be confiscated to the Treasury. We order that
the ancient laws shall be observed with reference to persons convicted of the
crime of treason.
TITLE L.
CONCERNING THE PROPERTY OF THOSE WHO COMMIT
SUICIDE.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Aquilia.
The property of those who, having ascertained that their crime has been
discovered, through fear of a future sentence, lay violent hands upon
themselves, shall be confiscated to the Treasury. Therefore, if if should be
proved that your brother or your father, having committed no offence, but on
account of corporeal suffering, weariness of life, a sudden attack of rage or
insanity, or for any other reason, put an end to his life, his property shall
belong to his heirs, whether he left a will, or died intestate.
2. The Emperor Alexander to Rusticus.
The estates of those who, after having been accused of crime, commit suicideif
the accusation is not for treason, and they did not kill themselves through
fear of its resultsare transmitted to their heirs.


TITLE LI.
CONCERNING THOSE WHO HAVE SERVED THEIR SENTENCES AND BEEN PARDONED.
1. The Emperor Antoninus.
When the Emperor, having bidden farewell to the illustrious Przetorian Prefects
Gentian, Adventus, and Opilius-Macrinus, and to his friends and principal
officers both civil and military, was about to depart, Julianus Licinianus, who
had been sentenced to deportation to an island, was presented to him by
Opilius-Ulpianus, at that time Lieutenant of the Emperor, and Antoninus
Augustus said to him: "I restore you to your province with all your rights,"
and added, "Moreover, that you may know what it means to be restored to all
your rights, I hereby reinstate you in your offices, your rank, and all your
other privileges."
2. The Same Emperor to Quietus.
If, as you allege, your father has been sentenced to the mines, it is only
right that his property should be confiscated to the Treasury; and if, through
My clemency he has been released only from the penalty, he did not, for this
reason, obtain the restitution of his property, unless this favor was
especially granted him.
3. The Emperor Alexander to Stratonicus.
If the debtor underwent the penalty to which he was sentenced, and his property
was taken from him, even though he afterwards recovered his Roman citizenship,
he did not obtain his entire property, but only a portion of the same through
the favor of the Emperor; and
he is released from the obligation of the payment of the entire indebtedness
contracted before his conviction, but will only be liable in proportion to the
amount which he recovered. If, however, his property was confiscated to the
Treasury, on account of the money which he owed it, he and his sureties will
remain liable to his creditors for his debts.
4. The Same Emperor to Valentina.
The guardian of your children, prsetorian possession of whose estates you say
that you have received, having been condemned to the mines, and afterwards
having returned under a general amnesty, although he has. become more wealthy,
will not be liable to you in an action for the administration of guardianship;
unless by the terms of his pardon he was expressly restored to his former
condition, and the possession of all his property.
5. The Same Emperor to Julianus.
Although, after having been deported to an island and your property
confiscated, you may have returned under the general amnesty, still, any rights
of action to which you are entitled belong to the Treasury; and hence your
demand that actions may be granted in your favor against the heirs of your
guardian is contrary to law.
6. The Emperor Gordian to Fabianus, Prsetorian Prefect.
As your son has been deported to an island, he was, for this reason, released
from paternal control; and if (as you allege) he afterwards returned to his
country and was restored to his former rank through the clemency of the Divine
Alexander, paternal authority is not considered to have been re-established
over him.
7. The Emperor Philip to Cassius.
Our general amnesty permitted all exiled or deported persons to return, but did
not restore to them the offices of which they were deprived, nor did they
recover their reputations intact and unimpaired.
8. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus to Seleucius.
You are mistaken if you think that you still have any rights over your slave,
who was condemned to the mines, and afterwards pardoned, for it has not been
decided that by an act of indulgence of this kind the former ownership of a
master is restored. The Governor of the province, however, will see that you do
not suffer any injury from the slave; and if he has any of your property in his
possession, the Attorney of the Crown will decide the dispute between you, for
the slave belongs to the Treasury.
9. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Restitutus.
If your father, after having been deported to an island, was restored to his
country by a general amnesty, and did not expressly obtain the privilege of
having his children again placed under his con-
trol, there is no doubt that the estate obtained by you is not acquired for his
benefit, as the sentence passed upon him rendered you the head of the family.
10. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Demetrius.
As you return to your home by virtue of Our clemency, you need not apprehend
that you will be subjected to prosecution by the Governor of the province,
whose annotation has already been annulled.
11. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Philip.
The fact that he who brought an action with reference to a tract of land was
through Our benevolence restored to his country and the possession of his
property, after having been sentenced to deportation, does not alter the former
condition of the case.

12. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Trypho, Prsetorian Prefect.
Where a person condemned to deportation was pardoned by Us, and recovered his
property, he cannot protect himself against his creditors, and avoid paying his
legal debts under the pretext of having paid the penalty of his crime.

13. The Emperor Constantine to Maximus, Prefect of the City.
With reference to the will which the son of a man who was deported made during
the lifetime of his father, We, rejecting the opinions of Ulpianus and Paulus,
have adopted that of Papinianus, namely, that the son is again placed under the
control of his father, to whom his rank and property have been restored.
(1) Nevertheless, any transactions entered into by the son shall be considered
valid, if he had reached lawful age; and, after he has been restored to
paternal authority, they should not be rescinded, as it would be absurd for
anyone at the same time to be neither under the control of his father, nor his
own master.
(2) Minors are forbidden by law to transact any business. If, after the
condemnation of their father, a guardian should be appointed for them, he must
relinquish his office as soon as the former returns, as he should not only
nominally return, but must also discharge his paternal duty, and see that his
children are not corrupted, and that their property is cared for and increased.
For if he abuses his authority to the extent of destroying or wasting the
property of his children, the latter should be treated in the same manner as
insane or demented persons, or spendthrifts, or those given to all lusts and
vices, to whom money ought not to be entrusted; and such a father should be
removed from the administration, and not only cease to be guardian, but must,
out of his own property, indemnify the minor for any useless expense or loss
which he has sustained. Moreover, the sentence of deportation cannot be
advanced to the prejudice of the father.
(3) If, after his return, the integrity of the father should be found to be
unimpaired, so that he ought to be restored to his natural
position, and the discharge of his duty to his offspring, the management of
their property should be transferred to him whose care resembles that
established by the public law. And unless this is done where fathers are good,
their return will be more doleful than their departure, so far as the children
are concerned.
(4) Therefore a pardon is beneficial for the purpose of restitution only to the
extent that the sentence was beneficial for correction, so that, if the loss of
all his property resulted from deportation, by means of pardon his possessions,
his rank, and everything of which he was deprived, including his good name,
will be regained. Hence sons request emancipation from their fathers in order
that they may obtain freedom, not because of a judicial sentence, but as an
evidence of paternal affection.
Given at Sirmium, on the eighteenth of the Kalendsof October, during the second
Consulate of the Caesars, Crispus and Constantine, 321.





THE CODE OF OUR LORD THE MOST HOLY EMPEROR JUSTINIAN.
SECOND EDITION. BBOOOOKK XX..
TITLE I. CONCERNING THE RIGHTS OF THE TREASURY.


1. The Emperor Alexander to Atticus and Severus.
If your father is proved to have made a legal donation of the land in question,
before he became indebted to the Treasury, the transaction will not be
rescinded, as it was not entered into for the purpose of defrauding creditors.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Serenius.
A computation made by accountants does not obtain the force of a legal
decision, unless it has been confirmed by the Attorney of the Treasury.
3. The Same Emperor to Attica.
If the property hypothecated to the Treasury was through manifest fraud or
favor sold to the purchaser for less than its value, the Attorney of the
Treasury, having been applied to, will order the land to be returned, after you
have tendered the payment of the amount which is due.
4. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Nicetus.
A positive rule has been formulated with reference to metroicians who have been
transferred to another city by order of the Emperor. For if the lands which
they possessed before they were compelled to move have not been sold, it was
long since decreed that they shall be forfeited to the Treasury, unless the
Emperor, by a special decree, has provided otherwise. As this salutary
regulation has been established by former emperors, with this exception, no law
has been passed preventing them from becoming the heirs of their parents.
5. Extract from the Imperial Epistles of the Same Emperors to Flaccus.
It has been forbidden to seize without Imperial authority the property of
anyone who is thought to be indebted to the Treasury. And that every precaution
may be taken to prevent Caesarians 1from doing so, We order that all the
parties in interest shall be permitted to resist by force those who attempt
without Our permission, to seize the property of anyone who has become subject
to penalty of the law, so that even if officers should venture to violate the
terms of the present decree, they can be prevented from committing injustice by
the resistance of private persons. For he whose interest it is that the
property of anyone should not be interfered with, when officers appear to seize
it, ought to acquiesce, provided they produce their authority, as he will
ascertain from Our letters, and not from the arbitrary acts of the Csesarians
(that is to say, the officers) whether they have the right to take the
property, and that the law has empowered this to be done.
6. The Emperor Constantine to the Inhabitants of the Provinces.
We order that all documents through which the Treasury acquires legal rights of
action shall be burned, if they have not been made use of during the time
prescribed by law; so that no unjust suits may be brought by private persons,
and the example which We have ordered to be given by disposing of legal causes
of action belonging to the Treasury in this manner may be followed.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of Constantine,
Consul for the fifth time, and the Caesar Licinius, 319.
7. The Same Emperor to Volusianus, Prefect of the City.
The right of defence is granted to those whose property can be interfered with
in any way by the Treasury, as it is not right that it should be occupied or
seized while an action is still pending. Therefore, when a controversy arises
through the Treasury claiming the property of anyone, the party in possession
of the same shall have power to avail himself of all suitable defences; and if
the result should
1 Csesaria-ns were executive officers charged with the collection of claims
belonging to the Imperial Treasury; Catholici were the Receivers-General oi a
district.ED.
establish the fact that the property should be confiscated, then it shall be
lawful for it to be seized, and an inquiry made to ascertain the amount of it,
which must be done by conditional slaves, so that if anything has been
abstracted, it may be recovered, and as much more be exacted by the imposition
of a fine as was fraudulently removed.
If, however, an official should be implicated in an offence of this kind, he
should not enjoy the benefit of the right of seizure granted by this law;
especially if the practice of fraud has-caused any of the officials aforesaid,
who are accustomed to rashly indulge in such practices, to be excluded.
8. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Dracontius, Vicegerent of Africa.
Those persons who, by means of fraudulent contracts, entered into for the
purpose of injuring the Treasury, have implicated themselves in criminal acts,
shall be required to refund fourfold the amount obtained.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of
Valentinian and Valens, 365.
9. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Patricius, Count of Private Affairs.
We order that the decision of Your Highness concerning the responsibility of
the Stewards of the Imperial household for the appointment of collectors of Our
revenues shall be confirmed, so that all intriguing for office shall cease, and
that all the provisions enacted with a view to the maintenance or expenses of
the Imperial household which have been established and confirmed by ancient
custom, shall remain inviolate; and that the ancient practice relative to the
Irenarch and the Optio shall continue to be observed.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Theodosius, Consul for the ninth time, and Constantius, Consul for the second
time, 420.
10. The Same Emperors to Palladius, Praetorian Prefect of the East.
We decree that the estates of deceased persons who, during their lifetime, are
said to have been guilty of various crimes, shall, under no circumstances, be
confiscated to the Treasury, unless it should be established that they were
convicted of said crimes after having been publicly accused.
Given at Ravenna, on the eighth of the Idesof July, during the Consulate of
Eustachius and Agricola, 421.
11. This Law is not Authentic.
TITLE II.
CONCERNING SUITS BROUGHT AGAINST DEBTORS OF THE
TREASURY.
1. The Emperor Gordian to Saturninus and Others.
You are not unreasonable when you request that where the Treasury has a claim
against yourself and others, those debtors should be sued first who are
responsible for the balance due, and that recourse should afterwards be had to
you, who purchased certain property from them.
2. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus, and the Cazsar Valerian, to Erophilus.
The Treasury still has a right of action against you, even if it was stated in
the accounts that you paid the money due, if the registrar did not note the
receipt given to you for the same. It is, however, only just that power should
be given to sue the collector in order that the amount may be obtained from his
own property, if he is solvent, and the Treasury be indemnified, and afterwards
recourse can be had to you, if he should be unable to make payment.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian and the Cassars to Januarius and
Others.
As you allege that you are colleagues and associates of Augeriua and his son in
the collection of unpaid balances of taxes, and that they alone are charged
with the collection of other claims, and that the responsibility rests
principally upon them, and not upon them jointly with the others who were also
appointed collectors, and as you assert that since the persons being separate,
the responsibility should be divided, it is not contrary to law for the
Treasury to be indemnified out of the property of those who were first
designated to collect the unpaid taxes, and that afterwards those who appointed
them should be sued, if the entire indebtedness is not discharged.
Therefore, Our Receiver-General must observe the provisions of the law, that is
to say, he must first exhaust the property of the collectors, as well as of
those responsible for their appointment, and, if the Treasury should not obtain
enough for the payment of the entire indebtedness, it can also compel you to
pay whatever may still be due to it.
4. The Emperors Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian to Archelaus, Count of the
East.
Persons who are indebted to the Treasury shall, by all means, be held liable,
and be compelled to pay out of their individual property the debts which they
have contracted in their own names; and when they have done so, they will have
a right to collect from their debtors any valid claims which they may have
against them, in order that they may know that they can legally proceed against
those whom they assert are indebted to them.
Given on the third of the Nonesof July, during the Consulate of Our Prince
Valentinian, and Victor, 369.
5. The Same Emperors to Fortunatianus, Count of Private Affairs.
A memorandum which contained the names of debtors, or persons who have entered
into contracts with him, is said to have been found among the papers of a
person whose property was confiscated, but there was no proof either by
witnesses, or by any written evidence of indebtedness that the money had been
lent, as was stated in the memorandum; hence, We think that it would be unjust
for anyone to render another his debtor merely by a statement written by his
own hand. Therefore We desire by the present law to prevent the prosecution of
fraudulent claims by such means, so that the memorandum having been rejected as
without foundation, no one of those whose names were mentioned therein may be
compelled to make payment.
We order that this rule shall be observed in all similar cases.
Given at Hierapolis, on the day before the Nones ofJuly, during the Consulate
of Gratian, Consul for the fourth time, and Nerobaudus, 327.
TITLE III.
CONCERNING THE AUTHORITY OP AND THE RIGHTS CONFERRED BY SALES MADE AT AUCTION
BY THE TREASURY, AND CONCERNING BIDS.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Curtia.
State to My Attorney what you have set forth in your application, as your
request comes under his jurisdiction; and if you can prove to him that the sale
was not authorized by an agent, or by someone who had the right to do so, and
that the property was not sold at auction, nor disposed of in accordance with
the formalities required by law, if you pay what you owe under the judgment,
the sale which was contracted in bad faith must be rescinded, and you will
receive the property, together with the profits which fraudulently came into
the hands of the purchaser, or which it may be established ought to have come
into his hands.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Heracleo.
There are two reasons in favor of your claim: first, as you state your property
has been sold by public authority without having been offered at auction; and
second, because you allege that, through the Tow price paid on account of the
small amount of the debt, the sale was to the advantage of My Treasury and to
your loss; therefore, take steps to have these unlawful proceedings annulled as
much for the purpose of indemnifying the Treasury as to provide for your own
security.
3. The Same Emperors to Crispus.
If there are no written proofs of the sale in existence, and your wife can show
by any evidence that the house which you state she
bought from the Treasury in her own name is hers, and that she paid the price,
the ownership of the property transferred to her, My attorney will not permit
her to be annoyed by the Treasury, on the ground that the property belongs to
her mother.
4. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csssars, to Marcellina.
If the time prescribed by law with reference to sales made at auction by the
Treasury has not expired, as you state that you will pay more, apply to Our
Receiver, in order that he may accept your legal offer of a higher price.
5. The Emperors Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian to Viventius, Prsetorian
Prefect of the Gauls.
Property liable for unpaid taxes arising from the tribute of grain, or other
claims due to the Treasury, which should be sold at auction by the authority of
the latter, shall, no matter what the nature of the said property may be,
forever belong by the right of ownership to those to whom anything of this kind
has been regularly disposed of at public sale with the sanction of the
Treasury. And if a rescript should ever be obtained by anyone, for the purpose
of setting aside a sale of this kind made by the Treasury, it shall be null and
void; as where any of their property has been adjudged to purchasers on account
of fiscal indebtedness, even minors shall not have the power of recovering the
same at any age, by pleading their minority when the transaction
took place.
Given on the third of the Nonesof .November, during the Consulate of Our Noble
Prince Valentinian, and Victor, 369.
6. The Same Emperors to Felix, Count of the Sacred Largesses.
If anyone should buy property at a public sale made by the Treasury for the
payment of debts, he shall only be liable for the price of said property, which
it is apparent that he purchased at auction, after publication has been made,
for We protect such persons to the extent that We do not permit them to suffer
any loss, under the pretext that a balance due to the Treasury remains unpaid.
Given at Martianopolis, on the seventh of the Idesof March, during the
Consulate of Valentinian and Valens.
7. This Law is not Authentic.
TITLE IV.
CONCERNING THE SALE OF PROPERTY OWNED IN COMMON BY THE TREASURY AND PRIVATE
INDIVIDUALS.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Eupleus.
It is the rule that whenever property is held in common by the Treasury and
private persons, all of it shall be sold by My Attorney,
even though the smaller share belongs to the Treasury, but only the price of
the portion to which it is entitled shall be paid to the Treasury, and the
remainder shall be given to the joint-owner. Therefore, bring your action
against the purchaser of the lands mentioned in your petition, before the
proper judge, so that the former can set up the defences of which he has a
right to avail himself.
TITLE V. THE TREASURY CANNOT EVICT PROPERTY WHICH is SOLD.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Hermia.
Ideeply regret that the Treasury should call in question the payment that it
received, in consideration of which it transferred the property in good faith,
for it is only just that the purchaser should not be molested by having the
title disputed, or for any other reason; as in sales of this kind the officials
can settle their controversies without interfering with the purchaser.
2. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Palladius, Prse-torian Prefect.
The dictates of justice and honesty do not suffer the Treasury to rescind a
sale which it has once made.
TITLE VI.
CONCERNING THOSE WHO HAVE RECEIVED A LOAN OP MONEY PROM THE PUBLIC FUNDS.
1. The Emperors Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian to Probus, Prss-torian
Prefect.
If anyone should receive money as a loan bearing interest from collectors,
notaries, treasurers, or other officials, and is convicted, he shall, by the
authority of this law, be liable to the penalty of quadruple damages.
Given on the fourth of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Valentinian
and Valens, 365.
2. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Palladius, Pr&torian
Prefect.
All persons are hereby notified that no one is permitted to borrow money
belonging to the Imperial Treasury. Therefore, if anyone should, without Our
sanction, borrow money from Our Treasury for his private use, whether he does
so secretly, or after having furnished a bond or other security, for the
purpose of rendering himself a debtor, he shall be deprived of all his
property, and sentenced to perpetual deportation. He, also, who lends or gives
to anyone money out of the Treasury aforesaid, under the pretext of a public
loan, shall be condemned to death.
Given at Heraclia, on the twelfth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate
of Eucherius and Syagrius, 381.
TITLE VII.
'WHERE CREDITORS ARE REFERRED TO THE TREASURY WHEN PECUNIARY PENALTIES HAVE
BEEN PREFERRED.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Marcellus.
The collection of a penalty is postponed until other creditors have obtained
the settlement of their claims. Therefore, as, so far as the amount of the
claim is concerned, the Treasury has the preference, so the same rule should be
observed where triple damages are imposed by way of penalty, and added to the
original amount.
TITLE Vill. CONCERNING FISCAL INTEREST.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Antigonus.
Interest cannot be collected on the sum which you can prove has been imposed
upon you by way of penalty, for My Attorney will not demand any more than the
fine which has been imposed, but he will order you to pay the penalty.
2. The Emperor Alexander to Victorinus.
Where the claim was secured by a pledge, the Treasury, which took the place of
the debtor, will be required to pay interest, if it was inserted in the
original contract that this should be done.
3. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Prsstorian Prefect.
We order that the Treasury shall also obey the law which We have promulgated,
by which We permit creditors, with the exception of certain persons, to
stipulate for the payment of six per cent interest, so that the Treasury itself
cannot exact a higher rate than this from its debtors; whether they are
indebted to it in the first place, or whether rights of action have been
transferred to it by prior creditors in any way whatsoever.
TITLE IX.
CONCERNING THE REVOCATION OF DECISIONS RENDERED AGAINST THE TREASURY.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Acutianus.
It is a well-known rule of law that cases in which judgment is rendered against
the Treasury can be revoked within the three years next ensuing, and, even
after that time, if collusion should be established, or fraud clearly proved.
TTIITTLLEE XX..
CONCERNING PROPERTY WHICH HAS No OWNER, AND INCORPORATION.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian and the Caesars, to Euchiarius.
Your Highness should know that the property of persons dying intestate and
without leaving any lawful heirs is confiscated to Our Treasury,1 and that
municipalities which attempt to claim such property for themselves, on the
ground that they have permission to do so, ought not to be heard. Hence, if you
should afterwards ascertain that the property of persons dying intestate has
been seized by municipalities, under the pretext of certain privileges which
they enjoy, you will not hesitate to claim the said property for the benefit of
Our Treasury.
2. The Emperor Constantine to the Receiver ZEmilms.
If, when we make a donation of land or a house, in writing, and state that it
is given in its original condition, this expression signifies that it is
transferred with all its appurtenances; that is to say, with everything
belonging to it, including slaves, flocks, crops, and all rights attaching to
the property; so that whatever is necessary for the cultivation of the land, or
belongs to the house, may be embraced in the donation.
Given at Milan, on the sixth of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of
Constantine, Consul for the third time, and Licinius, 313.
3. The Emperors Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian to Florentius, Count of
Private Affairs.
Whenever any money is paid into Our Treasury as the result of confiscation, or
for any other lawful reason, it should be formally added to the funds of the
Empire, by the Count of Private Affairs, and a record of it made by the
receivers of the different provinces, and everything should be carefully set
forth in detail.
The written evidences of title by which lands become the property of Our
Treasury must be publicly attested, and those who, on their own authority,
attempt to appropriate anything for themselves from property of this
description, shall suffer the severest punishment.
Given on the fourth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Our Prince
Valentinian, and Victor.
4. The Emperors Honorius, Theodosius, and Constantius to Pal-ladius, Prsetorian
Prefect.
We order that the property of persons who die intestate shall be transferred to
the Treasury, if the deceased left no blood-relative in the line of descent,
nor any lawful heir.
Given at Ravenna, on the eighth of the Idesof July, during the Consulate of
Eustatius and Agricola, 421.

5. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Hieritocrates, Count of Private
Affairs.
Where property has no owner, or where, for any other reason, the title to it
vests in the Treasury, certain Palatines should be chosen and sworn, so that,
at their instance, the Governor of the province, in the presence of the
Attorney for the Crown, can make diligent inquiry whose property it was that
has no owner, and has escheated to the State, and how much there is, as well as
what is the nature of the same; and if, after proper notice has been given, it
should appear that there is no one legally entitled either to hold said
property, or to claim it, it shall be forfeited to the Treasury, and this shall
be established by the report of the Governor, as well as by documents drawn up
for this purpose; and the inventory of said property shall be forwarded to Us,
so that by Our command, if there is no owner, or there is some other good
cause, it shall be placed at the disposal of the Treasury.
This rule shall be observed with reference either to a portion of the property
or all of it, and where there is one claim, or several. If any fraud has been
committed at the expense of the Treasury, the persons who have been appointed
and are responsible shall not escape punishment. The Governor shall be fined
half the amount of his possessions, and the Attorney of the Treasury shall be
compelled to make good any loss which the Treasury has sustained through his
fault.
Given at Constantinople, on the seventh of the Idesof October, during the
Consulate of Our Lord the Emperor Theodosius, Consul for the fifth time, and he
who may be appointed his colleague, 435.
TITLE XI. CONCERNING INFORMERS.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Haterins.
Where an implied trust has been left to someone who is entitled to receive it,
there is no ground for information, for property cannot be left tacitly to
those who have no right to receive it openly.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Nicontius.
The duties of your office require that you should, by all means, diligently
prosecute the case of which information has been given by another by order of
the Attorney of the Treasury, and the perusal of the documents which have been
inserted into the petition clearly indicates that you did not voluntarily act
as informer. Therefore, the illustrious Governor of the province will take
special care that you shall not be personally molested, which would be an act
contrary to the practice of My reign.
3. The Same Emperor to Clcelius.
Anyone who is alleged by officials to have in his possession land or buildings
belonging to the Treasury cannot be branded with the disgrace or crime of an
informer, who can show that not he, but another, is the possessor of the
property.
4. The Emperor Philip to Candidus.
From the consideration of various laws, the conclusion is arrived at that
persons who defend the interests of the government cannot be accused of being
informers, as it is well known to all persons that only those who denounce
others to the Treasury belong to that execrable class.
5. The Emperor Constantine to the Inhabitants of the Provinces.
We order all judges to exercise great diligence, in the punishment of informers
who denounce others without first making application to the Advocate of the
Treasury, for it is a perfectly clear rule of law that where the Treasury is
entitled to any property from an estate which has no owner, or by the law, that
it can only legally be claimed by advocates representing the Treasury. But for
the reason that some persons, acting hastily, do not hesitate to denounce
others as having possession of property belonging to the Treasury, those who
consider themselves injured can invoke the severity of the law which is
provided against informers.
Given at Constantinople, on the eleventh of the Kalendsof April, during the
Consulate of Constantius and Albinus.
6. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Pallius, Consular of
Lydia.
We order that a slave who informs against his master shall, as an example to
all traitors, be subjected to the severest punishment, even if he should prove
his accusation. The crime of high treason, however, is excepted in such cases.
Given at Constantinople, on the seventh of the Kalendsof November, during the
Consulate of Antony and Syagrius, 382.
7 and8. These Laws are not Authentic.
TITLE XII.
CONCERNING THE ABOLITION OF THE DEMAND FOR PROPERTY.
1. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Eutro-pius, Prsetorian
Prefect.
When anyone has been convicted of the crime of treason and punished, his
property shall be confiscated to the Treasury (as is customary in the expiation
of this offence) and let no one venture to claim the said property as his own
under the pretext that it has been given him by the Emperor. Anyone who plans
anything in opposition to this law shall be considered to have violated it. As
We, however, are in certain cases frequently constrained by the importunity of
petitioners to grant what should not be conceded, We decree that if anything
should be obtained by an Imperial Rescript contrary to the provisions of this
law, as enacted, it shall be void.
Moreover, if We desire to grant anything out of property of this kind, We shall
do so at Our own instance, and not in compliance with the request or demand of
anyone whomsoever; and a concession of this kind shall, alone, possess
validity.
Given at Thessalonica, on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof December, during the
Consulate of Gratian, Consul for the fifth time, and Theodosius, 380.
2. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Florentius, Pras-torian Prefect.
As We desire to eradicate every pretext for seizing the fortunes of others, We
decree that hereafter no one shall have a right to claim such property. If any
person of either sex should die intestate, and leave no relatives, or a wife or
a husband, no matter what his or her status may be, nor to what sect he or she
may belong, nor under what title the estate may revert to the Treasury, let no
one dare to demand the property of said deceased person, no matter to what rank
or sect he or she may belong, if Our Treasury has a legal right to the same; as
it is not proper even for those who have authority to act by reason of their
official positions to violate Our laws with impunity. If the illustrious
Qusestor should, at any time, grant a petition presented to him for this
purpose, or should give a favorable answer to it, or if the illustrious Count
of Private Affairs should permit a petition to be drawn up, or authorize what
is included therein, he shall be punished and his rashness made an example to
others.
Again, We decree that those who draw up such papers for the purpose of
obtaining rescripts of this kind, or which have in view their enforcement
shall, as well as the Palatines who granted the prayers of the petitions or
were instrumental in their execution, be punished with confiscation. We decree
that, in like manner, property belonging to the State shall not be made the
subject of any petition, and that no pragmatic order, or Imperial note or any
other response proceeding from the throne, or any mandate obtained in violation
of this Our law, shall hereafter have any force or effect.
TITLE XIII. CONCERNING THOSE WHO DENOUNCE THEMSELVES.
1. The Emperor Constantine to Maximus.
If he to whom an estate has been tacitly left by a trust should immediately
communicate the fact to Your Highness, produce the documents establishing the
fact, and at once renounce all claim to the trust, he shall receive the third
part of the entire estate of the deceased as a reward for his good faith.
When a communication of this kind is made to you by the widow of the deceased,
and documentary evidence shows that the latter intended that she should be his
heir, she will be entitled to half of the estate by way of recompense, and it
shall be equally divided between herself
and the Treasury. She shall also have the privilege of the first choice of the
property, and the person who was guilty of the fraud, and was the enemy of both
the Treasury and the woman, shall be deprived of all his possessions, which
shall be confiscated to the Treasury, and he shall be deported to an island.
Given during the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Gallicanus and Bassus,
317.
TITLE XIV.
WHERE A JOINT OWNER OF PROPERTY DONATED BY THE EMPEROR DIES WITHOUT HEIRS.
1. The Emperor Constantine to Mygdonius, Marshal of the Palace.
We order that if anyone of those to whom any property has been given by Us
should die without leaving an heir, his share of the same shall, by way of
consolation, pass to his associate, rather than to any other person.
TITLE XV.
CONCERNING TREASURE TROVE. 1. The Emperor Leo to Erythrius, Praetorian Prefect.
Let no one hereafter annoy Us with petitions having reference to treasure found
either by himself or by someone else upon his own land or upon that of another,
for We give full power to everyone to seek for treasure on his own premises,
provided he does so without the practice of wicked arts and sacrifices
punishable by law, or by any other prohibited means (that is to say, where the
treasure has been hidden for a long time by the owners, who are unknown), and
having found the same, to make use of it. This manifestation of Our liberality
has been conceded in order that hereafter no malicious prosecution may be
instituted against those who have experienced the kindness of the Deity, as it
would be superfluous to request by a petition what has already been granted by
law, and the generosity of the Emperor.
Moreover, let no one dare to seek for hidden treasure for himself on the land
of others, without their consent, and especially where they are unwilling, and
do not know that this is being done. Where anyone thinks that an application
should be made to Us on this subject, or he has been found to have sought for
treasure on the premises of others, contrary to the provisions of this law, he
shall be compelled to surrender it to the owner of the land, and be punished as
a violator of this most salutary decree. If, however, he should find any
treasure on the land of another, while plowing or cultivating the same, or
under any other circumstances, without having had the design of searching for
it, he shall have the right to retain half of what he finds, and must restore
the other half to the owner of the land, and in this way each one will enjoy
what he is entitled to, and will not covet what belongs to others.
TITLE XVI.
CONCERNING TRIBUTES PAYABLE IN GRAIN AND MONEY.
1. This Law is not Authentic.
2. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus to Alienus.
An heir will be liable for the debts of the estate in proportion to his share
of the same, but the tribute of grain is absolutely payable by the person who
is in possession of the land, and gathers the crops.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Herennius.
Taxes are ordinarily imposed not on persons, but on property; and therefore the
Governor of the province will see that you are not compelled to pay more than
the value of your possessions demands.
4. The Emperor Constantine to Proculiamts.
All persons should be familiar with the amount of taxes which We have imposed,
and with the fact that no one has any power to collect more or less than that
amount. For if any vicegerent or Governor of a province should think that
someone ought to be released from the payment of any portion of his tax, that
from which he released another, he shall be forced to pay out of his own
property.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof July, during the
fourth Consulate of Constantine and Licinius, 315.
5. The Emperor Constantine to Uranius.
All persons should be compelled to pay their share of the public obligations,
for, by the law which We have promulgated, the taxes which We have imposed upon
Our beloved inhabitants of provinces are not extraordinary, and should not be
so designated.
Given on the third of the Nonesof February, during the Consulate of
Constantius, Consul for the second time, and Constans, 339.
6. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Dracontius, Vicegerent of Africa.
We order that tributes consisting of grain shall be transported to the
frontiers, when the places where they are situated and the proximity of the
land permit this to be done.
Given at Milan, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of
Valentinian and Valens, 365.
7. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Princi~ pius,
Prsetorian Prefect.
It is clear that a rescript obtained for the purpose of defrauding the public
by evading the tribute of grain can have no legal force. Therefore the
imposition of this tax shall affect all persons in the same manner.
Given at Aquileia, on the eighth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate
of Arcadius and Bauto, 385.
8. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Cyne-giuSf Praetorian
Prefect.
No owner of land shall have an excessive tax for the construction of buildings
or the transport of grain imposed upon him, but all shall bear the burden
equally, the distance and requirements of transportation having been duly taken
into account.
Given at Constantinople, on the tenth of the Kalendsof January, during the
Consulate of Arcadius and Bauto,.385.
9. The Same Emperors to Cynegius, Prsetorian Prefect.
The inland cities had formerly burdens imposed upon them by those situated on
the sea, and vice versa,so that they were subjected to more expense than the
amount of the tax. By the present law We forbid this to occur both now and
hereafter, and those who commit such acts are notified that they will be
punished with death.
Given at Valentia, on the third of the Nonesof September, during the Consulate
of Our Prince Honorius, and Evodius, 386.
10. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Minervius, Count of Private Affairs.
The privileges of rank cannot interfere with the public welfare, or the
requirements imposed by law; therefore, where anyone is entitled to the use of
land, and has not paid his taxes within the term of a year, nor during the
following six months, the person to whom he is said to be bound will be
compelled to pay whatever is due; and We desire this to apply to those who are
the owners of the property.
Published during the Consulate of Honorius, Consul for the fourth time, and
Eutychianus, 398.
11. The Same Emperors to Eutychianus, Prsetorian Prefect.
Judges who are negligent with reference to the claims of Our Treasury, and are
proved to have been careless in this respect shall be compelled to surrender
all the emoluments which they have acquired during their term of office.
12. The Emperors Theododius to Isidore, Prsetorian Prefect of lllyria.
We decree that only the amount shall be collected in every province which Your
Highness stated has recently been promised by each. No appraiser shall,
hereafter, be appointed for the valuation of land (which the inhabitants of the
provinces especially dread).
The remainder of the provinces shall not follow the example of the Macedonians,
and only half of the amount of the tribute, which they are known to have
offered, be collected. Those, however, who can show that no more than the third
part of what they owe can be raised by them, shall pay the same; after which
they may be released, so far as the remainder is concerned.
This rule shall always be observed hereafter, but is not applicable to the Holy
Church of the City of Thessalonica, which is notified that,
through Our indulgence, it is released from the payment of all taxes, and that
the State should not be injured by the exemption of private individuals from
the payment of tribute through the abuse of the name of the Church.
Given at Constantinople, on the sixth of the Idesof October, during the fifth
Consulate of Victor, 424.
13. This Law is not Authentic.
TITLE XVII. CONCERNING ADDITIONAL TAXES.
1. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Palladius, Prsetorian Prefect.
All persons, who are in possession of land under any title whatsoever, upon
which land a supplementary tax has been imposed, shall be compelled to pay the
same, as in the case of ordinary taxes. And in order that no doubt may arise on
this point, We hereby decree that a tax of this kind shall be considered an
ordinary one. Therefore no house either owned by the Crown, held under the
right of emphyteusis, or belonging to a private individual (even if it should
be shown to enjoy such a privilege) shall be released from the necessity of
payment of such a tax which shall not now, as heretofore, be considered
extraordinary, but by the terms of this law shall be deemed an ordinary one.
Given at Ravenna, on the seventh of the Idesof January, during the Consulate of
Theodosius, Consul for the seventh time, and Palladius, 417.
2. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Darius, Prsetorian Prefect.
Your Highness should indicate, by a regular notice despatched to the different
provinces, the amount of taxation to which each province is liable, before the
payment of the same becomes due, so that the owners of land may know in advance
what they will be required to pay, and not be taken unawares, no additional
expense be imposed upon the people of the province, and the exertion of
unlawful severity by officials charged with the collection of taxes be avoided.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of Isidore
and Senator, 436.
TITLE XVIII. CONCERNING SUPPLEMENTARY TAXES.
1. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to the Proconsuls, and all
Governors of Provinces.
No inhabitants of a province shall, in obedience to the written commands of the
Prefect, be compelled to pay any supplementary tax,
or any kind of tax whatsoever, unless the order has been confirmed by Us, and
strengthened by the Imperial authority, after which it may be imposed and
collected.
Given at Milan, on the seventh of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of
Antony and Syagrius, 382.
TITLE XIX. CONCERNING THE COLLECTORS OF TRIBUTE.
1. The Emperor Constantine.
The Ducenarii, Centenarii,and Sexagenariishould not attempt to collect the tax
due from debtors before having received complete lists of the said debtors, and
the amounts they owe from the Registrar of the City. The collection should be
made without any peculation.
Given during the Kalendsof November, during the fourth Consulate of Constantine
and Licinius, 315.
2. The Same Emperor to the People.
Let no one apprehend being placed in prison, whipped with leaded scourges,
tortured with weights, or subjected to any other punishment by perverse or
angry judges, for having been delinquent in the payment of taxes. Imprisonment
should only be inflicted upon those who are guilty, and judges and their
subordinate officials should be aware of this fact, and if they violate this
law shall be branded with infamy. Persons liable to the payment of taxes can,
with safety to themselves, appear before the Governor; or, if anyone should be
so destitute of human feeling as to abuse Our indulgence by being guilty of
obstinacy, he shall be confined in a military prison which is open, healthy,
and fitted for the occupation of men. If he should continue in his perverse
wickedness, the collector shall seize all his property, and make payment of the
taxes out of the same.
We believe that by granting this power to collectors, all persons will be more
inclined to the payment of those contributions which are demanded by the common
welfare for the use of Our army.
Given on the Kalendsof February, during the Consulship of Constantine, Consul
for the sixth time, and the Csesar Constantius, 320.
3. The Emperor Constantine to Nemesianus, Count of the Imperial Largesses.
Anyone who is ascertained to be indebted both to a private person and to the
Treasury, and has been arrested by an officer, shall be required to discharge
the entire debt; and anyone who rescues him shall be punished, and himself be
compelled to pay all that is due, if he is proved to have seized and removed
the said debtor.
Given at Nisibis, on the fourth of the Idesof May, during the Consulate of
Amantius and Albinus, 345.
4. The Same Emperor to Eustachius, Praetorian Prefect.The stewards and other
officers of Our private affairs can, when necessity demands it, be compelled by
the authority of the law to pay
any legal indebtedness in order that immunity from contribution to Our private
purse may not be imposed solely upon the people of the provinces.
Given at Rome, on the eighth of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of
Liminius and Catulinus, 349.
5. The Emperors Theodosius, Arcadius, and Honorius to Rufinus, Prsetorian
Prefect.
Those whose duty it is to collect taxes must state in writing the amount due,
and make a memorandum of their receipts, so that by this means the officials
may ascertain what has been collected> and what has been omitted; and the
receiver may not be compelled to undertake a long journey, and be absent from
his curia,and his private business suffer in consequence.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Idesof April, during the
Consulate of Theodosius, Consul for the third time, and Abundan-tius, 393.
6. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius.
Where debts are due to the Treasury, that is to say, contributions of grain and
other things which should be delivered at the Prefecture, as well as those
which require the services of Registers, the Governors of the provinces shall
be liable for the same, as they are required to provide for their collection,
and their authority must be exerted for that purpose.
7. The Same Emperors.
The opinators,that is to say, the collectors of military contributions,
together with the appointed judges and the subordinate officers of the latter,
are obliged to collect what is due within the term of a year. There is nothing
in common between them and the party in possession, for the latter must not
proceed against the soldier, but against the collector, if he is responsible.
Therefore, judges who permit the people of the province to be annoyed by
opinatorsare liable to the penalty of double the amount involved; and the
attendants of any official shall be liable to the sentence of deportation, if
they delegate to soldiers collections which should be made by themselves, and
members of the curiashall be condemned to temporary exile, if they think that
collections which they are required by law to make can be entrusted to
opinators.
The judge must decide who the debtors are, and see that their names are
carefully inscribed upon the registers, and that the officials, or members of
the curia,in compliance with the custom of the neighborhood, obtain from the
debtors the amounts of their assessments, so that, the taxes having been
collected, the opinatorsmay, at the end of the year, be able to rejoin the
divisions of the army to which they belong. When the collection is protracted
beyond the term of a year, the judges and their subordinate officials shall be
compelled to make up the deficiency to the soldiers without delay, and they
themselves shall be entitled to recourse against the persons Liable to the
payment
of the taxes. In case complaint is made to Us that the military collectors did
not make their returns within the prescribed time, double damages shall be
immediately collected from them, half of which shall be paid to the soldiers,
and the other half to the Treasury. For the purpose of aiding judges and their
officials, We permit them to employ all the authority of their offices against
obstinate debtors, without reward to their rank. If payment is delayed without
any good reason, recourse can be had to the stewards and agents, and their
land, and their names must also be communicated to Us.
Given on the third of the Idesof July, during the Consulate of Vicentius and
Fravittus, 401.
8. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian.
If the household of the Emperor, or indeed that of any other person, no matter
what his rank or fortune, actually possesses lands outside the principal town
of the district, which were not acquired through patronage, but by sale or any
other title whatsoever, and taxes imposed upon them by the State, and for which
the former owner was liable are not paid, the said lands shall be confiscated,
and assigned to the curiaof the city to whose jurisdiction they are subject.
It has appeared to Us advisable to provide for the public welfare and the
collection of the taxes to which the State is entitled by the enactment of this
law.
9. This Law is not Authentic.
TITLE XX. CONCERNING ILLEGAL COLLECTIONS.
1. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Apollodorus, Proconsul of Africa.
Where any sum over and above what is due has been exacted by officials of the
curia,their subordinates, or any other collectors, they shall be required to
surrender double the amount received, which shall, at once, be refunded to the
persons who paid it.
Where any collector is convicted of the crime of extortion, his avarice shall
be punished with death, if he should commit the offence a second time, after
having once been forbidden to do so.
Given on the day before the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Stilicho and
Aurelian, 400.
TITLE XXI.
CONCERNING THE SEIZURE AND SALE OF PROPERTY FOR THE PAYMENT OF TAXES.
1. The Emperor Constantine to the Africans.
The property of those who, through obstinacy, refused to pay what is due from
them to the Treasury, shall be sold, and the right of possession for the future
shall be fully assured to the purchasers.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of the
Cffisar Constantine, Consul for the fifth time, and Maximus, 327.
2. The Same Emperor.
It is sufficient for a debtor to be compelled to pay his tribute of grain, by
means of the seizure of his property.
Given on the eighth of the Idesof December, during the Consulate of
Constantius, Consul for the seventh time, and Constans, Consul for the third
time, 354.
TITLE XXII.
CONCERNING PUBLIC RECEIPTS, CURIAL SURVEYS OF LANDS, AND CIVIL APPOINTMENTS OF
TAXES.
1. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Anthemius.
For the purpose of exalting the fortunes of decurions that are of inferior
rank, and to repress the encroachments of others who are more powerful, as well
as to keep both classes under control, it has been decided that the official
valuations of property, which are required to be made under various
circumstances among the different orders of the people, shall not be carried
into execution before having been submitted to the Governors of provinces, and
approved in accordance with their decisions.
The money collected from contributions of this kind must be certified for by
the Receiver of the Treasury, and the receipt must contain the date, the name
of the consul, the month, the description of the land, and the amount, in which
way the nature of the property, as well as the justice of the tax, may appear,
and be established by documentary evidence.
The rule shall also be observed that, at the end of every four months, the
reports formally submitted to Your Excellency must include a detailed statement
of what has been collected, as well as of any balance due; so that all persons
who stand in awe of your authority may not venture to attempt anything for the
relief of the wealthy, or the oppression of the poor.
It is proper for this law to be obeyed, since the property of the opulent is
derived from the resources of the curia,as well as for the reason that both the
poor and the rich may reap the same benefit.
If any judge, accountant, or decurion should think that he can violate this
law, he shall be punished as Our authority may decide.
Given at Constantinople, on the seventh of the Kalendsof September, during the
fifth Consulate of Varanus.
2. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Celer, Proconsul of Africa.
Where a receipt has once been issued for the payment of taxes, the person to
whom it was given shall not be annoyed by another official. Therefore, Your
Excellency, having complied with the pro-
visions of this most salutary and equitable law, will hereafter prohibit those
who it is clear have obtained a receipt, and hence are not liable, from being
again compelled to discuss a transaction which has already been concluded.
Given at Ravenna, on the fifth of the Kalendsof May, after the fifth Consulate
of Felix and Taurus, 429.
3. The Emperor Martian to Constantine, Pr&torian Prefect.
Any inhabitant of the provinces and taxpayer who can prove payment of his tax,
after the expiration of a certain number of years, that is to say, if he can
produce receipts for three successive years, shall not be required to produce
any for those which precede this time; nor can he be compelled to make payment
of taxes for the time which has passed, unless either a decurion or some
subordinate official, deputy, accountant, or collector of public debts holds a
bond executed by the possessor of the property, or taxpayer; or if it should be
evident from the facts in the case that what he claims, that is to say, the
taxes for the time antedating the three years prescribed by law, are due to
him.
4. The Emperor Justinian.
We do not, under any circumstances, permit an exception on the ground that the
money was not paid to be pleaded against receipts signed by public officials,
evidencing the payment of either the entire amount, or a portion of the same.
TITLE XXIII.
CONCERNING THE LAW RELATING TO TAXES DUE TO THE FUND OF THE IMPERIAL LARGESSES.
1. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Julianus.
We order that the entire quantity of gold, silver, and other contributions
which it is customary to pay into the Treasury of the Imperial Largesses shall,
immediately after it has been collected, be turned over to the treasurer of
each province, or to the one nearest at hand, under the seals of the Registrar
and those whose duty it is to do so, as prescribed by former laws; and We order
those having charge of the Treasury to deliver the amount intact to the Count
of Private Affairs.
2. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Anthemius, Prse-torian Prefect.
The officers of the palace who have charge of the Imperial Largesses, as well
as the private purse of the Emperor, when they are sent into a province, shall
not, on their own authority, presume to institute legal proceedings against
possessors of property, for any cause whatsoever, or under any pretext of a
debt due to the Treasury,
whether any balance of unpaid taxes remains, or whether those of the present
time are payable; but the Governor of the province, having been applied to, may
compel this to be done, and may charge his subordinates with the performance of
this duty.
When, however, the Governor endeavors to avoid the trouble of complying with
the notices served upon him for this purpose; or, for any other reason, by his
own authority, transfers the charge of collecting the taxes to the said
officials of the palace, he himself, as well as his subordinate officers, shall
pay a fine of twenty pounds of gold to the Treasury.
Given at Constantinople, on the seventh of the Idesof December, during the
Consulate of Bassus and Philip, 408.
3. The Emperor Leo.
We decree that the secretaries attached to the subordinate officials of each
province for the purpose of keeping an account of their transactions shall not
be required to travel rapidly from one place to another, nor be subjected to
any other charge contrary to long continued custom; and they are also forbidden
to do this by the authority of the Prefect, so that, being freed from these
requirements, they may with more fidelity discharge their duties with reference
to largesses. If, at any time, this law should be rashly violated, then the
Governor of the province, as well as his subordinate officers, shall be
punished with a fine of thirty pounds of gold.
Moreover, the illustrious Count of the East and his subordinates shall have
power to restrain the illegal acts not only of the Governors, but also'of the
other officials, when information concerning them has been communicated to him
by the Palatines, and they will be liable to the same penalty if they do not,
under all circumstances, see that Our decrees are carried into effect.
(1) We hereby order that, in all the provinces, the appointment of special
collectors for the Treasury of the Largesses, as well as for the defence of the
secretaries, shall not only be made by the illustrious Governors of the
provinces, but also by the distinguished Proconsuls, or the Augustal Prefects,
and Vicegerents, together with their officers, whenever required, and notified
by the Palatines.
This having been done, after the appointment of the special collectors for the
Treasury of the Largesses, neither the Governors of provinces nor their
subordinates, nor the decurions, shall be permitted to remove any of the sums
collected which belong to the Imperial Treasury, or which should be transferred
to the provincial treasurers, or to any other fund than that to which it
belongs. Every four months, reports must be made by the proper accountant of
the amounts collected and appearing on the public registers, to be transmitted
to the capital of the Empire, on the responsibility of the Governor of the
province. The judges themselves, as well as their subordinates, are hereby
notified that they will be subjected to the penalty above mentioned, if the
present law, which We have promulgated, should not be observed in every
respect.
4. The Same Emperor.
We order that if the levy issued by the Prefecture to the different provinces
every year, according to custom, should fail to provide for the taxes payable
to the Treasury of the Largesses, or for some reason the collection of said
taxes should not take place, the illustrious Proconsuls as well as the
Vicegerents and the distinguished Count of the East, the Augustal Prefect, the
Governors of provinces and their subordinates, together with the decurions,
shall have authority to make the collection, and they must constantly bear in
mind that they will be liable to a fine of twenty pounds of gold if anything
less than what ancient and long-continued custom has established as due to the
fund of the Imperial Largesses should be collected or paid into the Imperial
Treasury.
TITLE XXIV. No LABOR SHALL BE REQUIRED OF TAXPAYERS.
1. The Emperors Valens, Gratia/n, and Valentinian to Viventius, Praetorian
Prefect.
Your Highness must see that an end is put to the performance of labor which, up
to this time, has been illegally exacted from the inhabitants of the provinces.
Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Our Prince
Valentinian, and Victor, 369.
TITLE XXV.
EXEMPTION FROM TAXATION SHALL BE GRANTED TO NO
ONE.
1. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to the People.
Under the terms of the present Edict, the accountants of municipalities shall
be subjected to punishment by fire, if they, induced either by fraud, bribery,
or the exertion of power, afford anyone unlawful immunity from taxation.
All special exemptions not included in the preceding provisions are hereby
absolutely abolished, and the necessity for the payment of taxes, when
confirmed by the judges of the provinces and the officials having charge of the
same, is hereby imposed upon all persons.
Given at Milan, on the third of the Nonesof March, during the Consulate of
Merobaudus, Consul for the second time, and Saturninus, 383.
2. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius.
Owners of property in Bithynia and other provinces shall be compelled to pay
taxes for the repair of public highways, and other charges of this kind, in
proportion to the number of acres of land or head of cattle which they are

CONCERNING PROPERTY STORED IN PUBLIC WAREHOUSES.
1. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Volusianus, Prefect of the City.
We desire all articles stored in public warehouses to be used in such a way
that what is brought from your prefecture shall not be placed in the warehouses
until the grain now there has been exhausted, and if a portion of the latter
should be found to be spoiled, so that it cannot be used without complaint,
some of what is new shall be mixed with it, in such a way that what has been
damaged may be concealed by the addition, and the Treasury sustain no loss. You
should, according to your discretion and judgment, select a man for this duty
who is of high character, prudent, and faithful, and by all means conscious of
his own integrity, by whom a guard must be appointed, as well as an inspector
who shall either measure the grain, or make a correct estimate of the amount
stored in the warehouse.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof April, during the Consulate of the Divine
Jovian, and Varronianus, 364.
2. The Same Emperors and Gratian.
We desire that whenever you go to a city or a military post, you at once
inspect the public warehouses, in order that provisions of excellent quality
may be furnished Our devoted soldiers; for if through your neglect of the
duties of your office, and the bad condition of the roofs of 'the buildings,
any of the provisions should be spoiled by rain, you will be responsible for
the damage.
3. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Anatolius, Prsetorian Prefect of
Illyria.
No one, hereafter, shall have the right to touch government property stored in
warehouses, for if any person should be so rash as to dare to appropriate for
himself any of the property aforesaid, he is hereby notified that he will be
liable to the penalty of deportation, which has been prescribed by Us, and will
be compelled to suffer the loss of all his property.
Given at Constantinople, on the seventh of the Idesof July, during the
Consulate of Csesarius and Atticus, 397.
TITLE XXVII.
No ONE SHALL BE PERMITTED TO REFUSE TO SELL PROPERTY, AND CONCERNING THE DUTY
OF MAKING PURCHASES FOR THE PUBLIC BENEFIT.
1. The Emperor Anastasius.
We decree that when, through urgent necessity, purchases of wheat, barley, or
other grain take place in any province whatsoever,
no owner of said property shall, under the pretext of any privilege whatsoever,
have the right to refuse to sell it, and that in accordance with the terms of
this, Our most salutary law, permission shall never be given to the possessor
of such articles in any way or at any time, to avail himself of any rescript,
pragmatic sanction, or judicial decree, by which he may claim immunity.
Therefore We desire that these burdens shall be imposed upon all persons in
proportion to the allotment of each, and We do not allow even Our own
household, or that of Our Most Serene Consort, to be exempt from this
obligation.
2 and3. These Laws are not Authentic.
TITLE XXVIII.
CONCERNING THE COLLECTION OF TAXES ON DONATIONS
AND CONCEENING TRIBUTES AND PROPERTY CHARGED
WITH PAYMENTS IN KIND.
1. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Her-mocrites,
Praetorian Prefect.
We decree that the regulation of Antiochus of distinguished memory, which
levied a certain tax on tributary property in the name of the law, shall not be
repealed. For as this became a part of the law, and was required to be paid
every year, We do not permit anyone to be exempt from it, either in the past,
or in the future.
We desire that the rule above mentioned shall be observed, not only with
reference to past time, but also with reference to that which is to come, and
with respect to tributary property, as well as such as has been donated by the
Emperor, along with any charged with the payment of tribute in kind, or whose
nature has been changed, or which passes under some new designation, and that
no trouble need ever be anticipated on account of the imposition of additional
charges.
We not only relax the rule with reference to the past, but decree that nothing
new and no increase of the burden shall be ordered in the future, and that,
hereafter, no one shall be permitted to have hiis property exempt in opposition
to the Imperial Decrees. Your Highness is advised that if, at any time, a
rescript contrary to the present law should be sent to you with Our sanction,
or if you should'obey any Imperial Mandate (even if one should emanate from Us)
which is contrary to the provisions of this law, or anyone should think that
debtors ought to be exposed to a hardship of this kind, he is hereby notified
that he will be liable to a fine of two hundred pounds of gold.
TITLE XXIX. CONCERNING THE PAYMENT OF TAXATION IN COPPER.
1. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Hilarius.
We consent that the payment of taxes in copper, which is collected from the
inhabitants of certain provinces, may be made in gold, so
that one solidusof gold may be paid by the owner of the property instead of
twenty pounds of copper. .
Given at Milan, on the fifth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Arcadius, Consul for the fourth time, and Honorius, Consul for the third time,
396.
TITLE XXXXXX..CONCERNING ASSESSORS.
1. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to An-themius, Vicegerent
of the Spains.
Whenever it is established that property has been unjustly appraised, and the
assessor cannot give a good and sufficient reason for the estimate which he
made, he himself shall immediately be compelled to make good the loss, to which
he wrongfully subjected the debtor.
Given on the day before the Idesof May, during the Consulate of Our Prince
Valentinian, and Victor, 369.
2. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Messala, Prsstorian Prefect.
In order to prevent extortion being practiced against persons liable to
taxation, because of the loss of their receipts, We decree that when receipts
have been mentioned in the public records as having been given either by
assessors or other officials, the sums paid cannot again be unjustly demanded.
Given at Milan, on the fifth of the. Kalendsof December, during the Consulate
of Stilicho and Aurelian, 400.
3. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian.
We decree that in all provinces and cities, no persons, including members of
Our Consistory, soldiers, and advocates, whether they are in practice or not,
or belong to the provincial bar, shall be exempt from the performance of their
official duties, so far as the appraisement of property is concerned.
4. This Law is not Authentic.
TITLE XXXI.
CONCERNING DECURIONS AND THEIR SONS WHO ARE CONSIDERED DECURIONS, AND IN WHAT
WAYS THEY MAY BE RELEASED FROM THE DUTIES OF THE DECU-
RIONATE.
1. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus.
If, in accordance with the wishes of your father, the office of de-curion was
conferred upon you during his lifetime, his heirs will be liable to the State,
for, in this instance, your father is considered to
act as surety for you, but recourse cannot be had to him until after your
property has been exhausted.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximum.
It is necessary for the magistrates, after having formally summoned the
decurions to their place of meeting, to appoint them to their several
employments, and, by means of a public officer to notify each one of them of
the duty which he is to perform, and for which he was appointed; and he will
have the right to appeal if he desires to do so, and present his case before
the Governor of the province in the usual way. If the latter should decide that
the appointment ought not to have been made, the expenses of litigation must be
refunded to the plaintiff by the official responsible for it.
3. The Same Emperors and Ctesars.
As you voluntarily accepted the office of the decurionate, you cannot be
released, even though you state that you are advanced in years.
4. The Same Emperors and Csesars.
As there is no doubt that an adoptive son himself becomes a de-curion on
account of the office of his adoptive father, it is not proper that you should
be guilty of atrocious cruelty to one whom you have accepted in the place of
natural offspring; nor can unlawful bodily torture be inflicted upon him by the
Governor of the province, but he should be punished by the imposition of a
suitable penalty.
5. The Same Emperors and Caesars.
You have been incorrectly informed that sons who are under paternal control can
be called to the performance of official duties. Still, if you did not give
your consent to the appointment of your son, you cannot be held liable for his
administration.
6. The Same Emperors and Csesars.
The laws do not prohibit even illiterate persons from discharging the duties of
decurions.
7. The Same Emperors and Csesars.
Although brothers have an undivided interest in their property, each one will,
nevertheless, be individually responsible for the discharge of his official
duties.
8. The Same Emperors and Csesars.
Infamy, which should be shunned by you, will deprive you of the office that you
have obtained, which the loss of your eyesight will not do.
9. The Same Emperors and Csesars.
It is established that, among decurions, a father will take precedence over
those who have no children.
10. The Same Emperors and Csesars.
If the Governor of the province should find that your father is more than
seventy years of age, he will see that he enjoys exemption from personal
service in office.
11. The Same Emperors and Csesars.
There is no doubt that a wife cannot be held responsible for the obligations of
her husband, as decurion.
12. The Same Emperors and Csesars.
It is settled that anyone branded with infamy is not entitled to immunity, as
this privilege only attaches to persons of unblemished character.
13. The Same Emperors and Csesars.
Neither the decurions of a Governor, the age of fifty years, nor the gout,
affords a valid excuse for exemption from the duties of the decurionate.
14. The Emperor Constantine to Evagrius.
No judge shall, on his own responsibility, release a man from the office of
decurion; for if anyone should be so unfortunate as to deserve relief, his case
must be referred to Us, so that he may be relieved from his official duties for
a certain time.
Published on the Idesof March, during the third Consulate of Constantine and
Licinius, 313.
15. The Same Emperor to Mechilius Hilarian.
We wish all decurions to refrain from exercising the functions of
notaries.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of Sabinus
and Rufinus, 316.
16. The Same Emperor to Hilarian, Proconsul of Africa.
If any decurion should, either on account of his own affairs, or of those of
the State, be compelled to appear before Our Council, he shall not leave before
communicating to the presiding judge the reason for his journey, and obtaining
his permission to depart. If anyone should be so audacious as to disregard this
law, he shall undergo suitable punishment for his act.
Published at Carthage, on the sixth of the Idesof July, during the third
Consulate of Crispus and Constantine, 324.
17. The Same Emperor to Evagrius, Praetorian Prefect.
Anyone who abandons the office of decurionate to enlist in the army shall be
recalled to his curia.
Given on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of
Constantine, Consul for the second time, and the Caesar Con-stantius, 326.
18. The Same Emperor.
Where anyone appointed to the magistracy takes to flight, and, while sought
for, obstinately remains concealed, his property shall be given to those who at
that time are called to perform in his place the functions of the duumvirate,
so that if he should afterwards be found, he may be compelled to act as duumvir
for two years. All persons who refuse to discharge their public duties shall be
liable under the same rule.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of
Constantine, Consul for the ninth time, and Constantius, Consul for the fourth
time, 326.
19. The Same Emperor to Lucretius Paternus.
Having annulled the rescripts by which exemption from the duties of civil
office is conceded to all, persons are hereby subjected to the discharge of
these civil duties, so that no release will be valid, even if granted with the
consent of the people or the curia,but all citizens are required to perform
their civil obligations.
Given at Heraclia, on the eighth of the Kalendsof November, during the
Consulate of Constantine, Consul for the eighth time, and Constantius, Consul
for the fourth time, 326.
20. The Emperors Constantius and Constans to the Decurions of the City of
Constantine.
Your Highness must require the magistrates of the City of the Cyreneians who
have abandoned their places to return, and they shall immediately be required
to refund in full any expense incurred by the City on their account.
Given on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of
Acyndinus and Proculus, 340.
21. The Same Emperors to Count Nemesianus.
The decurions of all cities should suffer no anxiety on account of property
belonging to Our private domain, nor should they be subjected to any
extraordinary burdens of this kind, as it will be sufficient if they properly
discharge duties of their office.
Given on the day before the Idesof August, during the Consulate of Acyndinus
and Proculus, 340.
22. The Emperor Julian to Julian, Count of the East.
Former Emperors permitted children born of mothers whose families are connected
with the decurionate to belong to the curiaof Antioch, when the status of their
fathers did not entitle them to any such privilege.
Given at Antioch, on the fifth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate
of Mamertinus and Nevitta, 362.
23. The Same Emperor to Julian, Count of the East.Provision should be made to
prevent those who have only recently been appointed to the Order of Decurionate
from being burdened with
the debts of their predecessors, for those who have previously contracted such
obligations should be compelled to pay them, and you must not suffer their
successors to be molested on account of the indebtedness of others.
Published on the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of
Mamertinus and Nevitta, 362.
24. The Same Emperor to Leontius, Consular of Palestine.

from the duties of his office.
Given at Antioch, on the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Julian,
Consul for the fourth time, and Sallust, 363.
25. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to the Byzantines.
Decurions cannot, by the order of a Governor, be compelled to go beyond the
limits of their city, unless public necessity requires it.
Given at Aquileia, on the day before the Idesof September, during the Consulate
of Jovian and Varronian, 364.
26. The Same Emperors to Modestus, Prsetorian Prefect.
Some decurions, induced by idleness, abandon their office in the city, seek
solitude and secret places, and, under the pretence of religion, associate with
hermits. Therefore, by the present law, We order that persons of this kind
shall be arrested, torn from their hiding-places, and recalled for the purpose
of performing their municipal functions; and, by the terms of this Our law, We
decree that those who are obliged to discharge public duties cannot avoid them
under the pretext of attending to their private affairs.
Published on the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of Valentinian and
Valens, 365.
27. The Same Emperors to the Sitisensian Moors.
Anyone required to perform the duties of the decurionate cannot claim exemption
on account of a privilege bestowed upon his father as a reward for service in
the army. If he is descended from a grandfather who was a soldier, and a father
who was a decurion, he will succeed to the duties of his father.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Valentinian
and Valens, 365.

Consulate of Valentinian and Valens, 368.

Children born in wedlock to those who are attached to Our household, and whose
father is a decurion, do not follow the condition of their father, but that of
their mother.
30. The Same Emperors.
There is no doubt that the Attorneys of the State can make use of public
actions.
31. The Emperors Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian to Modestus, Prsetorian
Prefect.
Persons, no matter what their lineage may be, who are descended from decurions,
are obliged to perform the duties of public office. Moreover, those who conceal
them, and continue to do so, thereby subordinating the public welfare to their
own interest, shall be condemned to infamy, and their property shall be
confiscated.
Given on the third of the Idesof July, during the Consulate of Gratian, Consul
for the second time, and Probus, 371.
32. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Neo* therius,
Prsetorian Prefect.
Artisans who have renounced their position as decurions, and the official
duties required of them, shall be restored to their order. Other persons
implicated shall be severely punished.
Given at Thessalonica, on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof April, during the
Consulate of Gratian, Consul for the fifth time, and Theodosius, 380.
33. The Same Emperors to Eutropius, Prsetorian Prefect.
All judges and Governors of provinces must refrain from the rash usurpation of
authority, and remember that they cannot subject persons of eminent rank, or
decurions, to corporeal punishment for any negligence or error of which they
may be guilty. Therefore, if a judge, in an outburst of anger, should dare to
subject to torture any man of illustrious rank, or a decurion, or a senator of
his curia(if it is necessary to say so), he shall be fined twenty pounds of
gold, and be branded with perpetual infamy, which he cannot evade by means of a
special Imperial Rescript; and his subordinates shall be compelled to pay a
fine of fifty pounds of gold to the Treasury, for the reason that they did not
resist the illegal act of the judge, which We have given them full power to do.
Given at Heraclia, on the twelfth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate
of Eucherius and Syagrius, 381.
34. The Same Emperors to Florus, Prsetorian Prefect.
When anyone thinks that the management of his affairs should be entrusted to a
decurion, he shall be severely punished, after having been deprived of his
rank. The official, however, who, unmindful of his freedom and his position,
degraded himself by accepting such a servile employment, shall be sent into
exile.1
1 At Rome, not only manual labor, but also the care and supervision of estates,
and the business of accountants, were principally in the hands of slaves, who
were often men of excellent education and great financial ability.
Notwithstanding their talents and acquirements, the occupations exercised by
them were generally considered debasing, and unworthy of the dignity of a
freeman.ED.
35. The Same Emperors to Posthumianus, Prsetorian Prefect.
Your Highness must see that the decrees formerly promulgated are obeyed by the
sons of decurions, and that those who, under the pretext of being advocates,
refuse to obey the rules of their order, are compelled to discharge all their
duties; for although necessity may not demand that this be done, still the
country does not release them from
their performance.
Moreover, Your Highness must provide that the sons of teachers, who are
descended from the families of decurions, are, in like manner, forced to
discharge the municipal employments to which they are
liable.
Given at Constantinople, on the eighth of the Idesof April, during the
Consulate of Merobaudus, Consul for the second time, and Satur-ninus, 383.
36. The Same Emperors to Basilius, Count of the Sacred Largesses.
Every decurion, as in the case of the Senatorial Order, shall follow the
condition of his father, nor shall any rescript, obtained for special purposes,
be valid in cases of this kind, where someone, relying upon the origin of his
mother, has passed from a superior to an inferior curia,nor will any exception
to this rule be permitted, no matter what the provincial custom may be.
Given at Rome, on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of
Merobaudus, Consul for the second time, and Saturninus, 383.
37. The Same Emperors to Posthumianus, Prsetorian Prefect.
Whenever persons who have obtained Imperial Rescripts avail themselves of the
same to be released from duties to which their origin, or any decision rendered
between the parties has made them liable, they will hereafter be able to
entertain no hope of evading the responsibility of their office, under the
pretext of an Imperial Rescript.
Given at Constantinople, on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof August, during the
Consulate of Merobaudus, Consul for the second time, and Saturninus, 383.
38. The Same Emperors to Cynegius, Prsetorian Prefect.
Let no person be assigned to a curiaby way of penalty, unless he should be a
fugitive, and have enlisted in the army in order to avoid performing the duties
of the station in which he was born. You will therefore notify all magistrates
under your jurisdiction that they are forbidden to permit any violator of the
law to be assigned to a curiaas a penalty, as one who has been guilty of crime
should not be honored, but subjected to punishment.
Given at Constantinople, on the eighth of the Idesof November, during the
Consulate of Richomer and Clearchus, 384.
39. The Same Emperors to Eusignius, Prsetorian Prefect.

misappropriated the public funds, or to have fraudulently made unlawful
assessments, or to have collected more than was due, shall, in accordance with
the custom of former times, be whipped with a scourge loaded with lead, by your
order, if he obtained his place from you, or by that of the ordinary judges
responsible for his appointment.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof April, under the Consulate of
Valentinian, Consul for the third time, and Eutropius, 387.
41. The Same Emperors to Cynegius, Prsetorian Prefect.
A decurion shall not, either by the solicitation of votes, or by intrigue,
change the condition in which he was born, and if he is entitled to relinquish
it on account of old age, he cannot do so before the appointment of his
successor, which usually takes place immediately.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Nonesof July, during the
Consulate of Valentinian, Consul for the third time, and Eutropius, 387.
42. The Emperors Theodosius, Arcadius, and Honorius to Abun-dantius, Count, and
General of Both Branches of the Service.
There is nothing in common between military men and decurions, and they are
hereby notified that they can do nothing which will not subject them to
superior authority. And no commander or Count shall permit any decurion or
person of high rank to suffer any injury, or be struck, or seriously beaten.
If anyone should hereafter, by a rash and inconsiderate act, inflict an illegal
injury upon a chief of the decurions, he is notified that he will be fined ten
pounds of gold.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Kalendsof August, during the
Consulate of Arcadius and Rufinus, 392.
43. The Same Emperors to Rufinus, Praetorian Prefect.
You must show no hesitation in causing all persons who are obliged by their
descent to exercise the functions of a decurion to be returned to their duties,
when they claim exemption by reason of various privileges and pretexts based
upon official documents, for We do not permit even rescripts or memoranda to be
of any avail in evading the duties of public office.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Idesof April, during the
Consulate of Theodosius, Consul for the third time, and Abun-dantius, 393.
44. The Same Emperors to Rufinus, Prsetorian Prefect.
No one shall be attached to a decurionate by reason of his claim that his
mother was connected with the family of such an official, because the weakness
of woman never renders persons liable to the performance of duties of this
kind, from which she herself is exempt.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifth of the Idesof August, during the
Consulate of Theodosius, Consul for the third time, and Abundan-tius, 393.
45. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Theodore, Prsetorian Prefect.

incapable of performing their public functions.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of
Olybrius and Probinus, 395.
46. The Same Emperors to Ennoius, Proconsul of Africa.
Appointments should not be postponed when all those who are inscribed upon the
registers of the curiaare unable to be present, for the absence of a few
members, whether it be unavoidable or accidental, does not invalidate an act
formally agreed to by a two-thirds majority, as two-thirds of the order is
considered to represent the voice of the entire curiaof the city.
Given at Milan, on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate
of Olybrius and Probinus, 395.
47. The Same Emperors.
Decurions who have obtained the rank of count should exercise carefully
supervision over those subject to their authority, and not' think that by the
acquisition of their new dignity they are entitled to regard the orders of
judges with contempt. If they continue to be guilty of the same fault, they
should be subjected to a fine of five pounds of gold, and be deprived of the
position of which they are unworthy.
Given at Constantinople, on the fourth of the Kalendsof January, during .the
Consulate of Olybrius and Probinus, 395.
48. The Same Emperors.

All decurions, without exemption, shall remain forever attached to their
original and proper curia;and all those who, either by fraud or intrigue, have

that they shall not only be recalled to their curia,but shall also be compelled
to perform all the duties of their offices from the very beginning.
Given at Constantinople, on the eighth of the Kalendsof November, during the
Consulate of Honorius, Consul for the fourth time, and Eutychianus, 398.
51. The Same Emperors and Theodosius to Messala, Prsetorian Prefect.
Although it has been provided by a suitable amendment that decurions who have
abandoned their duties under a pretext of enlisting in the army shall be
returned to their offices, still, for the reason that they committed this act
with fraudulent intent, so that, having passed the boundaries of their
provinces, and access to them being no longer available, they might obtain
dismissal in foreign countries, in order that they may no longer entertain the
hope of concealment to the disadvantage of the decurionate, and secure the
benefit of immunity, it is hereby decided that if any of them should attempt to
withdraw from the decurionate, or abandon it, their property shall be used to
indemnify the curiawhich they have deserted, if, for the purpose of escaping
prosecution, or evading their civil obligations, they should join the army,
which is forbidden, or be guilty of any fraud whatsoever.
Therefore, if after having been summoned by proclamation (being such persons as
clearly belong to the curia),they prefer to remain concealed, rather than to
return within the period of a year, they are hereby notified that, after the
year has elapsed, their property shall be seized by the authority of the
Governor of the province for the benefit of the curiawhich they have deserted.
No complaints which they may make concerning the shortness of the time shall be
heard.
Given on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of
Theodore, Consul for the fifth time, 399.
52. The Same Emperors to Probinus, Proconsul of Africa.
Can a magistrate be found who is so unjust as to compel a decurion, belonging
to a city which abounds in them, to perform his official functions longer or
more frequently than he should do, simply because some of them do not become
familiar with the duties of their employment, and others are, in consequence,
compelled to perform them constantly and repeatedly?
Given at Milan, on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate
of Csesarius and Atticus, 397.
53. The Same Emperors to Eucherius, Proconsul of Africa.

Honorius, Consul for the ninth time, and Theodosius, 412.
54. The Same Emperors to Palladius, Prsetorian Prefect.
We order by this general law, that if any official should desire to claim a
decurion belonging to his curia,he shall be permitted to arrest him with his
own hand, if he cannot obtain the aid of the Governor, but he is notified that
the fugitive should be immediately brought before the Governor for examination
(so that if any question should arise as to his having a good defense, it may
be heard), and if the said official does not dispose of the case within three
months from the time of its commencement, and restore the defendant, if
convicted, to the performance of his duties, after having imposed the penalty;
or decide that he is free from liability, he shall be compelled to pay a fine
of ten pounds of gold, and his subordinate officers shall also be mulcted in an
equal sum.

in the army, he shall not be permitted to avail himself of any prescription,
but must be returned to his former condition; and neither he himself, nor any
of his children born after an event of this kind has occurred, shall be
permitted to renounce the duties which they owe to the State.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Nonesof April, during the
Consulate of Isidore and Senator, 436.
56. The Same Emperors to Isidore, Prsetorian Prefect.
The Chief decurions of Alexandria, although they perform the functions of
advocates, are, nevertheless, not charged with any duties outside of the city,
nor are they compelled to perform any public duty except in their own
municipality. The decurion highest in rank who, after having filled all the
subordinate offices, has obtained this position, shall, after having enjoyed,
for the term of two years, the dignity to which he has attained, be raised to
the rank of count, but he will still continue to be a decurion.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Nonesof June, during the
Consulate of Isidore and Senator, 436.
57. The Same Emperors to Isidore, Prastorian Prefect.
We decree that the five Chief Decurions of the City of Alexandria shall be
exempt from all corporeal punishment, and free to defend the advantages of
their country with their voices. They can, however, if guilty of any criminal
act, be subject to a pecuniary fine, which shall
be imposed by the distinguished augustal prefect in the presence of the curia.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Nonesof June, during the
Consulate of Isidore and Senator, 436.
58. The Same Emperors to Isidore, Praetorian Prefect.
Anyone who has served as a public official for forty years, in the City of
Alexandria, shall, in consideration of his merits, be exempt from corporeal,
but not from pecuniary penalties, so that persons who are well and favorably
known may be entitled to this privilege, and those who are unworthy may not
indiscriminately enjoy it.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Nonesof June, during the
Consulate of Isidore and Senator, 436.
59. The Same Emperors to Isidore, Prsetorian Prefect.
If the hypomnematographishould appoint persons to public office with their
consent, We order that the confirmation of the illustrious augustal prefect,
who is frequently corrupt, shall not be required, but that the consent of both
parties will be sufficient in order that the appointee may begin to discharge
the duties which he has not refused; still, the above-mentioned judge must be
notified of the appointment which has been made without his sanction, and if he
should delay to acquiesce in, or confirm the appointment, he is hereby notified
that he will be liable to a fine of twenty pounds of gold.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Nonesof August, during the
Consulship of Isidore and Senator, 436.
60. The Same Emperors.
No one who became a member of a curiaby birth can perform his official
functions by means of a substitute, but he himself must discharge the duty
which he owes to his city, even though he may be a man of high rank, unless
this has been granted him as a special privilege. Those who have attained to
the rank of illustrious are not prohibited from discharging their duties
through substitutes, but they do so at the risk of their property.
61. The Emperor Leo.
We decree that neither the illustrious Dorotheus, the title to whose property
must not be called in question, nor Irenseus, the eminent tribune and notary,
shall be subject to annoyance on account of their having inherited the
condition of decurion, although their parents had not attained to the rank of
illustrious before they were born. Their children, also, whether they are now
in existence, or may subsequently come into the world, as well as their
descendants to the end of time, shall be exempt from the civil obligations
imposed by the condition of decurion; and the law of the Emperor Julian, of
Divine Memory, which was promulgated with reference to the maternal line and
its relations to the decurionate of the City of Antioch, shall not, in any
respect apply to the illustrious Dorotheus, or the eminent Ironeus, or to any
of
their property, or to their children who are in existence at present, or may be
born hereafter, nor will it have any effect so far as the property of the
latter is concerned. We order, however, that this law shall continue to be
applicable to all persons connected through the maternal line with the
decurionate of the said City of Antioch.
62. The Same Emperor.
If a child born to the daughter of a decurion of the magnificent City of
Antioch, and to a father who is not liable to the performance of civil duties
in any other town, should, while being examined by a judge of the province,
voluntarily acknowledge, or be proved to be the son of the daughter of a
decurion, and his name should be recorded in the register of that order, he
must not expect to have the power to deny or evade the duties imposed upon him
by his condition; and let him not attempt to reject the position in the
curiaacquired through his maternal grandfather, or entertain any doubt that he
is obliged to perform the functions of the decurionate.
If, however, any curiato which the present law refers should think that a child
born of the daughter of a decurion ought to be excluded from membership, it
can, under no circumstances, exclude his offspring, for We do not suffer a
public charge to be imposed upon grandsons, great-grandsons, or the more remote
descendants of a person who has been excluded from membership in the curia,and
is the child of the daughter of a decurion.
63. The Same Emperor.
We decree that neither the persons nor the property of men of illustrious rank
shall be molested on account of their status as members of a curia,and anyone
who makes an attempt to do so shall pay the penalty prescribed for sacrilege.
(1) No one can doubt that all those born to a father who has held any high
employment, or is still discharging the duties of the same, can, with his
father, be subject to annoyance because of his connection with the decurionate,
and both their persons and property shall be free from molestation on this
account.
64. The Emperor Zeno.
We wish that none of those liable to perform the duties of the decurionate who,
from the beginning of Our reign, have been, or may be appointed to the office
of Count of Private Affairs, either of the Emperor, or of the Empress, or to
that of Count of the Sacred Largesses, or Count of Domestic Affairs, or
Qusestor, or Master of the Offices, shall, for this reason, be exempt from the
obligations of the decurionate, but they shall be liable to them, together with
their children, no matter when they may have been born; and a lien shall exist
on their property to insure the performance of the functions of the
decurionate, after they have relinquished the administration of their other
employment, unless they have been exempted in this respect by the grant of well
known legal privileges, for We desire all privileges
conceded by the Imperial Constitutions to be preserved intact and inviolate.
In order, however, that persons appointed to such offices may not appear to
have only an empty name, they can discharge the duties of the decurionate by
means of substitutes selected by themselves, at the risk of their own property,
and will retain the privileges of their rank unimpaired. Moreover, We decree
that those who have acquired any of the dignities aforesaid before the
beginning of Our reign shall, along with their property, be released from the
cpnnections and burdens of the decurionate, and this also applies to any
children which may have been born to them after they attained the dignity
aforesaid.
Again, with reference to those who, at any time, have become, or may hereafter
become patricians, consuls, or men of consular rank, or generals of the army,
or Praetorian Prefects of the East, or of Illyria; or who have obtained the
government of any city while they were administering the offices aforesaid, or
may hereafter adminster them, We decree that they shall, together with their
property and all children born to them after being raised to the dignity
aforesaid, be released from all the obligations and burdens of the decurionate.
65. The Emperor Anastasius.
We think that the Constitution of the Emperor Zeno, of Divine Memory, which was
promulgated with reference to decurions, after their exemption from the
obligations of their condition by the exercise of high employments, should only
be corrected in that part which provides that those who, before the said
constitution was published (and from the beginning of the reign of the Emperor
Zeno, of Divine Memory) had been raised to the dignity of Count of Private
Affairs of the Emperor, or Empress, or to that of Count of the Sacred
Largesses, or to that of Count of Domestic Affairs, or to that of Quaestor, or
Master of the Offices, although they may be engaged in the actual
administration of one of the employments aforesaid, shall, by no means, be
permitted to evade the duties imposed by the decurionate; but shall be bound,
together with their children (no matter when the latter were born) and their
property, to discharge the duties of the decurionate, after they have
relinquished the administration of one of the offices aforesaid, unless they
have been exempted by some well-known legal privilege. For We order that any
privileges which may have previously been acquired by them through their
administration of one of the high offices aforesaid shall be enjoyed by them
intact and unimpaired, as well as by their children and their property, where
they have administered the affairs of all the offices above mentioned, or of
only one of the same, so that by the release of the duties and the civil
functions attaching to their condition which was granted them by former
Imperial Decrees, they themselves, as well as their children born after their
fathers have relinquished the administration of a public employment of this
kind, together with their own property, may enjoy the exemption; even if, in
accordance with the terms of the Constitution of the Emperor Zeno, of Divine
Memory, they should have dis-
charged, either personally or by means of substitutes, the duties imposed upon
them by the decurionate.
The above-mentioned Constitution of the Emperor Zeno, of Divine Memory, shall
remain in force from the day on which it was promulgated, as it is proper to
enact laws for future generations, and not to give rise to vexatious proceedngs
having reference to events which have already transpired.
66. The Emperor Justinian.
With a view to the interest of the members of decurionates, We decree that no
one shall flatter himself that he can be released from the performance of his
duties in any other way than that to be hereinafter specified, but he is
notified that he can only obtain exemption from the duties attached to his
condition, as decurion, in the manner which We prescribe, and that all other
methods which are not included in the present law are, from this day,
abolished. Therefore, if anyone should obtain the highest rank of the
patriciate, or the insignia of the honorary consulate, or should be raised to
that office in the ordinary course of affairs, so as to become either a consul
or a man of consular rank, or should obtain the insignia of the Praetorian
Prefecture, or the dignity of Urban Prefect, in the regular way, or should be
invested with the command of the army, let him rejoice in the knowledge that he
is freed from the condition of decurion, together with his property, and his
children which have been born after he attained the dignity, or administered
the office aforesaid, but any children born before that time shall remain in
their former condition.
All persons raised to these dignities, as well as to that of Advocates of the
Treasury, as well as those attached to the Prefectures of the Orient and
Illyria, and to the Urban Prefectures, shall, whenever they are appointed
Advocates of the Treasury, be released from the duties imposed by the
decurionate, together with their property and their children, whether the
latter were born before or after their father attained the rank aforesaid.
Those illustrious nobles who have been charged with the management of the
affairs of the Empire were also released from their curial duties by the
ancient law, and the illustrious men who discharge the functions of Imperial
Secretaries, and draw up the Imperial Epistles and Memorials, and the records
of decrees and decisions, shall be free from the obligations of the
decurionate, together with their property, and any children whom they have had
after having been promoted to the offices aforesaid. We retain this privilege
for them intact and unimpaired, in consideration of the labors which they have
performed in many ways for a long and extended period of time; hence, in
accordance with what We have previously stated, all these persons, together
with their property and their offspring, are released from the obligations of
the decurionate.
We, however, do not permit children born previously to any future Advocate of
the Treasury to be exempt from curial duties, in order to prevent others from
demanding a privilege which is not accorded
to the offspring of the highest rank, as above mentioned; but any who have been
born before their fathers obtained the office of Advocate of the Treasury shall
remain in their former condition.
With reference to other methods than those which We have specifically
enumerated, whether they were included in the ancient laws or not (as, for
instance, the case of one who was descended from three males, who was formerly
permitted to occupy a high position in the Senate), We by no means allow any of
them to be available for the purpose of securing exemption from curial duties;
no matter if a pragmatic sanction was issued on this subject, or a decision of
the Prefecture was rendered, or any other means whatever was devised; they
shall all be absolutely void, and considered as never having been of any force;
and the decurions who make use of them shall be restored to their cities, and
their property shall still remain liable, and no excuse offered by them shall,
under any circumstances, be accepted.
TITLE XXXII.
WHERE A SLAVE OK A FREEDMAN ASPIRES TO THE OFFICE OF DECURION. .
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars.
Where a freedman has not obtained the privilege of wearing a gold ring, or has
not been restored to his rights of birth, the Governor of the province shall
not permit him to take part in the affairs of the curia,but shall inflict upon
him a penalty in accordance with the severity of the law.
2. The Emperor Constantine.
If the Governor of the province should ascertain that the person who ,is
discharging the duties of sedile is your slave, and finds that he aspired to
that office without being ignorant of his status, he must inflict a suitable
punishment upon him for having defiled the dignity of the decurionate with the
stigma of slavery. If, however, he aspired to that office through mistake, for
the reason that his mother was, by public report, considered to be free, and he
himself was the son of a decurion, the Governor shall merely restore him to
your possession.
TITLE XXXIII.
THE LANDS OF DECURIONS SHALL NOT BE ALIENATED UNLESS BY VIRTUE OF A DECREE.
1. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Cyne-gius, Praetorian
Prefect.
When a decurion, compelled by necessity, desires to sell any land in the
country or in town, he should appear before a competent judge, and explain to
him in detail all the causes which force him to take this step; and he shall
only obtain authority to dispose of the property
where he can prove the necessity for the alienation of the same. The gale will
be void if this formality is neglected. This course is adopted to prevent the
vendor from wasting his property, and the purchaser, whatever his condition may
be, from being subjected to injustice. Hence the vendor cannot make any
complaint that he has either been deceived by fraud, or oppressed by the power
of the purchaser, as it will appear from the records that the necessity for the
sale existed, and that the purchaser consented to it.
If, however, anyone should, in violation of what has been prohibited, by means
of secret machinations, or through the agency of persons fraudulently
introduced, buy land anywhere from a decurion, he is hereby notified that he
will be deprived of the price that he paid, and that the land which he
purchased, together with its crops, will be returned.
Given at Constantinople, on the eighth of the Kalendsof December, during the
Consulate of Our Prince Honorius, and Evodius, 386.
2. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Florentius, Prse-torian Prefect.
No sale of hereditary property acquired by a curia,nor any release of a debtor
to the estate who made the payment, shall be permitted, unless the reason for
making the contract or for releasing the obligation shall have been examined
and approved in writing by all, or a majority of the decurions.
We order that whatever may be obtained from such a transaction shall be
expended for the purchase of land, the entire income of which (as has already
been stated) shall be carefully preserved for the public necessities of the
curia.The farmers of this revenue should be selected with the consent of all
the decurions, and especially of the more wealthy ones, and be required to
furnish proper security for the performance of their duties.
3. The Emperor Zeno.
We forbid decurions to sell any real property of any description, or any slaves
attached thereto, without first applying for a decree. They are, however,
permitted to make donations, or exchanges, or enter into any other contracts
whatsoever, as the Imperial Constitutions, which have been promulgated by
former Emperors, have stated in many places that the purchase-money is not to
be refunded, and for this reason it is clearly to be understood that a contract
of sale cannot be entered into by decurions without a decree. We further order
that when a sale takes place, a decree must be secured by the vendors (as has
already been stated) and those who buy from them will not incur any loss either
personally, or on account of the transaction, or by reason of theatrical
generosity (which is said to frequently occur). The decree issued in
confirmation of the sale should not be committed to writing, but should be
rendered by a competent judge in the presence of the decurions, or a majority
of them, without any view to the return of the property or any injury to the
contracting parties.
TITLE XXXIV.
WHEN AND To WHOM THE FOURTH PART OF THE PROPERTY
OP DECURIONS Is DUE, AND CONCERNING THE METHOD OF
DISTRIBUTING THE SAME.
1. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian.
We decree that when he who succeeds to a decurion as heir does not himself
belong to the order, whether he is an heir to the whole estate or only to a
portion of the same, or by virtue of being the possessor of the property, the
fourth part of the estate can legally be demanded from the curia.
2. The Same Emperors to Apollonius, Prsetorian Prefect.
We remember that an Imperial law was recently promulgated, by whose provisions
the fourth part of the estate of deceased decurions, whether they died testate
or intestate, passes to anyone whomsoever (with the exception of sons who are
decurions), and was referred to the body of the decurionate; but many persons
seized this opportunity to destroy the property of the entire estate by
claiming an interest in everything for themselves, so that they mutilated and
defaced all of it, and in endeavoring to secure their own rights, manifested an
inclination to injure others equally interested.
In order to take proper measures for the correction of this abuse, We do hereby
forbid decurions to seize the property of a deceased person by their own
authority. The heir, however, to whom the estate passed either as intestate, or
by a last will, directly, or under the terms of a trust, shall cause the entire
inheritance which was left to be divided into four parts, and lots shall be
cast to determine whether the curia,the heir, or beneficiary of the trust shall
have the right to select the fourth or the three-fourths of said estate
respectively, so that in this way the heirs of the deceased and the curiawill
be freed from the inconvenience of a joint and undivided ownership of the same.
It is a common fault for property jointly held to be neglected, as it is
considered that he has nothing who has not all, and hence each one suffers his
share to be deteriorated on account of the grudge which he entertains against
the others. Where, however, the fourth part of the estate of a deceased person
must be transferred to the curia,We permit the immovable property which cannot
easily be concealed, and whose production cannot injure anyone, to be appraised
and divided in the presence of the decurions. We do not, however, permit
movable property or that which is capable of moving itself, or implements, or
anything else consisting merely of a right, to be publicly produced and
divided; but We order that the statements of the heirs of the deceased (they
having been first sworn) shall be believed, when they have made a careful
estimate of the nature and value of the estate. For what is so harsh or inhuman
as, by the exhibition and display of private property, to reveal the
wretchedness of poverty, and expose wealth to envy ? In the collection of
debts, if the heirs refuse to pay the price of the fourth part of the claim to
which the decurionate is entitled, after hav-
ing publicly furnished proper security, each one shall be entitled to collect
his share from the debtors.
Likewise, on the other hand, the heirs, as well as the curia,can be compelled
to pay their proportionate shares of the indebtedness, if the deceased owed
money to anyone. When the heirs, after having been frequently notified, refuse
to take the oath, then a careful inventory of all the personal property shall
be drawn up by the members of the curia,just as in the case of real estate,
that is to say, all of the property belonging to the deceased having been
produced in public, an appraisement and division of the same shall be made in
the presence of the decurions. Moreover, We decree that in all cases where the
curiais entitled to a fourth part of the estate, any transactions concluded by
the parties in interest shall remain valid and incontrovertible.
(1) As in the case of sons, grandsons, and great-grandsons of decurions, to
whom We have decreed that estates shall descend intact, We now order that the
ownership of the same shall not be affected in the case of the daughter,
granddaughter, great-granddaughter of a chief decurion of the same city from
which her father, grandfather, or great-grandfather derived his origin, whether
she is entitled to the estate as heir at law, or under the terms of a will. If,
however, after the death of her father, she should marry, or become a widow, or
be under or over the age of puberty, We desire that those who have passed that
age or are widows shall wait for three years after their father's death, so
that, during this period, the fourth of the estate due to the curiamay remain
in suspense; or if one of them should marry a decurion of the same city, within
that time the entire estate shall vest in her permanently. But if, within the
said time, she should marry a man not belonging to the curia,or should remain
unmarried, the abovementioned portion of the entire estate, together with the
profits of the urban and rustic property, shall be adjudged to the curia,after
the. said term of three years has expired. Provided, however, that the rule
with reference to the choice of the fourth, or three-fourths of the estate, and
the oath, as well as the appraisement of the movable property and the bringing
of actions and pleading of exceptions (as has been already stated with
reference to strangers) is observed. Where the mother or grandmother of the
deceased, at the time when the son or grandson died, married a decurion of the
same city, We do not permit her to suffer the loss of the fourth part of the
estate.
Again, We release a foreign heir who was not related to the deceased, but is
attached to the city to which the latter belonged, from the loss of the fourth
part of the estate above mentioned.
Given at Constantinople, on the seventh of the Idesof March, during the
Consulate of Dioscorus and Eudoxius, 442.
3. The Emperor Justinian.
Where the member of a decurionate left but a small portion of his estate to
several of his sons or daughters, who survived him, or bequeathed it to one son
or several daughters (but still sufficient to exclude them from instituting
proceedings on the ground that the will was inofficious), and left the
remainder of his .estate to others, so that
by this distribution of the same a very small part of it was transmitted to his
child or children attached to the curia,We, for the purpose of remedying this
injustice, and that the rights of a decurion may remain unimpaired, whether any
children, grandchildren, or great-grandchildren are attached to the curia,do
hereby decree that a testator cannot transmit less than the fourth part of his
estate to his male heirs, whether there is one son or several; and that, where
there are any sisters there shall be no diminution, so far as they are
concerned, so that the curiamay not only have the benefit of their, services,
but also of their property. In addition to this, We order that if any decurion
should die, leaving several daughters, one of whom is married to a member of
the curia,and received only a small portion of the estate, the remainder having
been left to other daughters, or to strangers, the testator will not be
considered to have complied with the terms of the law of the Emperor
Theodosius, addressed to Apollonius; but on the other hand, the curiawill be
entitled to the fourth part of his estate, whether it is to be given to the
daughter who married the decurion, or is to be collected from the other heirs.
There is no doubt that the daughter who married the decurion will be exempt
from contributing any part of the fourth above mentioned, as the personal
services of a husband, performed for the benefit of the curia,render this
unnecessary.
This rule shall be observed not only where the testator, a decurion, left a
will, but also when he dies intestate. If, however, an amount less than the
fourth part of the estate of the father, or none at all, should be left, this
must by all means be given or transferred to the son, who is a decurion, or to
the daughter who married a decurion of the same city; and no objection should
be raised by the curiaif, in accordance with the law aforesaid, either the son,
grandson, great-grandson, father, grandfather, or great-grandfather, left by
the deceased decurion, should have been released from his obligations to the
curia,on account of having been raised to any dignity, or for any other reason;
as, in a case of this kind, We most certainly desire the Theodosian Law to be
disregarded.
And, generally speaking, We decree that, in every instance, neither male nor
female children belonging to the family of a decurion, who are married, shall
receive less than the fourth part of the estate of their father. And, when
there are no sons or daughters, or other heirs, the curiaitself shall, in
accordance with the terms of former laws, be entitled to the fourth part of the
estate of the decurion, as a consolation for his loss.
TITLE XXXV.
CONCERNING THE CLAIM OF A CURIA TO PROPERTY WHICH HAS BEEN GRATUITOUSLY
TRANSFERRED.
1. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Apollonius, Prse-torian Prefect.
We order that the penalty of four siliquseshall only be collected in the case
of the gratuitous transfer of real property, and not for that
of slaves or animals, or any other chattels, and if the parties are not
decurions We release them from liability, where ancestors make a transfer to
their descendants, so that if a father, grandfather, or greatgrandfather,
either by his last will, or by a donation inter vivos,should transfer any of
his estate to his son, grandson, great-grandson, or his daughter,
granddaughter, or great-granddaughter, and it makes no difference whether they
are married to decurions or not), it shall not be subject to the imposition of
the penalty aforesaid.
Likewise, on the other hand, where descendants convey property belonging to
them to their ascendants, who are connected with them by ties of blood,
liberality of this kind shall not be charged with any burden, for a natural
debt is discharged under the designation of generosity, where a transaction
like this takes place between persons nearly related to one another.
We also order that the authority of this law shall be enforced when, in case of
intestacy, heirs in the degrees above designated succeed to an estate. In
successions of this kind the transaction is rather the payment of a debt than
the tender of a gift, as the transfer is made rather on account of relationship
than from motives of generosity. Other persons, however, even though they may
be united by ties of blood, shall never be entitled to enjoy property belonging
to a decurion without payment of the above-mentioned imposition, unless he who
obtained the property gratuitously is a member of the decurionate of the same
city, and who, although he is classed as a stranger, is released from the
payment of the tax on the property given to him; for as long as the condition
of the person remains the same, that of the property should not be altered.
We desire that a transfer of property should only be called gratuitous, and be
exempt from the burden aforesaid, when it comes into the hands of anyone by
inheritance, as a legacy, a bequest subject to a trust, a donation causa
mortis,or is acquired under the terms of a will by any person whomsoever. A
donation inter vivos,which is gratuitously bestowed, deserves this name, and is
subject to the penalty. Where, however, a future father-in-law makes a donation
in consideration of his prospective relationship by marriage to the betrothed
of his son, grandson, or great-grandson; or her father should endow his
daughter, granddaughter, or great-granddaughter, whether she was about to marry
a decurion or a stranger, even though it may have been agreed that, in case of
death or divorce, the property which was given as dowry should belong to the
person who received it, it shall not be classed as gratuitous, or be subject to
the penalty; for it is not sanctioned by law that marriage, which is surrounded
with so many and such great difficulties, should be loaded down with additional
burdens. Moreover, the property which, in the cases above mentioned, has once
obtained the name of being gratuitously bestowed, even though it may have been
transferred by him or her who received it to someone else either under the
terms of a sale, or of any other kind of contract, is undoubtedly conveyed
subject to the above-mentioned penalty; so that the person who knowingly
received it encumbered in this manner will
have only himself to blame; or, if he accepted it ignorantly, he will be
entitled to recover any damages which he may have sustained.
On the other hand, if an agreement of any kind was not, in the beginning, to be
classed as a gratuitous transaction, and the title to the property should
afterwards vest in anyone under a lucrative title, it will not be subject to
the above-mentioned imposition; for in such cases there is no occasion for
merger, even though the latter title may be based on the former one, unless
what came into his hands in the course of trade belonged to a decurion, and was
transferred to another either under the terms of a last will through an
intestate succession, or by virtue of a donation inter vivos;for then, because
it once belonged to a decurion, it will acquire the condition and be subject to
the penalty of property gratuitously conveyed, without reference to any prior
title.
Given at Constantinople, on the seventh of the Idesof March, during the fifth
Consulate of Dioscorus and Eudoxius, 422.
TITLE XXXVI.
CONCERNING THE PAYMENT OF SALARIES.
1. The Emperor Constantine to Marcellimis, Governor.
A salary shall not be paid to anyone out of funds belonging to the State,
unless he has been especially authorized by Us to receive it.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifth of the Nonesof October, during the
Consulate of Liminius and Catullinus, 349.
TITLE XXXVII.
WHERE A DECURION, HAVING LEFT THE CITY, PREFERS TO RESIDE IN THE COUNTRY.
1. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Eutychiamis, Prx-torian Prefect.
We order that all decurions shall hereby be warned not to leave or abandon
their cities for the purpose of residing in the country, and they are notified
that the land which they preferred to the city shall be confiscated to the
Treasury, and that they will lose the property on account of which they have
manifested such a neglect of duty by evading their civil obligations.
Given at Constantinople, on the eighteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the
Consulate of Arcadius, Consul for the fourth time, and Honorius, Consul for the
third time, 396.
TITLE XXXVIII.
CONCERNING THE CITIZENS OF TOWNS AND NATIVES. 1. The Emperor Alexander.
As you allege that you are a native of Byblius, and a citizen of Berytus, it is
but reasonable that you should be compelled to perform your municipal duties in
both cities.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Frontonus.
If (as you state) she who manumitted you under the terms of a trust, and from
whom you obtained your lawful freedom, derived her origin from the province of
Aquitania, you also are of the same status, and a citizen of the same city as
she who manumitted you, for it was long since decided that persons who have
been manumitted under a trust follow the condition of those who actually gave
them their liberty, and not that of those who requested that it be granted.
3. The Emperor Philip.
It is a well-established rule of law that sons can be compelled to accept
offices and discharge civil duties, not in the city where their mother derived
her origin (provided they have not retained their domicile there), even though
they themselves may have been born there, but in the city of their father's
birth.
4. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian.
It is clear that no one can, merely by his own will, renounce his origin.
5. The Emperor Constantine to Maximm, Vicegerent of the East.
Where anyone who is a native of a large or small town desires to leave it, and
become the resident of another, and attempts to offer a petition to Us praying
for permission to do so, or is guilty of any other fraud in order to avoid the
duties he owes to his own city, he shall be subject-to the burdens of the
decurionate in both the cities aforesaid; in one, on account of his choice, and
in the other, on account of his
origin.
Published on the eighth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Paulinus and Julian, 325.
TITLE XXXIX.
CONCERNING RESIDENTS, AND WHERE ANYONE Is CONSIDERED TO HAVE His DOMICILE, AND
CONCERNING THOSE WHO RESIDE IN OTHER CITIES FOR THE PURPOSE OF PURSUING THEIR
STUDIES.
1. The Emperor Antoninus.
No objection can be urged against you if, being the resident of a city, you
have undertaken some public charge, provided that you have transferred your
domicile before being called to accept another office.
2. The Emperor Alexander.
Those who reside anywhere for the purpose of pursuing their studies are not
considered to have established their domicile in that place, unless they remain
there longer than ten years. According to an Epistle of the Divine Hadrian, a
father who frequently visits his
son, while the latter is pursuing his studies, cannot be considered to have
established his residence in the town where the latter is sojourning. If,
however, he can be proved in other ways to have his domicile in the magnificent
City of Laodicea, the falsehood by which he attempts to avoid the discharge of
his municipal duties will be of no advantage to him.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian.
It is true that those who do not live in any city,- but in the territory
subject to the jurisdiction of the same, will not, as residents, be required to
perform civil duties, or accept municipal offices.
4. The Same Emperors and Cassars.
As you state that you are either natives or inhabitants of the city in
question, the authority of public law does not compel you to perform municipal
functions, merely because you own a house or land therein, even though the said
property may have been acquired from the estate of a decurion.
5. The Same Emperors and Caesars.
If you have fixed your domicile in the country of your wife, or in any other
place whatsoever, you will, as a resident thereof, be legally obliged
voluntarily to discharge the municipal duties attaching to the same.
6. The Same Emperors and Cassars to MarceUinus.
It is perfectly certain that where a special privilege with reference to a city
does not exist, anyone can be compelled to perform municipal duties either by
reason of his birth, or through his voluntary establishment of a domicile.
7. The Same Emperors and Cassars.
Birth, manumission, a call to public office, or adoption renders a man a
citizen, but his domicile makes him a resident, as the Divine Hadrian clearly
stated in his Edict. There is no doubt that individuals have their domicile
where they have placed their household goods and the greater part of their
property and fortunes, and no one shall depart from thence unless something
requires him to do so, and whenever he does leave the place, he is considered
to be on a journey, and when he returns, to have completed it.
8. The Emperor Constantine.
Senators are considered to have their domicile in the Imperial City where they
enjoy the honors attaching to their position.
9. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens.
We raise women to the dignity of their husbands, render them noble by birth,
and establish jurisdiction over them, in accordance with their personal rank.
If they should subsequently marry men of inferior
station, having lost the rank of their first husbands, they will follow the
condition of the second, and also change their domiciles.
Given at Constantinople, on the fourth of the Kalendsof February, during the
Consulate of Arcadius, Consul for the second time, and Rufinus, 392.
TITLE XL.
CONCERNING THE NON-TRANSMISSION OP MUNICIPAL
DUTIES AND HONORS FROM FATHER TO SON, AND THE
INTERVALS WHICH EXIST.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus.
Just as municipal honors and offices cannot be continued in the same household,
when both father and son are decurions, so the times when these are vacant can
be of no benefit to others than those who are called to the same or other
offices, or who are bound to discharge the same or other duties. Moreover, with
reference to your son, who is an infant, and whom you desire to be a decurion,
although you may have pledged your faith for him hereafter, still, you yourself
cannot be compelled to perform the duties which would be exacted of him, as you
appear to have given your consent only to what he can be ordered to do.
2. The Emperor Gordian.
An interval of five years after the relinquishment of the duties of an office
must elapse before the same can again be resumed, and where different offices
are involved, the term of three years is required. To those who have been
employed on an embassy, the term of two years is granted.
3. The Same Emperor.
It has frequently been decided that the intervals of time which apply to one
person do not, by any means, apply to brothers, even though they may hold
property in common. Still, if the Governor of the province should find that you
have discharged your civil duties with fidelity, those shall be appointed who
have not yet performed their own, and are competent to do so, in order that you
may not again be called upon to discharge them.
TITLE XLI. CONCERNING CHARGES UPON ESTATES.
1. The Emperor Antoninus.
Civil functions must be performed in regular order, in proportion to the means
of the parties concerned.
2. The Same Emperor.
Civil duties which are imposed upon estates for the public welfare must be
discharged by all persons.
3. The Emperor Alexander.
Those who have obtained exemption from public office must still discharge the
duties imposed upon estates, among which is that of entertaining guests.
4. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus.
It does not seem to be contrary to the spirit of the decision by which the
Governor of the province decreed that the horses belonging to the decurionate
must be supported, to hold that this is not a personal, but a patrimonial
obligation; still, if it should be unjust, and you fail to appeal, the
obligation will remain unaltered.
5. The Emperors Cams, Carvnus, and Numerianus.No one can plead his age, or the
number of his children, by way of excuse from charges imposed upon his
patrimony.
6. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian.
A discrepancy exists between your admission and your claim, for you say that
you are a philosopher, and you have been conquered by avarice and rapacity, and
you alone venture to refuse the performance of the duties imposed upon your
patrimony. You can learn from the example of others that your attempt will be
fruitless.
1. The Same Emperors and Csesars.
Even minors are ordinarily subject to patrimonial charges. Therefore, you will
understand that it is in vain that you desire complete immunity, as it is
necessary for you to perform those duties which involve the expenditure of
money.
8. The Emperor Constantine.
The functions of the protostasiat,the priesthood, and the decapro-tiatare not
corporeal ones, and there is no doubt that they are solely patrimonial.
9. The Emperor Valentinian and Valens.
Women, also, are liable to charges imposed upon estates.
10. The Same Emperors and Gratian.
We have notified the Governors of provinces to inform all possessors of
property, and the other persons designated, of the amount of the extraordinary
assessment which they will be expected to pay. These have been included among
patrimonial charges, in order that they may be known to everyone, and the
public necessities be the more readily provided for.
TITLE XLII. IN WHAT WAY CIVIL OBLIGATIONS ARE DIVIDED.
1. The Emperor Alexander.
If, as you state, you have appealed from the decree by which you were
appointed Superintendent of Couriers, and the Governor of the
province should ascertain that you are a member of another curia,he will not
permit you to be forced to perform the duties attaching to it, for the reason
that you should only be liable to perform those of the one to which you say you
belong.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian.
It is reasonable that persons who have been promoted to a higher office should
not be compelled to perform the duties of a lower one.
3. The Same Emperors.
As you assert that you have performed all the duties required of you, the
Governor of the province will see that you are not compelled to perform the
same ones a second time, if there is a sufficient number of citizens qualified
to do so.
4. The Same Emperors and Csesars.
The Governor of the province will not suffer you to be unreasonably oppressed
by the performance of civil duties from which others have been released; but,
being mindful of the law, as well as apprehensive of censure, he will see that
equality is preserved, and appointments made in their regular order.
TITLE XLIII.
CONCERNING THOSE WHO VOLUNTARILY ASSUME THE DISCHARGE OP PUBLIC DUTIES.
1. The Emperor Antoninm.
Veterans who, while they are able to avoid the discharge of civil duties
through the immunity granted them, prefer to be made de-curions in their native
country, cannot avail themselves of the excuse which they have once
relinquished, unless they have given their consent conditionally under an
agreement that they shall be entitled to exemption, or if they have only
consented to discharge a part of the duties of the employment.
2. The Emperor Alexander.
Where anyone who is exempt from the requirements of public office has
voluntarily accepted any position, except the decurionate, he shall not lose
the privilege to which he is entitled, although he may not for a short time
have availed himself of it, for the reason that he wished to be useful to his
country, or was induced by the hope of distinction.
3. The Emperor Leo.
He who, while not a member of the decurionate, has voluntarily exercised the
functions of a municipal office or employment in any city whatsoever, shall
not, in any way, be prejudiced with reference to his fortune or his status, but
he himself, as well as his children and their descendants, shall, together with
their property, remain free from every obligation of this kind, so that if the
performance of any duty should be enjoined upon them, with their consent, for
which reason it
was necessary for them to receive anything, and they refund the money which is
proved to have been paid, they can depart without any anxiety or fear with
reference to their status.
Moreover, when anyone of such persons voluntarily discharges all the duties or
functions of a decurion, or accepts the honors of the office without being
required to do so, We decree by this law that, on account of his generosity, he
shall be appointed a father of the city of which he voluntarily became a
citizen, if he should wish this to be done.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof November, during the Consulate of Basilicus
and Armericus, 465.
4. The Emperor Justinian.
When persons who are free from the obligations of the decurionate afterwards
join that order in any city, We desire that their children not only those
which have already been born, but any which may be born after their voluntary
union with the decurionateshall remain free from its obligations, whether
their fathers joined the decurionate under the express condition that their
descendants should remain exempt from its duties, or whether they made no
mention whatever of this; and let no one venture to assert that they follow the
condition of their father for the reason that they were born or conceived after
his enrollment in the decurionate.
We hasten to establish this special privilege, in order that all persons may be
the more ready to contribute their aid to bodies of this kind. In order that
none of the heirs of such a decurion may suffer any uneasiness, We also decree
that his property shall be exempt from all charges of the decurionate; and if
any property of the deceased derived from the administration of the functions
of the office, or from the fourth part of his estate, should be proved to be
due to the same curiafor any other reason, his heirs shall entertain no doubt
that it must be transferred to that body.
Again, natural children whom their father gave, or might subsequently give to
the curiaunder the condition that he would have them as his lawful heirs, not
only under his will, but also in case of intestacy, are exempted from the
operation of the present law; and they shall not only be excepted in accordance
with the ancient enactments, but also under the present one, by Our express
order; so that the natural children themselves, together with all males
begotten by them, shall follow the condition of their father; or, in case there
should be no surviving male children, the fourth part of the estate of the
deceased shall pass to the decurionate.
TITLE XLIV.
CONCERNING THOSE WHO HAVE OBTAINED TEMPORARY EXEMPTION FROM THE DUTIES OF A
DECURIONATE.
1. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian.
No one shall be entitled to temporary exemption from the duties of a
decurionate unless, for good and sufficient reasons, a permit to that effect
has been granted by Us.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Nonesof June, during the
Consulate of Theodosius, Consul for the third time, and Abun-dantius, 390.
TITLE XLV.
CONCERNING EXEMPTION FROM OFFICIAL DUTIES. 1. The Emperor Gordian.
It has very recently been decided that exemption from public duties only
applies to those which have not been imposed by any law, Decree of the Senate,
or Imperial Constitution. In accordance with this legal rule, if you should be
summoned by the magistrates to the performance of extraordinary duties, and
appeal to the Governor, you can be protected by law.
TITLE XLVI.
CONCERNING THE DECREES OF DECURIONS HAVING
REFERENCE TO IMMUNITY GRANTED TO CERTAIN
OF THEIR COLLEAGUES.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian.
Immunity from public service cannot be granted by decurions to any of their
colleagues, with the exception of such as are instructors iinnliberal studies, or
are practicing the healing art.
2. The Same Emperors and C&sars.
Unwarranted decrees issued by the Order of Decurions are reprobated by the
Imperial Constitutions.
TITLE XLVII.
CONCERNING EXCUSES FROM THE DISCHARGE OF PUBLIC
DUTIES.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars.
^Those who are employed as Our attorneys are required to perform civil
functions which are suitable to their dignity.
_ 2. Extracts from the Acts of the Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the
Csesars.
._ The Emperor Diocletian spoke, as follows, to Firminus, Apollina-rius, and
the other Chief Decurions of the City of Antioch, who were present: "Exemption
from civil and personal functions has been granted to certain officials, that
is to say, protectors and commanders, and therefore persons of this kind shall
not be called to discharge either personal or civil duties."
3. The Same Emperors and Csesars.
Responsibility for guardianship does not excuse anyone from the discharge of
civil duties, nor will three guardianships of different households, imposed at
the same time, confer a benefit of this kind.
4. The Same Emperors and Caesars.
Performers on hydraulic organs cannot prove that exemption from civil duties is
granted them by law.
5. The Same Emperors and Csesars.
The agents of persons absent on business for the State are not exempt from the
performance of civil duties.
6. The Same Emperors and Ciesars to Gaius.
Immunity on account of their profession alone cannot be established to have
been granted to hunters by any law.
7. The Emperor Constantine.
In accordance with an ancient constitution, it appears that merchants, tailors,
linen-weavers, dyers of purple, and parthiarii,who furnish Us with clothing,
are exempt from all civil duties.
8. The Same Emperor to Taurus, Prsetorian Prefect.
It is decreed that no judge shall, hereafter, under any circumstances, place a
charge on the inhabitants of any province, but magistrates must sedulously
exercise supervision over all those which have been established under the-name
of tax, or have been imposed by Us directly or indirectly, or by virtue of
Epistles. When, however, any urgent necessity for this exists, We decree that
the question shall be referred to Your Highness and that you will become
responsible; and while the levy may be made provisionally, it should be brought
to Our knowledge, in order that it may be confirmed by Our order.
If anyone should, by a rash usurpation of power, attempt to violate this law,
he shall be liable to quadruple restitution. This severity ought to strike
terror into ordinary judges and their subordinates, and if any of them should
either with connivance, induced by favor, or through base dissimulation,
encourage the audacity of a decurion, they shall be punished with the penalty
of simple damages.
Given at Constantinople, on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof April, during the
Consulate of Valentinian and Valens, 354.
9. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens.
Precautions must be taken to prevent anyone from thinking that this, which is a
personal function, can be discharged by the payment of money.
10. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Hypa-tius, Prietorian
Prefect.
The privileges attaching to Our private property remaining in full force, all
lands which are rented by perpetual lease shall not be sub-
jected to any extraordinary contributions, nor shall the original rental be
increased, and lessees of this kind are exempt from any general impositions
authorized by Us, and must not be classed with others who, besides their
ordinary burdens, pay Us a certain fixed rent based upon the value of the land
which they occupy.
Published at Carthage, during the Idesof April, after the Consulate of Syagrius
and Eucherius, 382.
11. The Same Emperors to Syagrius, Prsetorian Prefect.
We order that those who, having been invested with the dignity of Count, have,
either by means of letters or petitions, been proposed to Us as eligible to the
appointment of masters, as well as those who have performed their duties to Us
by drafting and signing opinions, shall be exempt from all civil duties.
Therefore, persons who have been attached to Our palace, and are of this rank,
shall receive the privileges to which they are entitled, and those also, who
have attained to higher dignities, shall rejoice in the enjoyment of the same
privileges.
Read at Capua, on the third of the Kalendsof September, during
the Consulate of Antoninus and Syagrius, 382.
12. The Same Emperors to Hypatius, Prsetorian Prefect.
The greatest dignitaries of the State, the Counts of the Consistory, Our
notaries, Our valets de chambre,and the guards of Our bedchamber, shall all be
exempt from ignoble services. Others who enjoy palatine or military privileges
within the precincts of the palace shall, likewise, have the same advantage, if
they can show that they are entitled to an exemption of this kind by former
laws, not as having been granted to them individually, but to have been
conferred upon the whole order or body of which they are members. The same
privilege conceded by ancient custom shall continue to be enjoyed by
rhetoricians and grammarians of both languages.
Exemption from ignoble services signifies that persons of superior rank shall
not be required to grind fine flour, bake bread, or perform any of the duties
of a baker, as well as the labors imposed upon menials having charge of
vehicles or post-horses, with the exception of those which, in accordance with
custom, are performed on the frontier of Rhetia, or which the necessities of
the expedition to Illyria may require.
No services shall be demanded of persons of this kind for the aid of certain
classes of laborers, for instance, in the burning of lime. Nor shall the
estates of those who are exempt be compelled to supply building material of
timber or planks. The furnishing of charcoal, also, except where, in accordance
with ancient custom, it is required for the coining of money, or the
manufacture of arms, shall not be exacted of persons of this description. Nor
shall they be obliged to provide anything for the construction or repair of
public or sacred buildings.
Property protected by such privileges, which belongs to ambassadors and members
of colleges, is not liable to these impositions.
This advantage, however, can only be enjoyed by estates which are considered to
possess the dignity in their own name. By a grant of general privilege We also
exempt from the rendition of ignoble services those who have already been
invested with similar honors.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof December, during the Consulate of Antonius and
Syagrius, 382.
13. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Neo-therius,
Prsetorian Prefect.
The exemption from ignoble labors granted to persons cannot pass to their heirs
or successors, for it is not perpetual, and We have conceded it not to things
but to persons, in consideration of their rank or military service.
Given at Milan, on the eighteenth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of
Arcadius and Bauto, 385.
14. The Same Emperors to Tatian, Prsetorian Prefect of the East.
We decree that the law by which certain dignitaries have been expressly
exempted from extraordinary and ignoble services, shall, without doubt, apply
to those who have been honored by Us, so that they may enjoy the same
privilege, not merely while they are in office but as long as they live.
Given at Milan, on the eleventh of the Kalends ofApril, during the Consulate of
Tatian and Symmachus, 391.
15. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Messianus, Count of Private Affairs.
We decree clearly and absolutely that there shall not be imposed upon any land
forming part of Our private domain, which is held under a lease, or by
emphyteusis, any ignoble charge or imposition, under the name of a tax, except
the ordinary ones, for this has been ordered by the Emperors, our predecessors,
and confirmed by Us. Therefore, any judge who violates this law is hereby
notified that he will be compelled to pay a fine of five pounds of gold out of
his own property, and that his subordinates and the decurions who have executed
his illegal commands will be fined an equal sum.
Given at Milan, on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate
of Olybrius and Probinus, 395.
16. The Same Emperors and Theodosius to Melitius, Prsetorian Prefect.
We hereby release all illustrious persons from ignoble services, and the losses
resulting from extraordinary impositions.
Given at Ravenna, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate
of Honorius, Consul for the ninth time, and Theodosius, Consul for- the fifth
time, 412.
TITLE XLVIII.
CONCERNING CHARGES AND SERVICES FROM WHICH No ONE CAN BE EXCUSED.
1. The Emperor Aurelian.
All persons, without exception, are required to sell to the Government any
commodities which they may have, in order to provide for the maintenance and
transport of the armies in Illyria; since, with reference to this matter, We
decree that no one shall be entitled to avail himself of any privilege
whatsoever, but, when circumstances demand it, all will be compelled to
contribute, not only those who are wealthy, but everyone from the highest to
the lowest, in proportion to his possessions, shall be subject to this
obligation.
2. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Taurus, Prsetorian Prefect.
As Our subjects in all the provinces should render Us ordinary service in the
places through which We travel, We order that no one shall be exempt from any
services connected with the furnishing of post-horses, transportation, or
vehicles, which We may require at such times, but that no persons, whether they
are attached to the retinue of the Emperor or the Empress, or to the Holy
Church, or to any other illustrious house, shall be released by any law,
Imperial decree, or rescript; and We order that they must obey any proclamation
of Your Excellency issued during the time of Our journey.
3. The Emperor Leo.
We order, by this most wise law, that no excuse shall avail, and that no
personal rank shall be exempt, but when the construction of walls, the
contribution of grain or any other commodities may be required in any place
subject to your jurisdiction, these shall be furnished without any hesitation,
so far as Your Highness may consider it to be proper and necessary.
TITLE XLIX.
WHO ARE EXCUSED BY REASON OF THEIR AGE OR PROFESSION.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian.
As you allege that you are engaged in liberal studies, and especially such as
have reference to the profession of the law, and are at present residing in the
City of Berytus, in the province of Phoenicia, We, in consideration of the
public welfare and your expectations, hereby decree that neither of you shall
be interfered with while pursuing your studies, until you have reached the age
of twenty-five years.
2. The Same Emperors and Caesars.
As you allege that although your sons have been released from your control they
are still minors, it is with reason that you request
that they should not be molested while pursuing their studies. Hence We direct
that they shall not be liable to personal charges having no connection with
estates in which they are interested, if no lack of other citizens exists.
3. The Same Emperors and Csesars.
It is a clear rule of law that persons more than fifty-five years of age cannot
be compelled to perform personal services. Therefore, as you state that you are
over seventy, if you appealed on account of your appointment, you can, in
accordance with law, be protected by the Governor of the province.
TITLE L. WHO ARE EXCUSED ON ACCOUNT OF DISEASE.
1. The Emperor Gordian.
If your father, having lost his sight in battle, is blind in both eyes, he will
be released from all personal charges.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian.
As you allege that you are deaf, you will be exempt from personal charges by
authority of the public law.
3. The Same Emperors and Csssars.
The gout does not afford a valid excuse from personal services, but as you say
that you are so afflicted with disease in the feet that you cannot attend to
your own affairs, the Governor of the province will not permit you to be
subjected to personal charges, if he should find that your statements are true.
4. The Same Emperors and Ciesars.
The bodily infirmities of a father do not afford a valid excuse for releasing
his son from personal charges.

TITLE LI.
CONCERNING THOSE WHO SHOULD BE EXCUSED ON
ACCOUNT OF THE NUMBER OF THEIR CHILDREN, OR
BY REASON OF THEIR POVERTY.
1. The Emperor Antoninus.
The number of children does not exempt anyone from the burdens of a public
office.
2. The Emperor Philip and the Csesar Philip.
It has already been decided that, where a son has been captured by the enemy
and has not yet returned, this fact cannot be advanced by his father to excuse
him from personal services.
3. The Same Emperors and Caesars.

Grandsons who succeed to their father confer the same benefits as the latter
would have done, and therefore if he who you say is your father has under his
control five grandchildren of sons whom he has lost, he should be excused from
personal services in conformity with the laws.
4. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian.
As you state that you have transferred all your property to your son, and have
retained nothing, you will be required to perform civil services on account of
property which has ceased to belong to you.
5. The Same Emperors and Caesars.
Where women, on account of their sex, are liable to personal services, the
Divine Emperors, Our relatives, have decided that they shall be excused, just
as males are, when they have five surviving children.
6. The Emperor Constantine to Dalmatius.
It is established that parents who have five children of either sex shall be
exempt from personal services, but if among this number a son of lawful age
should be found, he will immediately become subject to the performance of the
services to which his father was liable. The exemption afforded by the laws
shall, however, be granted to fathers who have five sons or daughters. If
anyone should deserve exemption on account of being weak-minded, and this can
be proved, he will enjoy this privilege; just as he could do if, when required
to perform personal services, he had been declared exempt' on account of
poverty.
Given at Sirmium, on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof February, during the
Consulate of Crispus, Consul for the third time, and Constantine, Consul for
the second time, 324.1
TITLE LII. CONCERNING PROFESSORS AND PHYSICIANS.
1. The Emperor Antoninus.
If, as you allege you are serving as the physician of the Second Legion, you
cannot be compelled to perform civil services as long as you are absent on
business for the State. After your connection with
1 The Roman system of taxation was quite complicated, and its exactions at
times somewhat severe. Its most oppressive characteristics were its unequal
distribution and its uncertainty, the levy usually varying according to the
present exigencies of the State, and was, to a great extent, dependent upon the
caprice of the authorities charged with its imposition. The practice of farming
out the collection of taxes was, as is ever the case, a perpetual cause of
corruption and annoyance. No available source of public revenue seems to have
escaped the ingenuity and vigilance of the Roman legislator. Assessments, often
arbitrary, were placed upon conquered nations, lands, personal property,
individuals, incomes, and inheritances. Duties were imposed upon almost all
imports and exports.
The earliest species of tax was the tributumso called from the tribus,or
plebeians, who were at first the sole subject of itand while, strictly
speaking,
the army has ceased, however(<and you have returned, you will be entitled to
exemption, if you are'included in the number of those physicians to whom this
privilege has been granted.
2. The Emperor Gordian.
It is a well-known fact that grammarians or orators, who have been authorized
by a decree of a curia,can be deprived of their privi-
it was not a land-tax, real property, then almost exclusively in the hands of
the populace, was its foundation, and was principally affected by it. The
patricians subsequently became liable to this enforced and indeterminate
contribution. The tributum,was levied for the maintenance and remuneration of
the army, and for the purposes of national defense, of which the erection and
repair of fortifications constituted an important and essential item. In early
times, the money collected from the taxpayers was refunded to them out of the
proceeds of the sale of the booty obtained in war. The rate of the tributumwas
at first one part in a thousand of the value of the property, which was
afterwards increased to three thousandths.
Although ordinarily uncertain in amount, the term tributumwas also applicable
to the charge on land and the poll-tax, both of which were definite and
established.
The stipendiumwas the contribution exacted from countries reduced to subjection
by the Roman arms, and was payable in cash, or in commodities of every
description. In the early days of the Empire, a systematic valuation of land
and personal property was instituted, with a view to the levy of this tax, a
measure which had not hitherto been adopted, and which greatly facilitated its
distribution and collection. Some provinces were annually assessed a specified
sum; others were only required to contribute a certain percentage of the crops
of land capable of tillage. This want of uniformity was largely due to the
retention of ancient customs observed prior to the Roman domination.
Among the most lucrative sources of national revenue was the portorium,or
harbor-tax, which included levies of both imports and exports, and dated back
to the foundation of the Roman state. Custom-houses were maintained at the
borders of every province, as well as at those of the Empire. Personal effects
for the use of the owner were, with the exception of articles of undoubted
luxury, exempt from import duties. The amount of the latter varied, at
different epochs, from two and a half to twelve and a half percent of the
appraised value of the goods.
All estates estimated at more than 100,000 sesterces(about $300.00$) were taxed
five per cent. Persons, regardless of sex, who owned no land, were, after their
twenty-fifth year, liable to a poll-tax, the amount of which was established by
a decree of the Emperor; males being generally obliged to pay twice as much as
females. Four per cent of the purchase-money of every slave sold was collected,
as well as five per cent of that of everyone manumitted.
The publicani,or farmers of the revenue, were exclusively entrusted with the
collection of certain taxes, which duty was not imposed upon government
officials. They were originally taken from the Equestrian Order, employment of
this kind being considered derogatory to the dignity of a senator, and were
required to give security for the return of the sums due to the government. As
they purchased the right to collect the revenue of entire districts and
provinces, the temptation to abuse their privilege was irresistible, and the
term publicanussoon became synonymous with extortion. Their wealth and
influence were enormous, and the business was so extensive and profitable that
corporations were organized for the purpose of conducting it, which paid almost
incredible dividends to the stockholders. Contracts were awarded by the censors
to the highest bidder at public sale, and ran from one to five years. The
infamous rapacity and heartlessness of these gentry, who had every incentive to
wring the last sestercefrom the unfortunate taxpayer, was proverbial, and is
frequently reprobated by ancient writers: "Ubi publicanus, est ibi aut jus
publicum vannum, aut libertas sociis nulla."(Livy, AnnalesXLV, 18.)ED.

3. The Emperor Philip.
Poets do not enjoy any privilege of immunity.
4. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Cazsars.By an address of the
Divine Pius, professors of the liberal studies, but not accountants, are
included among those who are exempt.
5. The Same Emperors and Csesars.
It has been frequently decided that physicians shall not be included among
those not liable to civil duties, against the will of the curia,as immunity
must be granted them by a decree of the decurions.
6. The Emperor Constantine to Volusianus.
We order that physicians, archiatri*grammarians, and other professors of
letters, as well as doctors of the law, together with their wives and children,
and any property which they may possess in their own cities, shall be exempt
from every function, and every kind of service, civil as well as public; and
shall not be required to entertain guests in a province; nor perform any labor;
nor be compelled to appear in court; nor be deprived of their property; nor be
produced before any tribunal; nor suffer any injury; and if anyone should
molest them, he shall be punished as the judge may decide.
We order that rewards and salaries shall be paid to them by which they may the
more readily perfect themselves in their liberal studies and arts above
mentioned.
Published at Sirmium, on the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Crispus
and Constantine, 321.
7. The Emperor Julian.
Masters and doctors of the liberal arts should, first of all, excel in
morality, and next in eloquence. But as I, Myself, cannot be present in the
different cities, I order that anyone who wishes to teach shall not suddenly or
rashly adopt this profession, but must not do so until
1 These were medical practitioners whose superior talents and established
reputation had raised them to a commanding place in their profession. Their
origin dated back to the reign of the Csesars. Much uncertainty exists as to
their prerogatives, but it is known that they exercised supervision and, to
some extent at least, were invested with judicial authority over other
physicians. They were divided into two classes, from one of which were selected
the medical attendants of the imperial family, and to the other were assigned
the care and treatment of the poor. A certain number of the latter, which
varied according to the population and importance of the community, was
allotted to each municipality; the smallest provincial town had five, at Rome
there were sixteen. As they received regular salaries from the government, the
archiatriwere obliged to give their services gratuitously to indigent patients,
but were not prohibited from accepting compensation from persons able to pay.
Their remuneration was, as a rule, greater than that of the Court physicians,
whose exalted rank and special privileges were presumed to make up for any
deficiency of fees.ED.
he has been accepted by the Order of Decurions, and formally authorized by them
under a decree, with the consent of the principal citizens of the community.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof July, and adopted at Spoletium, on the
fourth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Ma-mertinus and
Nevitta, 362.
8. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Probus, Prastorian Prefect.
Every person who is known to have improperly and insolently adopted the
profession of philosopher shall be sent back to his country, with the exception
of those who, having been approved by the principal citizens of the town,
should be separated from the above-mentioned class. For it is shameful that he
who professes to be able to endure the reverses of fortune can not discharge
the duties which he owes to his country.
Given at Sirmium, on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof February, during the
Consulate of Valentinian and Victor, 370.
9. The Same Emperors to Prsetextatus, Prefect of the City.
The attention of archiatersis called to the fact that, when contributions are
made to them by the people, it is more honorable to aid the poor rather than to
basely minister to the rich. We permit them to receive only what those whom
they have cured offer for their services, and not what the latter, when in
danger, may have promised for restitution to health.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof February, during the third Consulate of
Valentinian and Valens, 370.
10. The Same Emperors to Olybrius, Prsetorian Prefect.
When any physician, who is deserving of promotion, is a candidate for the place
of a deceased archmter,he shall not obtain it before he is pronounced to be
qualified by seven or more of the principal practitioners to be found in the
profession; and, moreover, anyone who is admitted shall not at once be placed
in the first rank, but shall take his turn and be the last in order, following
those who have preceded him.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof March, during the third Consulate of
Valentinian and Valens, 370.
11. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Monachius, Prse-torian Prefect.
We order that grammarians, orators, and teachers of philosophy, as well as
physicians, who, by the authority of previous laws which have been enacted,
have obtained privileges and immunities, shall enjoy these privileges; and that
all the physicians attached to the Imperial palace, whether they have attained
to the rank of count of the first or second grade, or some more exalted
dignity, shall not be molested by the officers of any municipality, or
decurionate, whether they
have ceased to perform, or have just begun to perform their functions, if they
have obtained an honorable discharge; and they shall be exempt from all public
employments and duties, hence their families, wherever situated, shall not be
compelled to entertain either sdldiers
or judges.
We order that these rules shall apply, without exception, to their children and
their wives. We also direct that the professors above mentioned, as well as
their children, shall enjoy the same immunity.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Kalendsof December, during the
Consulate of Constantius and Constans, 374.
TITLE LIII. CONCERNING ATHLETES.
1. The Emperor Alexander.
It is the custom to exempt from civil duties those athletes who are proved to
have won not less than three crowns in formal contests during their entire
lives (one of which must have been obtained at Rome, or in ancient Greece), and
who have not been defeated, and deprived of their crowns by their competitors.
TITLE LIV.
CONCERNING THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN DISCHARGED FROM THE ARMY BEFORE COMPLETING THEIR
TERM OF SERVICE.
1. The Emperor Antoninus.
Soldiers who have been dishonorably discharged must not become candidates for
honorable office, but should not be excluded from the discharge of civil
duties.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian.
As you have been dismissed from the army on account of your advanced age, there
.can be no doubt that your discharge was honorable, and therefore you will be
exempt from civil duties, but not from honorable dignities. Still, the law
permits you to avail yourself of those privileges to which all are entitled who
have completed their full term of military service, for you yourself
acknowledge that you were discharged before having served the time prescribed
by law.
3. The Same Emperors and Csesars.
Exemption from personal burdens and services is only granted to veterans where
they are proved to have served twenty years in the army, either in a legion
itself, or as members of a color-guard, and can show that they have obtained an
honorable discharge for full service, or one to ill-health. Therefore, as you
state that you have only Served in a cohort, you will understand that you have
no ground for claiming exemption from civil duties.
FROM WHAT CIVIL SERVICES THOSE ARE EXEMPT WHO, , AFTER HAVING COMPLETED THEIR
TIME IN THE ARMY, OR THE DUTIES TO WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED IN THE
PROVINCES, ENGAGE IN THEIR OWN AFFAIRS AND BUSINESS AT HOME, AND THEIR
PRIVILEGES, AND CONCERNING FARMERS OF THE REVENUE.
1. This Law is not Authentic.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars.
It is certain that no others are exempt from civil duties and dignities than
those who have leased the collection of taxes from the Treasury in their own
names; and therefore no legal doubt can be entertained that persons who have
been appointed by them as their deputies are not entitled to claim this
privilege.
TITLE LVI. CONCERNING FREEDMEN.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars.The status of freedman
does not afford exemption from civil duties, even in the city where the
freedman has his domicile.
TITLE LVII.
CONCERNING INFAMOUS PERSONS. 1. The Emperor Antoninus.
Although infamous persons cannot be promoted to dignities which are only
conferred upon those of honorable reputation, they are, nevertheless, not
exempt from the performance of civil duties, or of those of the decurionate,
but are required to make contributions demanded by the public welfare.
TITLE LVIII.
CONCERNING PERSONS ACCUSED OF CRIME. 1. The Emperor Alexander.
It has often been stated in rescripts by My ancestors, the Emperors, that
persons accused of crime cannot be raised to any new dignities before having
established their innocence.
TITLE LIX. CONCERNING THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN CONDEMNED TO
EXILE, OR SUSPENDED FROM THEIR ORDER. 1. The Emperor Marcus Antoninus to
Diogenes.Decurions who have been suspended from their order for a certain time
cease to be infamous after that time has expired.
2. The Emperor Gordian.
A decurion who has been sentenced to exile for a specified term, and returns
after it has expired, will recover his former rank, but cannot be promoted to
new honors, until as much time has elapsed as passed while he was absent in
flight.
TITLE LX.
CONCERNING SONS UNDER PATERNAL CONTROL, AND TO WHAT EXTENT THEIR FATHER Is
RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus.
It is a perfectly clear rule of law that a father is not responsible for his
emancipated son, even if he has given his consent for him to be made a
decurion, for where he has agreed to this, he will only be liable if his son is
under his control. He, however, is considered to have consented, if he did not
show any opposition to his appointment.
2. The Emperor Antoninus.
As you state that you have appealed, you must prove that your individual
interests are involved, for you can only oppose the appointment of your son,
and cannot consent that the responsibilities of the office shall be imposed
upon you.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars.
If those called by their father to perform the duties of the pro-tostasiatare
still under paternal control, they will be released from the duties of the
office, for it would appear extremely unjust if two persons belonging to the
same family should be compelled, under such circumstances, to perform these
duties. But you should, without hesitation, retain those sons who it is evident
have been emancipated, and have left their father's family.
4. The Same Emperors and Csesars.
The magistrate appointed your son a curator, without your incurring any
responsibility, and it will not be necessary for you to appeal; for he, without
your consent, nominated your son, who was under your control, and he will be
responsible for any loss which may result from the administration of the
office, unless your son had previously been appointed decurion with your
acquiescence.
TITLE LXI.
CONCERNING THE RESPONSIBILITY OF A PARENT FOR His
HEIRS.
1. The Emperor Alexander.
If your father became responsible, and rendered his own property liable because
of your appointment to the office of priest, the Governor of the province will
not be ignorant of the fact that liability for the expenses incurred will pass
to all his heirs.
TTIITTLLEE LLXXIIII..
CONCERNING WOMEN AND WHERE THEY MAY BECOME
RESPONSIBLE FOR MUNICIPAL SERVICES IMPOSED UPON
OFFICES AND HONORS SUITABLE TO THEIR SEX.
1. The Emperor Philip.
It has frequently been stated in rescripts that where a woman was born in one
place and married in another, and her husband does not reside in the City of
Rome, she can be compelled to accept honors and offices which are personal, and
those of her sex are capable of receiving, not in the city of her birth but
where her husband resides. Women, however, must be responsible for charges
attaching to estates in the places where those estates are situated.
TTIITTLLEE LLXXIIIIII..
CONCERNING EMBASSIES.
1. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus.
The father of three living children is exempt from public embassies.
2. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Valerian.
After having received a certain sum of money in your own name for the public
defence, that which your colleague received for his expenses his heirs will not
be compelled to turn over to you, if it was intended for the same purpose, but
if it should be absolutely necessary for it to be refunded, it must be given to
the government. Where the amount was intended for the compensation of
advocates, you, whose duty it is to pay them, can very properly demand to be
reimbursed. Moreover, you can prosecute your colleague for having neglected his
duty, as you allege that he desisted from the defence of his country, for which
he was appointed.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian.
It has been decided that those who have been appointed to an embassy to Us,
from across the sea, are entitled to exemption from civil services and offices
for the term of two years, but not those who have discharged their duties to
the State from a place near at hand.
4. The Emperor Constantine.
All counts of Governors who have obtained their dignities by suffrage shall be
required to discharge civil duties, lest the public welfare may be injured
through an agreement made with reference to services which had not been
performed. Those, however, who are employed in public embassies, shall be
exempt from the aforesaid burdens.
5. The Emperors Theodosius, Arcadius, and Honorius, to Apode-mius, Prsetorian
Prefect of Illyria.

whatever should be submitted to the consideration of all, or a majority of the
authorities, shall not be brought before an ordinary judge for examination. We
permit you to take cognizance of, and investigate the claims of inhabitants of
the provinces, by whom this is frequently required in the case of unforeseen
events, so that you may inquire into any matters which demand your immediate
attention, and which ought to be brought to Our notice. Any decision, however,
with reference to the general welfare of the people of the province, must be
rendered in a public place, and that which has obtained the approval of a
majority shall be formally confirmed.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifth of the Kalendsof August, during the
Consulate of Arcadius, Consul for the second time, and Rufinus, 392.
6. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Monaxius, Prse-torian Prefect.
Whenever an embassy is sent to Us from the City of Alexandria, We order all the
decurions of the city, if they are not prevented by ill-,ness, or for some
other good reason, to assemble in their accustomed place, and having signed a
decree to communicate it to the illustrious Augustal Prefect, so that, by his
intervention, the demands may be brought to your notice, and the object of the
embassy be determined by your examination.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Nonesof October, during the
Consulate of Our Lord the Emperor Theodosius, Consul for the seventh time, and
Palladius, 416.
TITLE LXIV.
CONCERNING THE EXCUSES OF ARTISANS.
1. The Emperor Constantine to Maximus.
We order that artisans engaged in the trades hereinafter specified, and who
reside in different cities, shall be exempt from all civil duties, above all,
if their leisure is employed in perfecting themselves in occupations by which
they may become more skillful, and their sons be instructed. This enumeration
is as follows: Architects, physicians, painters, sculptors, workers in marble,
manufacturers of beds or chests, locksmiths, chariot-makers, builders, that is
to say masons, woodcarvers, musiarii,gilders, workers in stucco, silversmiths,
bar-baricarii, diatretarii,brokers, founders, signarii,manufacturers,
brochiarii,engineers, potters, who in Greek are called x°^aTa^>goldsmiths,
glaziers, workers in lead, makers of mirrors, workers in ivory, furriers,
fullers, carpenters, plasterers, dealbatares, cusores, trigarii, cisarii,and
bractearii.1

2. The Emperors Constantine and Constans to Leontius, Praetorian Prefect.
We require surveyors, geometers, and architects who are occupied in dividing
land and other property, and whose duty it is to take measurements, and
establish boundaries, as well as those whose business it is to conduct or
remove water, to likewise employ their spare time for the purpose of teaching
others, and extending their own knowledge. Hence they shall enjoy immunity from
civil services and must take a certain number of pupils for the purpose of
giving them instruction.
Given on the day before the Nonesof July, during the Consulate of Leontius and
Sallust, 344.
TITLE LXV.
CONCERNING THE QUALIFICATIONS OF PERSONS APPOINTED
TO OFFICE.
1. The Emperor Antoninus.
If, having been called to perform civil duties, you should think that someone
else is better qualified, you can make a statement to that effect.
TITLE LXVI.
WHERE AN APPOINTMENT Is MADE THROUGH ENMITY.
1. The Emperor Alexander.
If you have been appointed to a civil office on account of enmity entertained
toward you, the justice of the Governor will prevent this appointment from
being a source of injury to you; for it is not advantageous to the State for
appointments to be made through enmity, as this should be done because of
proper qualifications, and with a view to the public welfare.
TITLE LXVII. CONCERNING THE RECOVERY OF EXPENSES.
1. The Emperor Gordian.
'You will not be required to perform the civil duties imposed upon persons, if
you have five living children. If, however, in violation of this privilege, you
should be called upon to perform the duties of public office, after having
taken an appeal, you should state your right to exemption, and you can recover
from those who appointed you the expenses which you have incurred in
litigation.
TITLE LXVIII. WHERE ANYONE DIES AFTER His APPOINTMENT.
1. The Emperor Alexander.
If your father died before enjoying his dignity, or performing the duties of
his office, the Governor of the province can entertain no doubt that his heirs
cannot be held liable on his account.
TITLE LXIX.
CONCERNING BOOKKEEPERS, SECRETARIES, WRITERS OF SPEECHES, AND REGISTERS OF THE
CENSUS.
1. The Emperor Alexander.
No bookkeeper, scribe, writer of speeches, or their sons, shall discharge the
duties of any other office, and if they should do so, they shall immediately be
returned to their municipal employments, even if they are serving in Our
palace, provided that they are discovered within the term of five years.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Marcellinus
and Probinus, 341.
2. The Emperor Gordian.
Any decurion who voluntarily assumes employment in the administration of the
census shall have the place which he himself has chosen; and if it should be
found necessary to subject him to torture, he cannot plead the dignity of his
order by way of exemption.
3. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Hadrian, Prsetorian Prefect.
By this general law, We order that whenever it becomes necessary to appoint
keepers of the archives for entire provinces, or for single cities, freemen
shall be selected, nor can this office hereafter be filled by anyone of servile
condition. If, however, a master should permit his slave or serf to have charge
of public documents (and this must be done with his consent and knowledge), he
will be liable for any loss or damage occasioned by said slave or serf, in
matters connected with the public welfare, and the slave, after having been
scourged, shall be confiscated to the Treasury. Hence it will be to the
interest of masters, in the beginning, to see that their slaves do not concern
themselves with public transactions.
Given at Milan, on the eighth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of
Vicentius and Fabricius, 401.
4. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian.
Philosophers, accountants, writers of speeches, medogrammatici, diastolei(which
designations show that they are employed in the public service), or no matter
under what other names they may pass, when they cannot plead any honor or other
privilege by way of exemption, shall, by the provisions of the laws, inexorably
be compelled to discharge the duties required by their station, so that the
general welfare may not suffer or be injured by their failure to do so, and
they shall be obliged to perform those personal services to which their fathers
or ancestors were liable.
TITLE LXX.
CONCERNING RECEIVERS, SUPERINTENDENTS AND TREASURERS.
1. The Emperor Antoninus.
We decree that public receivers of money should not delay their collections, so
that.no one may be obliged to incur expense on this account. For when anyone
desiring to make payment is repulsed by the receiver, he ought to produce
witnesses to prove the refusal, and, this having been done, he shall be
released from liability for payment, and he who refused to receive the money
shall be compelled by the Governor to pay to the Treasury double the amount
due.
If receivers should violate this law through the neglect of a judge who has
jurisdiction of the case, the latter shall make good the amount out of his own
property.
2. The Emperor Alexander.
Magistrates who appoint receivers and officials having the care of public
warehouses and districts shall, under laws long in operation, be held
responsible for their appointees, if the latter should prove insolvent, as well
as be liable for any property which may fraudulently be lost through sales to
persons who have been introduced for that purpose.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Kalendsof August, during the
Consulate of Valentinian and Valens, 365.
3. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Mamertinus, Praetorian Prefect.
Receivers of public moneys are hereby notified to collect not only what is due
for the present year, but also any unpaid sums for other years which have
already expired.
Given at Rome, on the day before the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate
of Valentinian and Valens, 365.
4. The Same Emperors to Florentius, Count of the Sacred Largesses.
No one who has completed his term of his office as public receiver shall be
continued in the discharge of the same duties, unless he has first released
himself from liability by rendering an account of his former administration;
for it is unjust to hold those responsible who have performed their duty
properly, and it is not wise not to call those to account who have failed to
perform it. Therefore, after the expiration of a year, they shall be compelled
to show what disposition they have made of what they have collected, so that if
any of them should be found guilty of theft, he can the more readily be
compelled to make good the loss.
Nor should collectors have the power to constantly molest the people of the
provinces, as, for instance, by the practice of extortion, but they should be
changed every year, unless either the custom of the
city, or the rules of their order, require them to remain for the term of two
years.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Kalendsof December, during the
Consulate of Our Prince Honorius and Evodius, 386.
5. The Same Emperor.
Whenever a certain sum of solidiis due, and an amount of gold or silver in bulk
is tendered instead, it shall be accepted at the rate of seventy-two solidito
the pound.
Given at Rome, on the sixth of the Idesof January, during the Consulate of
Lupicinus and Jovinus, 367.
6. The Emperors Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian to Chilo.
A record must be made of all grain stored in the public warehouses, and a
receipt immediately given therefor, but only that belonging to the Treasury
shall be placed in the Treasury warehouses.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof April, after the Consulate of Gratian, Consul
for the third time, and Equitius, 374.
7. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Hyptu-tius.
Collections shall not remain a long time in the hands of the receivers, but
shall immediately after being 'obtained from the inhabitants of provinces be
deposited in the Imperial Treasury.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Kalendsof May, after the Consulate
of Antonius and Syagrius, 383.
8. The Same Emperors to Cynegius, Prsstorian Prefect.
Public collectors and receivers shall be appointed at a full meeting of the
decurionate, with the consent and approbation of all or a majority of those
present, and Governors of provinces shall scrutinize the names of those who
have been selected and charged with the performance of official duties, and
always bear in mind that they will be responsible for all the acts of the
administration of those whom they appoint.
Given at Constantinople, on the sixth of the Kalendsof November, during the
Consulate of Our Prince Honorius, and Evodius, 386.
9. The Emperors Valentinian and Arcadius to Cynegius, Prsstorian Prefect.
We order that brazen or stone weights and measures shall be placed at each
public station and city, so that everyone who pays tribute will have under his
eyes the regular standards prescribed for all commodities, and ascertain what
he is obliged to give to the receivers; so that if any of the latter should
exceed the regular measure or weight, he may know that he will undergo the
penalty prescribed for his offence, and having abolished everything which has
heretofore been enacted contrary to the welfare of the people, We hereby decree
that fifty measures of wheat, forty of barley, and twenty of wine and bacon
shall be delivered to the receivers.
Moreover, being induced by motives of humanity, We order that, on account of
the distance, forty measures of corn and barley, and fifteen of wine and bacon
shall be delivered to the receivers in the province of Armenia.
Given at Constantinople, on the fourth of the Kalendsof December, during the
Consulate of Our Prince Honorius, and Evodius, 386.
10. The Same Emperors to Cynegius, Pf&torian Prefect.
The receiver shall draw up and state in the presence of the defenders of the
city the amount of the contribution to be paid by the possessors of land, as
well as the different kinds of commodities, and the number and quantity of
each.
Given at Constantinople, on the fourth of the Kalendsof December, during the
Consulate of Timasius and Promotus, 389.
11. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Benignus, Vicegerent of the City of
Rome.
We desire the receivers of wine to be responsible for the amount receipted for
to the tributaries. The receipts must be produced in public, and, in order that
their genuineness may be established, an account of them must be rendered by
those who gave them.
Given at Milan, on the sixth of the Idesof June, during the Consulate of
Stilicho and Aurelian, 400.
12. The Same Emperors to their Friend, Pompeianus, Greeting:If the owner of
property should detect a receiver or an accountant in the commission of fraud,
he who has been convicted shall not again hold the office during the
administration of which he was guilty of dishonesty, even though he may, by
clandestine means, have obtained an Imperial Rescript authorizing him to do so.
Given at Milan, on the day before the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate
of Stilicho and Aurelian, 400.
13. The Same Emperors to Lucius, Count of the Sacred Largesses.
We order that two registrars or accountants, and the same number of receivers,
be appointed in every province. We desire, moreover, to give notice to the
Prsetorian Prefect that those who make collections for the Imperial Largesses
have nothing in common with the officials charged with the accounts of the
Treasury of the Prefecture, and provincial judges shall be fined five pounds of
gold, and their chief subordinates be punished with death, if this law is not
observed.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of Bassus
and Philip, 401.
14. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to their friend, Eu-chwrius, Greeting:
In order that the public welfare may not suffer, We do not permit decurions to
fill inferior offices, or be subject to extraordinary burdens. Therefore it is
better for the receiver of clothing to be appointed from among the officers of
the Proconsul, or from among those who have
already exercised the same employment. Still, it is important to be careful in
this matter, and to examine the qualifications of candidates so as to select
persons best qualified for the place; for it is inequitable for all the
benefits to belong to the officials above mentioned, and for the decurionate
alone to bear the loss of collection. Hence, We exempt all members of the
decurionate from this injustice, with the exception of those who have either

Some collectors of public money presume to make their collections Withoufhaving

Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of

SECOND EDITION. BBOOOOKK XXLL



TITLE I.
CONCERNING THE TRANSPORTATION OF PUBLIC PROPERTY
BY SHIP-OWNERS OR SHIP-MASTERS, AND THE ABOLITION
OF THE TAX KNOWN AS LUSTRAL GOLD.
1 and 2. These Laws are not Authentic.
3. The Emperor Constantine and the Csesar Julian to Olybrius, Prefect of the
City.
No violence shall be employed against ship-masters engaged in the transport of
tributary grain, nor shall they be put to any annoyance
or trouble, but must enjoy perfect security while both coming and going, and
anyone who attempts to molest them shall be fined ten pounds of gold.
Given at Rome, on the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of Constantius,
Consul for the ninth time, and the Caesar Julian, Consul for the second time,
357.
4. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Eusebius, Prsetorian Prefect.
We have ascertained that certain ship-masters have made property collected by
way of tribute an object of commerce for their own benefit, and therefore We
decree that they must, within a year, turn over whatever they have received,
and take receipts for the same, showing the day of its delivery, which receipts
must be exhibited by them within another year to the persons by whom the
property was delivered for transportation.
Given at Milan, on the tenth of the Kalendsof January, during the third
Consulate of Arcadius and Honorius, 394.
5. The Same Emperors to Flavianus, Prefect of the City.
We wish those who have plundered ship-masters to make good the losses out of
their own property, and therefore, in order to prevent any act of this kind
from taking place hereafter, We decree that whoever is convicted of the robbery
of a ship-master shall be compelled to pay a penalty of fourfold the amount
taken.
Published at Rome, in the Apronian Forum, on the ninth of the Kalendsof
February, during the Consulate of Stilicho and Aurelian, 400.
6. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius.
As there was a scarcity of ships among the ship-masters of the provinces of the
East, and, on the pretext of obtaining vessels, search was made through the
adjoining islands and the opportunity for sailing lost, and, on account of
there being no means of transportation it was feared that the severity of the
authorities would be exerted, it was with reason that Your Highness called
together the Augustal Prefect and the Governor of the islands, together with
the commanders of the fleet of Alexandria and Carpathia, and other ship-
masters, in order that they might be held responsible for the transfer to the
warehouses of the Imperial Metropolis of the supplies of grain usually
transported by eastern ship-owners from the warehouses of Alexandria to the
Capital of the Empire; and in lieu of the small compensation paid for
transportation, immunity from payment of tribute or from the tax called
<f>i\iKovwas conferred upon the said ship-masters, in addition to the other
privileges which were granted during the consultation which took place.
Given on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of
Honorius, Consul for the eighth time, and Theodosius, Consul for the third
time, 409.
7. The Same Emperors to Anthemius, Prsetorian Prefect.
Anyone who, having undertaken the transportation of property belonging to the
government, abandons the direct route of navigation, and, following a different
course, turns aside and sells the property committed to his care, shall be
punished with death.
Given at Constantinople, on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof August, during the
Consulate of Honorius, Consul for the eighth time, and Theodosius, Consul for
the third time, 409.
8. The Same Emperors to Faustinus, Prsetorian Prefect.
Judges who permit loaded ships to remain in districts subject to their
jurisdiction, under pretext of winter, when the weather is favorable for
navigation, shall, with the citizens and the curiaof the place, be compelled to
pay the expenses incurred by the Governor out of their own property. Moreover,
the ship-masters shall suffer the penalty of deportation, if it should be
ascertained that they have committed any fraud.
Given at Ravenna, on the eighteenth of the Kalendsof September,
during the Consulate of Varana, 410.



TITLE II.
CONCERNING LAND AND ALL OTHER PROPERTY BELONGING TO SHIP-OWNERS.
1. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Aurelian, Prefect of Subsistence.
We order that even Our Imperial household shall be responsible ttoothose with
whom it has contracted obligations having reference to property liable in the
name of a ship-owner.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of Lupicinus
and Jovinus, 367.
2. The Same Emperors and Gratian to Achilo, Proconsul of Africa.
So far as property sold by ship-masters is concerned (as it is not right to
prevent anyone from selling or buying), the purchaser shall be responsible for
what is sold by the ship-master, in proportion to his share of the property
disposed of, for the liability attaches to the property, and not to the person
of the vendor. We do not direct that he shall become a ship-master who has
purchased anything from one, but that he shall be liable for whatever he
bought, in proportion to the
value of the same.
For not all that the ship-owner possessed, and a portion of which the trader
obtained, but only that portion which belonged to the shipowner in the
beginning shall be liable for the payment of this obligation, and the residue
of the property, which is not subject to it, shall remain free and exempt.
Again, where a house whose value consists in the beauty and ornamentation of
the city, rather than in the income obtained from it, is sold by a ship-master,
it is settled and it will be liable for this pay-
merit only to the extent of its actual worth in money. Where, however, the land
is of such limited extent that it cannot be subjected to such a charge, or
where there are buildings whose repairs or reconstruction are arduous and
difficult, or where houses are erected (as is frequently the case) merely for
adornment, We are unwilling that any such display of munificence which may
subsequently have taken place should be the subject of dishonorable competition
by bidders; but the former character of the land and the amount of the payment
should be taken into consideration, rather than the daily cultivation of the
soil, whose value is increased by the industry of an energetic man.
3. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Messala, Prsetorian Prefect.
Those who, by any title whatosever, obtain lands belonging to ship-owners, are
compelled to assume the burdens attaching to the same, in accordance with the
value of the property, as appraised in ancient times; and ship-owners are
notified not to think that they can take advantage of this law by voluntarily
disposing of their property through the transfer to persons who are insolvent.
An agreement of this kind, however, shall stand, so that if the land is
conveyed to someone who is insolvent, the vendors will be held liable, and the
Treasury can, first of all, have recourse to those who are solvent for any loss
which it may have sustained.
Given at Milan, on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate
of Theodore, Consul for the fifth time, 399.


TITLE III.
CONCERNING EXCUSES FOR SHIPS WHICH SHALL NOT BE
ACCEPTED.


1. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Longinianus, Prsetorian Prefect.
Many persons protect their ships under various pretexts, and, for the purpose
of preventing this kind of fraud, notice is hereby given that if anyone should
think that, by means of false ownership, he can evade the requirements of the
State, his vessel shall be confiscated to the Treasury. For while We do not
forbid private individuals to own ships, We do not permit them on this account
to be guilty of fraud, as everyone is bound to consult the public welfare when
necessity demands it, and transport the property of the government without
availing himself of any privilege enjoyed by persons of his social or official
station.
Given at Ravenna, on the third of the Idesof January, during the Consulate of
Arcadius, Consul for the seventh time, and Probus, 406.
2. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Florentius, Prse-torian Prefect.
We order that no ship which has the capacity of more than two thousand
modiibefore the happy embolashall be exempt from the
public service, or the transportation of property belonging to the government,
either by reason of some prerogative attaching to rank, or on account of
religion, or because of any personal privilege, not even if an Imperial
Rescript (whether it be an epistle or a pragmatic sanction) should be produced
in opposition to the provisions of this most salutary law.
We desire that the aforesaid rule shall be observed in every instance, so that,
generally speaking, when anything of this kind is brought forward contrary to
law or the public welfare, in any transaction whatsoever, it shall not be
valid. We shall punish any fraudulent attempt made to violate this law in any
way whatsoever by the confiscation of the ship for which exemption is claimed.
TITLE IV. No ADDITION SHALL BE MADE TO PUBLIC BURDENS.
1. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Rufinus, Prsetorian Prefect.
No one shall impose any private charge upon ship-masters who have already
assumed public burdens, nor shall those who have been employed for the
transport of grain be compelled, under any pretext, to assume other
liabilities; for the ship-master will not only be civilly responsible for any
expense incurred, as well as for the loss of his ship, but he will also be
subjected to severe public punishment.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifth of the Idesof January, during the
Consulate of Olybrius and Probinus, 385.



TITLE V. CONCERNING SHIPWRECKS.


1. The Emperor Constantine.
If a vessel is driven on land by shipwreck, or if it goes ashore at any time,
it shall belong to the owners, and My Treasury shall advance no claim to it-;
for what right has the Treasury to take advantage of the misfortunes of others,
so as to profit by such an unhappy occurrence ?
2. The Emperors Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian to Modestus, Prsetorian
Prefect.
Where a ship-master alleges that he has had a wreck, he must hasten to appear
before the judge of the province, who has jurisdiction, and prove the fact, by
witnesses in his presence. A report shall then be made to the eminent
Prefecture, so that the truth having been established within a year, the matter
may properly be disposed of. It has been decided that if, through negligence,
the term of a year should be permitted to elapse, any claims presented after
that time shall not be admitted as being worthless, and introduced too late.
Given on the Nonesof June, during the Consulate of Modestus and Arinthius, 372.
3. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to the Shipmasters of
Africa.
Whenever ships have been destroyed or sunk, an investigation shall be made by a
competent judge, and two or three sailors must be examined, but the others
should be released from any proceeding of this kind; for an expert questioner
can obtain abundant information from the number of sailors aforesaid. The
pilots, who have more knowledge, should be selected for this purpose; or if
they have lost their lives, inquiry should be made of others. Moreover, when
the violence of the storm has killed all the sailors, in order that the truth
may be ascertained, their children, or those of the pilots can, after having
been brought into court, be interrogated with reference to the death of those
whom the ship-master asserts to have perished. The time of an inquiry of this
kind shall run from the Kalendsof April, to the first of the Kalendsof October.
Given on the eighth of the Idesof February, during the Consulate of Gratian and
Theodosius, 380.
4. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Tati-anus, Prsetorian
Prefect.
Where property has been subjected to contribution and then lost in shipwreck,
We are unwilling that those by whom this was done shall be, in any way
molested, or held responsible by Us, whether they are senators or private
individuals.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof August, during the
Consulate of Tatianus and Symmachus, 391.
5. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to the Ship-masters of Africa.
With reference to wrecked ships, We decree that the cases shall be heard with
all diligence, and if anyone is convicted of having appropriated property under
such circumstances, the judge before whom this is proved shall have power to
fine, deport, and proscribe those who are guilty, in accordance with their
rank. If, however, he should neglect to hear the case within two years, and
this time has elapsed, he will be responsible, the ship-master must be
discharged on account of the fault of the judge, and the latter will be
compelled to pay the value of half of the cargo of the vessel, and his
subordinates shall pay the other half, on account of his failure to decide the
case within the time prescribed by law.
Given at Ravenna, on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate
of Honorius, Consul for the ninth time, and Theodosius, Consul for the fifth
time, 412.
6. The Same Emperors.
Where an investigation of a shipwreck is made in the usual way, and it is found
that the vessel was lost in a storm, you should not
grant release of liability for the cargo, but its value must be apportioned pro
rataamong the owners of the ship in a suitable manner.



TITLE VI.
CONCERNING MINERS, MINES, AND THE SUPERINTENDENTS OP THE LATTER.


1. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Cresconius, Count of the Mines.
After due deliberation, We have considered it proper to order that anyone who
wishes to engage in the business of mining shall, in addition to what he gains,
provide for the State by his own labor. Therefore) those who voluntarily pursue
this occupation must be compelled by Your Excellency to pay to the government
eight scruples to the ounce, which is called in Greek xpv<ra-w°s-Anything which
they may obtain over and above this amount shall preferably be sold to the
Treasury, and the proper price be paid for it out of the Treasury of Our
Largesses.

3. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Florus, Praetorian

the remainder for themselves.
Given at Constantinople, on the fourth of the Kalendsof September, during the
Consulate of Antonius and Syagrius, 382.
4. The Same Emperors to Eusinius, Prastorian Prefect.
As the superintendents of mines in Macedonia, in that part of Dacia situated on
the Mediterranean, and in Mysia and Dardania, appointed by the decurions of
these provinces to regularly collect what is due to the government from the
mines, sometimes abandon their places through pretended fear of the enemy, they
shall be returned to the discharge of their duties, and none of them shall
hereafter be permitted to fill any other office before they have, with energy
and diligence, completed the term for which they were appointed to superintend
the mines.
5. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosii, and Arcadius to Romu-lus, Count of the
Imperial Largesses.
Miners pursuing their occupations both in the province of Pontus and in that of

Imperial Largesses for every man employed.

Consulate of Arcadius, Consul for the second time, and Rufinus, 392.

We have learned that certain persons, under the pretext of opening quarries,

foundations of buildings. In cases of this kind, no one shall be given
permission to make such excavations, even if marble is said to be situated
under the foundations of the buildings.

Consulate of Theodosius, Consul for the third time, and Abundantius, 393.

emigrated to another, should undoubtedly, together with their offspring, be
returned without delay to the place of their birth, even though they may have
obtained employment in Our Imperial household. Moreover, they are hereby
notified that they can, in no way, prejudice the rights of the Treasury, even
if any one of them, who proved to be a minor, should have had his name
inscribed upon the register of the census.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifth of the Idesof July, during the Consulate
of Victor, 424.

2. The Same Emperor.
Persons employed in dyeing establishments, and the apartments of women where
the manufacture and dyeing of cloths for the use
of the palace are carried on, shall not endeavor to retain such places by
intrigue, for fear that the goods manufactured there may, by adulteration, be
rendered of inferior value, and if anyone should violate this law he shall be
put to death.
3. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to the Consular, Ger-manus.
Freeborn women, who marry the overseers of gyneceums,in violation of formal
warning given to them, and who prefer a disgraceful union of this kind to the
nobility of their race, shall be reduced to the condition of their husbands.

of Auxonius and Olybrius, 380.
7. The Same Emperors to Hesperius, Prsetorian Prefect.
We decree that no woman of high rank shall degrade herself by a shameful union
with a man employed in the coinage of money. If anyone should violate this law,
and does not renounce the connexion which she has formed, but still adheres to
the union with the coiner, there is no doubt that she will prejudice both
herself and her children, and be reduced to the condition of her companion.
(1) If any woman who is the dependent or vassal of another, without the
knowledge of her master, or even with his knowledge, should unite herself with
a man engaged in the coinage of money, and her master, having been notified,
does not immediately separate these persons, and resume possession of his
vassal, he, having tacitly renounced control over her, is hereby notified that
he will afterwards have no right to claim her services.
(2) As We are unwilling for a woman of different status to be united with a
coiner of money, so We forbid the union of the daughter of a coiner and a man

belong.
Given at Heraclia, on the ninth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate

compelled to pay a fine of two pounds of gold.

own status, and alleged to have accepted honors and employments forbidden to

condition. Those, however, who, it is evident, have become possessed of the
property of persons restricted by their birth to certain occupations, shall be
compelled to return said property to its former owners, no matter under what
title they may have obtained possession of the same. If, however, those having
possession of such property choose to be subjected to the disabilities of a
condition inferior to their own, rather than to restore the property, they are
hereby notified that they will hereafter be considered members of the
profession of those whose property they have acquired, and they are also
notified that they will be held strictly accountable for
any balance due from said owners, without being allowed to offer any excuse
whatsoever.
Given at Constantinople, on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof November, during
the Consulate of Victor, 424.

another condition, are notified that they follow the condition of their mother.

those of the linen weavers, lympharii,masters of the mint, dyers of purple, or
any other associations connected with the Imperial Largesses, should hereafter
desire to retire from the body to which he belongs, he shall not readily be
released and another substituted in his place, but only such persons as you may
approve as suitable shall be accepted.
Moreover, he who, through Imperial favor, has been permitted to have his place
taken by another, shall entertain no doubt that he and his children, together
with all their property, will still remain connected with the body from which
they have been permitted to withdraw.
Given at Constantinople, on the seventh of the Kalendsof March, during the
Consulate of the Emperors Theodosius, Consul for the twelfth time, and

chiefs of the weavers and dyers, and all other persons charged with duties of
this kind, shall not be permitted to perform them, or to have access to the

hereafter, ask to be excused from furnishing such security.

TITLE VIII.

IMPERIAL PURPLE.
1. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Archelaus, Count of the Imperial

private use, as We order that they shall only be made in the gyneceums.

Consulate of our Prince Valentinian and Victor, 369.
2. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Florus, Praetorian

the Imperial prerogatives. Anyone who makes use of such forbidden garments, to
which he has no right, shall be severely punished.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Kalendsof April, during the
Consulate of Antonius and Syagrius, 382.
3. The Emperors Theodosius, Arcadius, and Honorius.
We do not permit wool to be dyed with any color resembling the Imperial purple,
nor do We permit silk to be dyed rose-color, and afterwards with another tint,
but there is no reason why white should not be dyed any color whatsoever. Those
who violate this law shall suffer the punishment of death.
4. The Emperor Theodosius to Maximin, Count of the Sacred Largesses.
Let all persons of either sex and of every rank, trade, profession, and
station, abstain from the possession of clothing expressly reserved for the
Emperor and his family, and let no one weave or make silk cloaks and tunics in
his own house. Everything dyed with the Imperial purple, without being mixed
with any other color, shall be removed from the building where this was done,
and all tunics and cloaks which are dyed with the Imperial purple shall be
surrendered. No threads dyed with Imperial purple shall hereafter be woven into
cloth, and all garments entirely composed of silk shall, in the future, be
delivered to Our Treasury; and let no one demand payment for the same, as
impunity from violated law will be sufficient compensation.
Again, in order that no one may subsequently incur the penalty of this New
Constitution, We decree that he shall be considered guilty of high treason.
Given at Constantinople, on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof February, during
the Consulate of Victor, 424.
5. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian.
We have again, by the provisions of a recent law, forbidden traffic in purple,
although it was already prohibited by innumerable constitutions. And We now
order that, at a certain time, there shall be sent
to the Phoenician manufacturers the seventh officer of the Bureau of Receipts,
the sixth of the Bureau of Imposts, the fifth of the Bureau of Archives, the
fourth of the Bureau of the Imperial Wardrobe, and in order that they may not
be guilty of fraud, and may exert proper diligence, We decree that they shall
be fined twenty pounds of gold iiffthey do not properly discharge the duties
required of them.
Given at Constantinople, on the eighth of the Idesof March, during the
Consulate of Isidore and Senator, 436.
TITLE IX.
CONCERNING MANUFACTURERS.
1. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Tati-anus, Prsetorian
Prefect.
We order that all manufacturers shall deliver the articles made by them, and
not pay money in their stead, and that the iron furnished shall be of good
quality, and readily melted, in order that there may be less opportunity for
fraud, and the public welfare be the better
provided for.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of
Theodosius, Consul for the second time, and Cynegius, 388.
2. The Emperors to Rufinus, Master of the Offices.
We order that the chief of the manufacturers shall, after the lapse of two
years of continuous service, be not only discharged, but also treated with
honor; and be included among the protectors of the guild of manufacturers, as
well as sent every two years for the purpose of congratulating the Emperor.
Given at Milan, on the eighth of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of
Valentinian, Consul for the fourth time, and Neotherius, 393.
3. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Osius, Master of the Offices.
Indelible marks, that is to say, well-known brands, should be placed upon the
arms of apprentices to manufacturers, so that in this way they may easily be
recognized, if they should attempt to conceal themselves, and that those who
are marked in this way, as well as their children, can unquestionably be
identified by their guild whenever they surreptitiously, for the purpose of
avoiding labor, have succeeded in obtaining admission to membership in any
other guild.
Given at Constantinople, on the eighteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the
Consulate of Honorius, Consul for the fourth time, and Eutychianus, 398.
4. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Anthemius, Prsetorian Prefect.
When anyone desires to be enrolled in the Organization of Manufacturers in the
city in which he was born, or in which he has fixed his domicile, after they
have been assembled, and before any docu-
ments are drawn up, he must prove that neither his grandfather nor his father
was a decurion, and that he owes nothing to the Order of the Decurionate, and
is under no liability to any citizen, and, after the proper formalities have
been complied with before the Governor of the province, or (if he should be
absent) before the defender of the city, the candidate shall be admitted into
the association which he has selected.
If, in violation of the provisions of this law, anyone should secretly obtain
admission to the guild of manufacturers, he is hereby notified that he shall be
returned to the order to which he belongs, and compelled to discharge his
duties to his country, and that no privilege of time, or previous service will
entitle him to exemption.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof June, during the
Consulate of Honorius, Consul for the ninth time, and Theodosius, 412.
5. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian.
It has been provided by law that artisans must confine themselves to their own
trades, and, together with their children, remain in the one to which they
belong, until their labors are ended by death.
Finally, any offence committed by one renders the entire number responsible,
which rule has been established to cause them to be more careful in the
selection of their members, and exercise supervision over their acts, since the
loss sustained by one is felt by all. Therefore, all of them constitute, as it
were, but a single body, and are compelled to answer for the delinquency of
one, when circumstances demand it.
6. The Emperors Leo and Anthemius to Eufirmius, Master of the Offices.
We order that those artisans engaged in manufactures for the Emperor, as well
as their wives and children, who are also said to be artisans, shall not be
required to answer in court, unless before the tribunal of Your Highness, to
whose jurisdiction they belong and under whose power they are. Nor shall they,
after their term of service has expired, under any circumstances, be liable to
civil or curial obligations, or be illegally molested by the illustrious
Governors of provinces or their subordinates.
7. The Emperor Anastasius to the Master of the Offices.
No member of the guild of manufacturers shall hereafter lease property, or
engage in the management or cultivation of land belonging to another; and any
owner who ventures to violate this law by knowingly entrusting his personal
effects or land to the administration of artisans shall lose it; and the
latter, after having undergone severe punishment and the confiscation of their
property, shall be sentenced to perpetual exile.
Every time that it may be necessary to require the transport of arms, Your
Highness shall notify the eminent Prefecture, and state
the quantity of arms, and the place from which they are to be transferred, in
order that the Prefect may immediately order the illustrious Governor of the
province to provide ships or vehicles out of those belonging to the public, for
the conveyance of said arms, in accordance with the notice served upon him by
Your Highness. If, after notice has thus been given by Your Highness to the
Prefecture as aforesaid, delay or negligence on the part of the authorities
should occur, and the transport of the arms should, for this reason, be
prevented, We order that the accountant at that time in office in the
Prefecture shall, with the other officials responsible for the delay, be
sentenced to a fine of fifty pounds of gold, and that the said amount of gold
shall be paid into the Treasury as soon as it is collected. In addition to
this, We subject the illustrious Governor of the province, as well as his
subordinates, to a fine of thirty pounds of gold, when, through their
connivance, the transport of arms was delayed.
TITLE X.
CONCERNING THE VALUE OP ANCIENT MONEY.
1. The Emperor Constantine.
We order that the solidicoined by former Emperors shall be paid and accepted by
purchasers and vendors, and that no dispute shall arise with reference to them,
provided they are of the proper weight, and genuine, and all persons are hereby
notified that if they violate this law they will be subjected to severe
punishment.
2. The Same Emperor.
When the value of a solidusis depreciated, it is necessary for all articles
purchased with it to be diminished in the same proportion.
3. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosii^.
You must notify all persons by the proposed Edict that an uniform value of all
bryzat solidiwill be established, and that anyone who, through the blindness of
avarice, either disobeys Our orders or fraudulently attempts to change the
appearance of these coins, will be punished by death.
TITLE XI.
No ONE SHALL BE PERMITTED TO ADORN THE BRIDLES.OR
SADDLES OF THEIR HORSES OR THEIR OWN BELTS WITH
PEARLS, EMERALDS, OR HYACINTHS, AND CONCERNING THE
ARTIFICERS OF THE PALACE.
1. The Emperor Justinian.
No one shall hereafter be permitted to decorate the bridles and saddles of his
horses, or his own belts with pearls, emeralds, or hyacinths, or to insert them
therein. We, however, permit them to adorn the bridles and saddles of their
horses, and their own belts with other
jewels. We order that, hereafter, all jewels of every description shall be
removed from cucurnii,and that buckles which are valuable only for the gold of
which they are composed, and their workmanship, shall be used on military
cloaks.
Moreover, if anyone should violate this law, he is hereby notified that he will
immediately be fined fifty pounds of gold. Again, no private person shall be
permitted to make anything out of gold and jewels, which is reserved for
Imperial use and adornment (with the exception of ornaments usually worn by
women, and the rings of both sexes), and no one shall be allowed to manufacture
anything of this kind under the color or pretext of making a present of the
same to the Emperor, for he does not expect it, nor does the reverence due to
royalty require such donations by private individuals.
If anyone should, hereafter, violate any of the provisions of this law, and be
so bold as to fabricate any ornaments decorated with gold and jewels which are
exclusively destined for the use of the Emperor, with a view to their being
offered to him, he is hereby notified that he will be sentenced to pay a fine
of a hundred pounds of gold, and also suffer capital punishment.
Imperial ornaments must be made in the palace, by the artificers attached to
the same, and not indiscriminately in private residences or workshops.
Therefore, We order that this offence shall be punished with exemplary
severity, in order that private persons may not rashly venture to make what is
solely reserved for the splendor and adornment of the sovereign. If anyone
should commit an act in violation of this law, We order that the fine above
mentioned shall be collected by the officers of the palace, and paid into the
Treasury of the Imperial Largesses.
TITLE XII. CONCERNING MARINES.
1. The Emperors Valentinicm and Valens to Auxonius, Prsetorian Prefect.
We desire the Seleucian fleet, as well as all the others, to be subject to the
orders of the office which is dependent upon Your Excellency, so that the
number of marines may be made up from the volunteers or supernumeraries of
other fleets, and We direct that of Seleucia to be placed .at the disposition
of the Count of the East, for the purpose of clearing the seas of pirates, and
for any other necessary service.
TITLE XIII. CONCERNING THE DECURIALS OF THE CITY OP ROME.
1. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Tri-folius, Prietorian
Prefect.
When anyone thinks that a decurial should be deprived of privileges by process
of law, he is notified that application must be made to the judge of the curia.
Given at Milan, on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof February, during the
Consulate of Timasius and Promotus, 389.
2. The Emperors Arcadius, Honorius, and Theodosius to Exuper-antius, Julius and
other Decurials.
We, by Our authority, confirm the laws relating to decurials enacted by former
Emperors, as well as by Our Divine Father. Therefore, We desire all judges to
be informed that no one can, with impunity, attempt to subject a member of this
body to any corporeal penalty, or venture to deprive him of any of the
privileges which have been legally conferred upon him, for We wish this
association to retain all its ancient privileges.
Given at Rome, on the eighth of the Idesof July, during the Consulate of
Honorius, Consul for the sixth time, and Aristenetus, 404.
TITLE XIV.
CONCERNING THE PRIVILEGES ENJOYED BY MEMBERS OP CORPORATE BODIES OF THE CITY OF
ROME.
1. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Alypius, Prefect of
the City.
No one shall be permitted, or have the right to impose any new burden upon the
inhabitants of the City of Rome, but, for the honor of the Eternal City, We
order that the privileges of the members of its bodies corporate shall remain
intact. The members of such bodies of the City of Rome who have established
homes in foreign countries, shall be compelled by the Governors of the
provinces to return, in order that they may discharge the duties which, from
ancient times, have been formally imposed upon them.
TITLE XXVV..CONCERNING BAKERS.
1. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius.
Any slave of the Superintendent of the Public Warehouses, who either through
intrigue, favor, the use of money, or by any other means, may hereafter obtain
a dignity or an office, shall be deprived of what he acquired in violation of
Our order, and, having been fined twenty pounds of gold, shall be returned to
the body to which he formerly belonged.
Every special privilege which, under any circumstances, has been obtained
contrary to this law, is hereby absolutely annulled.
TITLE XVI.
CONCERNING THE PORK-BUTCHEKS, WINE-MEKCHANTS, AND OTHER CORPORATIONS.
1. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Albinus, Prefect of
the City.
As dealers in hogs in the Eternal City are engaged in an occupation
advantageous to the Roman people, they shall forever be exempt from the
performance of ignoble services.
Given at Rome, on the eighth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate
of Timasius and Promotus, 389.
2. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius.
Any member of the corporation of pork butchers, who appears in court either as
plaintiff or defendant, will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Urban
Prefect.
Given at Rome, on the eighteenth of the Kalendsof February, during the
Consulate of Bassus and Philip, 408.
TITLE XVII.
CONCERNING MEMBERS OP CORPORATIONS AND MONEY BROKERS.
1. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Cyrus, Prefect of the City.
When any persons, under the pretext of being deans or members of corporate
bodies, do not discharge the duties of the same, or attempt to evade other
obligations, We think that their fraudulent acts should be opposed, lest
someone, on the ground of already having one employment, may claim exemption
from the burdens of another, and to prevent the functions of bankers or brokers
from being avoided by those who have only the titles of members of corporate
bodies, or deans. Therefore, if one of such persons should call himself a
member of a corporate body, or a dean, while he is only such in name, he is
hereby notified that another who is capable of the discharge of the duties
aforesaid shall be subrogated, in his place, as in the subrogation of the
persons above mentioned, or that of those who are removed by death, dependent
always upon the consent of the superior officer of the individual subrogated.
(1) So far as the supernumeraries who are enrolled in such bodies are
concerned, none of them can be excused on the ground of patronage, or by virtue
of any other privilege, for this is Our decree, and it is the duty of Your
Highness and your office to diligently see that it is obeyed. We order that
this shall apply equally to all persons, so that no one attached to Our palace,
as well as those belonging to the churches, may succeed in being excused on
account of any favor or prerogative whatever.
But in order that We may not appear to have promulgated this rule solely with
reference to those actually employed, We direct it to
be stated and published that, where any transfer is made from the provinces by
means of a petition of the members of a corporation, this shall be done under
the terms of a former constitution; that is to say, the rule which was laid
down in the first place shall subsequently be observed without any innovation.
TITLE XVIII.
CONCERNING LIBERAL STUDIES IN THE CITIES OP ROME AND CONSTANTINOPLE.
1. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian, to the Prefect of the City.
We order that all those who, having illegally assumed the title of professor,
are accustomed to teach their pupils, collected together from all parts of the
world, and assembled in public places, or in cells, shall not continue to
practice this vulgar ostentation; and if anyone should attempt to do so, after
We have prohibited and condemned it by the promulgation of the present law, he
shall not only be branded with the infamy which he deserves, but shall also be
expelled from the city where he unlawfully pursues his calling.
We do not, however, apply this prohibition to such as are accustomed to impart
instruction privately, in the homes of their scholars, where they only occupy
themselves with the latter, and teach them in their own houses; but where they
are among those who have been appointed lecturers of the Capitol, they are
hereby notified that they are forbidden, under all circumstances, to give
lessons in the homes of their pupils, and they are warned that if they are
convicted of having violated this law they will be absolutely deprived of the
privileges by virtue of which ;they have been authorized to only impart
instruction in the Capitol. Therefore they shall have the special right to give
instruction, in the first place, in those branches of knowledge which the
teaching of Roman eloquence approves; that is to say, the professors of oratory
shall be three in number, and there shall be four professors of grammar, and
also among those who are known to excel in serious declamation, five sophists
and ten rhetoricians shall be appointed.
But as We do not desire youths only to receive instruction in these arts, We
have deemed it proper to associate with the professors above enumerated others
of more profound learning and scientific attainments. Hence, We wish one who is
competent to explain the secrets of philosophy, and two versed in jurisprudence
and the laws to be joined with them.
Your Highness shall see that special places are assigned to each of the above-
mentioned instructors, so that neither the scholars nor the teachers may
interrupt one another, and no confusion of tongues or of voices may distract
the ears or minds of any of them from the study of letters.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Kalendsof March, during the
Consulate of Theodosius, Consul for the eleventh time, and Valentinian, 425.
TITLE XIX.
CONCERNING THE VEHICLES OP PERSONS INVESTED WITH
HONORS.
1. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Ne-bridius, Prefect of
the City.
Persons who have been invested either with civil or military honors shall
always be entitled to make use of vehicles suitable to their rank, that is to
say, carriages, in this Imperial City.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Kalendsof February, during the
Consulate of Our Prince Honorius, and Evodius, 386.
TITLE XX.
CONCERNING THE PRIVILEGES OF THE CITY OF CONSTANTINOPLE.
1. The Emperor Ronorius and Theodosius.
The City of Constantinople shall not only enjoy the privileges enjoyed by
Italy, but also those of ancient Rome.
TITLE XXI. CONCERNING THE METROPOLIS OF BERYTUS.
1. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Hormisdas, Prss-torian Prefect.
We decree that the City of Berytus, already renowned for its admirable
qualities, shall, for good and sufficient reasons, be adorned with the title
and dignity of a metropolis, and therefore it is hereby constituted a
metropolitan city. Tyre shall lose none of its rights, but shall remain the
capital of the province, through the favor granted by Our ancestors. Berytus
shall become a metropolis by our own authority, and both cities shall enjoy the
same privileges.
TITLE XXII.
CONCERNING THE CONTRIBUTION OF GRAIN MADE TO THE CITY OF ROME.
1. The Emperors Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian to Julianus, Prefect of
Subsistence.
Masters of ships must swear before Governors or magistrates that the grain
which they have received is of good quality, and the official
before whom this oath is taken must satisfy himself by actual inspection that
none of it is spoiled. The Prefect of Subsistence is ordered to see that this
is done at the time when the grain is brought to the port of the Imperial City.
Given on the eighteenth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Gratian
and Dagalaifus, 366.
2. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to the Senate.
Where immunity from the delivery of wheat or barley to the City is granted, it
will be void, as rescripts specially issued contrary to the public welfare are
of no force or effect.
Given at Milan, on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate
of Csesarius and Atticus, 397.
3. The Same Emperors to Messala, Prsetorian Prefect.
We shall not, hereafter, permit anyone to petition for exemption from sending
provisions to the City of Rome, nor shall We suffer any rescripts, which may
have been obtained in any way for that purpose, to be considered valid.
We decree that those who violate this law shall be liable to a penalty of
double damages, and any vicegerents or other magistrates who may, hereafter, be
convicted of the misappropriation of grain destined for the city shall suffer
the penalty of deportation, and their principal subordinates be put to death.
Given on the fourth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of Theodore,
Consul for the fifth time, 399.
TITLE XXIII.
CONCERNING GRAIN DESTINED FOR THE CITY OF CONSTANTINOPLE.
1. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Ursus, Prefect of the City.
No one, not even a member of the Imperial household, shall be furnished with
grain from the public warehouses for the purpose ol subsistence; but the entire
amount shall be delivered to slaves, and be baked into bread for distribution
among the houses. For it is in this way that the privileges granted by the
Emperor Constantine ol glorious memory, as well as by My grandfather the
Emperor Theodosius, should be observed; for want will increase, if gram given
lor the purpose of subsistence is known to have been applied to other uses, and
the people will be compelled to purchase for themselves what they otherwise
would have been able to sell to others.
Given at Constantinople, on the tenth of the Kalendsof August, during the
Consulate of Theodore, Consul for the seventh time, and Palladtus, 416.
2. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Leontius, Prefect of the City.
The sum set apart for the purchase of grain shall remain the same forever, nor
shall any Prefect of the City, after his administration is terminated, be
permitted to diminish the said sum, or convert it to other uses, but a written
statement shall be filed, setting forth the amount furnished bakers, as well as
the quantity of bread to be delivered by them without their being subjected to
extortion.
We order that anyone who dares to violate this law by fraudulently
appropriating any of said grain shall restore double the amount, and any profit
which may be obtained by way of interest shall be added to the principal, and
be classed as such, to be expended in the purchase of grain. The provisions of
this law shall be inscribed upon tables of brass.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifth of the Kalendsof December, during the
Consulate of Ariobindus and Aspar, 434.
TITLE XXIV. CONCERNING CIVIL CONTRIBUTIONS OF GKAIN.
1. The Emperors Theodosius, Arcadius, and Honorius to Proculus, Prefect of the
City.
It is perfectly clear that, by virtue of the privilege granted by the Divine
Constantine, contributions of grain for public subsistence should be made, not
so much on account of rank, as because of the merits of individuals, and
therefore none of such persons shall have the right, as a member of a
privileged class, to claim any of such contributions. Where, however, they have
been bestowed on account of personal merit, they shall be valid; so that where
anyone has transferred the privilege of obtaining subsistence either to his own
heirs by right of blood, or to strangers by sale, the transaction shall stand,
whether the title is based upon inheritance or alienation.
Given at Constantinople, on the seventh of the Kalendsof July, during the
Consulate of Arcadius, Consul for the second time, and Rufinus, 392.
2. The Emperor Martian.
We grant, by Our liberality, in addition to the usual allowance, a donation of
a hundred and twenty-five measures of wheat out of the grain stored in the
public warehouses of this city, for every day of the present sixth indiction,
dating from the first of the Kalendsof January. And We order that instructions
to this effect shall be sent to the Sublime Prefecture of the East, in order
that it may be informed of the amount of Our donation and immediately comply
with Our commands. We direct this apportionment always to be granted to Our
subjects hereafter, and that this law shall be perpetually valid.
TITLE XXV. CONCERNING STURDY BEGGARS.
1. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Severus, Prefect of the
City.
All those who adopt the uncertain calling of public beggars shall be examined
and their physical condition and age be ascertained, and if they have been
reduced to this state through idleness, and not by disease, those of them who
are slaves shall become the property of the person who detected them. Where,
however, they are free by birth, they shall be subjected as vassals to whoever
has exposed them and proved their imposture. If they are fugitives, or others
have advised them to adopt the profession of beggars, the rights of action of
their masters shall remain unimpaired.
Given on the twelfth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Antonius
and Syagrius, 382.
TITLE XXVI. CONCERNING BOATS PLYING ON THE TIBER.
1. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Symmachus, Prefect of the City.
Anyone who is shown to have a vessel for navigation on the Tiber shall be
subjected to the burdens imposed by the State. Therefore, any vessel found upon
the Tiber will be liable to the proper and ordinary services exacted by the
government, and no rank or privilege will avail to obtain exemption from this
public requirement.
Given on the eighth of the Idesof October, during the Consulate of the Divine
Jovian, and Varronian, 364.
TITLE XXVII.
CONCERNING GRAIN DESTINED FOR THE CITY OF ALEXANDRIA.
1. The Emperors Honorms and Theodosius to Anthemius, Prse-torian Prefect.
In estimating the amount of grain which should be transported to the City of
Alexandria, We confirm the provisions made by Your Highness concerning the
duties of crithologuesand zygostases,and the preservation of the property
belonging to masters of vessels. We order that decurions shall be deprived of
the opportunity for peculation, and that they shall be excluded from the
exercise of these functions, which shall be discharged by officials whose
appointment and capacity have been approved by you.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifth of the Kalendsof February, during the
Consulate of Honorius, Consul for the ninth time, and Theodosius, 412.
2. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Isidore, Prseto-rian Prefect.
We decree that a hundred and ten measures of grain shall be added to the daily
apportionment of the City of Alexandria, and that no one shall be deprived of
the amount which he has received up to the present time. We also decree that
what has previously been distributed under the name of perissochoregiashall
hereafter be designated as alms bestowed in the name of the Emperor.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Nonesof June, during the
Consulate of Isidore and Senator, 436.
TITLE XXVIII. CONCERNING THE PRIMATES OF THE CITY OP ALEXANDRIA.
1. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Isidore, Praetorian Prefect.
We release the corporate bodies of the City of Alexandria from the duty of
taking care of the river, and, in accordance with the tenor of your
regulations, decree that four hundred solidishall be set aside annually for
this purpose from the tax imposed upon the said city, which has been collected
in different ways from ships plying on the Nile.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Nonesof July, during the
Consulate of Isidore and Senator, 436.
TITLE XXIX. CONCERNING THE RIGHTS OF THE STATE.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Dionysius.
It has been decided that if any judgment should be rendered against the State,
in a case in which no defence was made, and defenders were not, nor should have
been appointed, no prejudice will result, so far as any actions to which the
State may be entitled are concerned.
2. The Same Emperor to Phorodius and Others.
Inquiry should be made of the judge having jurisdiction whether the State, to
whose place you have succeeded, for the reason that you allege that you have
satisfied the debt due to it, still retains the right of hypothecation to the
land in question. If it did not acquire that right through some special
provision made for the purpose, and this was not expressly stated in the
obligation, its case should not be distinguished from that of other creditors
who have the right of personal action.
3. The Emperor Alexander to Salvinius.
In extraordinary proceedings, it is customary for relief to be granted to the
State in the same way as to a female minor.
4. The Emperor Diocletian and Maximian to Urbanus.
If, in conformity to custom, the city you have mentioned sold the land occupied
by ruined buildings, the Governor of the province will permit nothing to be
done which is contrary to this practice.
TITLE XXX. CONCERNING THE ADMINISTRATION OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS.
1. The Emperor Gordian.
It is perfectly evident that the possessor of land under emphyteusis cannot be
deprived of the same without his consent, if the rent is regularly paid at the
time when it is due.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars.
You are aware that proceedings for the collection of damages should be
instituted against those who administer the affairs of the State, and are
required by the duties of their office to accept a trust left under a
condition, but have failed to discharge their duties in this respect.
TITLE XXXI.
CONCERNING THE SALE OF PROPERTY BELONGING TO THE
STATE.
1. The Emperor Alexander.
If you purchased land sold by the government unconditionally, and the sale has
been perfected, you need be under no apprehension that you can be deprived of
the ownership of the same by the subsequent offer of a higher price, provided
the time designated for such an offer to the Treasury has expired, unless the
city in question is, under such circumstances, controlled by a local custom.
2. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus.
Although a larger sum appears to have been offered as rent for the public land
in question, still the lease should not be declared void under the pretext of
this increase, especially when you state that a considerable time has elapsed
since the contract was made.
3. The Emperor Leo.
Where a house acquired through an inheritance, a legacy, a trust, or a
donation, or any supply of grain, or any buildings, or slaves come within the
jurisdiction of this renowned Capital, or of any other city of the Empire, it
shall be lawful for the municipality entitled to said property to enter into a
contract of sale to its own advantage, and the highest price possible having
been obtained at said sale, the proceeds shall be expended for the repair or
construction of public edifices.
We, intending diligently to provide for the interests of cities, and to prevent
persons from doing anything to their disadvantage, and
desiring such sales to proceed without the commission of fraud, corrupt
bargaining, or connivance of any description, do hereby decree that if anyone
should hereafter sell to this glorious City a house, civil supplies, or any
buildings or slaves whatsoever belonging to others, this shall not be done
unless by the authority of the Emperor.
Moreover, in the provinces, all, or a majority of the decurions, or of the
officials, or the owners of land in the city, to whom the property aforesaid
belongs, shall be present; and We order that after the Imperial document
authorizing the sale has been produced, each one of them shall give his opinion
as to what he thinks to be beneficial to his country, so that, finally, by
reading the decree in the presence of the proper authorities, the purchaser may
obtain a good title.
We decree that contracts of sale made in this manner, whether they are
completed at the time, or are perfected subsequently, shall be valid.
TITLE XXXII.
CONCERNING THE DEBTORS OP CITIES.
1. The Emperor Antoninus.
It has been established by My Constitutions, as well as by those of the Divine
Emperors, My predecessors, that a debtor to the government cannot be invested
with any official honor before he has discharged his indebtedness.
2. The Emperor Constantine to Verinus.
You should see that the funds of cities are loaned to persons who are solvent,
or whose heirs retain the estates of their fathers intact, provided they pay
the interest annually at the very time when it is due, as it is advantageous to
the State to have debtors who are solvent, and it is beneficial to the latter
that the amount of their indebtedness should not be increased. And, for the
reason that it is wrong for losses to be sustained by cities, through the
alienations of corporate bodies indebted to them, it has been decided that if
any debtor of a city should give away, sell, or otherwise dispose of to another
any part of the property of which he was possessed at the time when he borrowed
the public money, the nature of the property alienated and the entire fortune
of the debtor, which he possessed at the time that the money was lent to him,
being taken into consideration, the principal and interest of the debt can be
collected from him who obtained anything from the estate of the debtor in
proportion to what he received.
Therefore, whenever the estate of such a debtor is found to be insolvent, and a
claim is held against it by any city, the judge must use all diligence and
exert every effort to ascertain to whom the property of the debtor has been
transferred, so that each of the parties, after an equitable estimate has been
made, can be sued in proportion to the amount of the property of which he has
possession, and he will be entitled to a personal action against the debtor
aforesaid, who has been released from liability, by the payments which have
been made.
The person to whom the greater portion of his property is proved to have been
transferred by the debtor will have the right to demand the transfer of the
remainder, in order that, by so doing, he may become
solvent.
It is clear that if any debtor to the city should surrender his property to Our
Treasury, those who purchase it from the Treasury cannot, in accordance with
the ancient law and the Imperial Rescripts and Constitutions, be compelled to
suffer any annoyance. But if the debtor should not do this, or if he has
squandered all his property, so that no one can have possession of any of it,
the loss of the debt must then be sustained by the government; and therefore
the authorities of cities should be careful to lend their money to persons who
are solvent, or are the owners of rustic estates.
Published on the third of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of
Volusianus and Annianus, 314.
TITLE XXXIII.
CONCERNING THE LIABILITY OP THOSE WHO MAKE APPOINTMENTS.
1. The Emperor Gordian.
Although you did not require those who were appointed magistrates by you and
your colleague to furnish sureties, still, if they were solvent at the time
when they relinquished the honor of the magistracy, they did not, for that
reason, render you liable for any accidental circumstance by which the value of
their estates was reduced, as those who could have sued them in the public
name, and neglected to do so at the time when they retired from office, must
only blame themselves, and make good the loss sustained by the State if it
occurred through their fault.
2. The Emperor Philip and the Csesar Philip.If the successor of your successor
did not appoint a solvent magistrate in his place, the responsibility for his
administration can, by no means, attach to you personally; for one is only
compelled to assume responsibility for the successor whom he himself appointed,
and the power of the law does not extend to the appointment of one who, in £
his turn, was appointed by another.
TITLE XXXIV.
CONCERNING THE LIABILITY OF THOSE WHO BECOME SURETIES FOR MAGISTRATES.
1. The Emperor Antoninus.
It has been decided by Me, as well as by My Father, the Divine Severus, that
the sureties of magistrates are only responsible for the administration of
those for whom they become liable, so far as matters
pertaining to the management of their office are concerned, and not for any
penalties which they may have incurred through negligence or crime.
TITLE XXXXXXVV..IN WHAT ORDER PERSONS MUST BE SUED.
1. The Emperor Antoninus.
Although the care of money belonging to a city may have been committed to two
persons, still, each of them is not liable to it merely for the portion which
he received, but in full. Moreover, when the State demands indemnity, the
property of him who transacted the business shall first be taken, and then (if
it is not sufficient to satisfy the claim) recourse must be had to his
colleague.
Although you are the heirs of one of the city officials, it is not reasonable
that you should be liable where, after the death of your principal, any fraud
or negligence has been committed by his colleagues.
2. The Emperor Gordian.
Whenever an official duty is imposed upon two persons, not separately but
jointly, and in such a way that each of them is considered responsible in full,
recourse cannot, under any law, be had to the person who made the appointment,
before the pecuniary resources of both of those who administered the office are
formally ascertained to have been exhausted.
Where, however, they were appointed to administer different branches of the
same employment, each should be held liable for that part of the office of
which he had charge; and the same rule applies to their sureties. But when
indemnity cannot be obtained from them, then recourse should be had to him who
appointed them, and if he should prove unable to discharge the indebtedness,
the Governor will not be ignorant of the fact that each of the officials is
liable for the acts of the other.
3. The Same Emperor.
If you have been created duumvirs, under the express condition that you should
be equally responsible for one another, there can be no doubt that you are each
liable for the other's acts, as it has been established that in case of the
appointment of magistrates, recourse should first be had to those who made the
appointment. And you understand that this rule must also be observed where We,
Ourselves, are personally interested.
4. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian.
As you allege that you and your colleague, while in office, lent the public
money at interest, and some of the claims cannot be collected from certain
debtors to the State, and as you are ready to make good the loss growing out of
any transaction in which you alone were concerned, the result will be that if
the administrations of you and your
colleague were distinct, recourse can be had to the successors of the latter,
or to the persons now in possession of his property. And if the State should
not be entirely indemnified, those who appointed him can be sued, and finally
if anything should remain unpaid by your colleague, you will be responsible for
negligence, since it has been decided that those who first made the nomination
are liable as sureties.
TITLE XXXVI.
No FREEMAN CAN BE COMPELLED TO PERFORM THE FUNCTIONS OF A MUNICIPAL SERVANT.
1. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus.
If, as you allege, you obtained your freedom by a decree of the decurionate,
you should not be obliged to serve the city against your consent, and the
municipal curator will remember this fact, especially as slaves are required to
perform this duty.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian.
If you, being freeborn, should be compelled by the city to discharge the duty
of a servant, you can invoke the aid of the Governor and the protection of the
law, as far as custom authorizes this to be done.
TITLE XXXVII.
THE EXPENSES OF THE OFFICE TO WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN APPOINTED MUST BE BORNE BY
ALL THE INCUMBENTS OF SAID OFFICE.
1. The Emperor Maximian.
As you state that you, with others, have been appointed to administer the
office of Superintendent of Couriers, and that you alone have discharged the
duties of the same, having been deserted by your colleagues; any expense which
you may have incurred should, by a decree of the Governor, be divided
proportionately among all who are required to share in the administration of
the office. He will not be ignorant of your liability to public censure, if he
should ascertain that you, also, have been derelict in the performance of your
duty.
TITLE XXXVIII.
CONCERNING THOSE AGAINST WHOM LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
ARE INSTITUTED ON ACCOUNT OF THE OFFICE WHICH
THEY HAVE ADMINISTERED.
1. The Emperor Antoninus.
As the money belonging to the city, which was lent at interest, was not lost
through your fault, it is sufficient for you to be responsible for the
principal, and not for the interest.
TITLE XXXXXXIIXX..
CONCERNING THE PAYMENTS AND RELEASES OP DEBTORS TO THE STATE.
1. The Emperor Alexander to the Quatuorvirs and Decurions of the Fabretanians.
Receipts given by public slaves only release debtors from liability when they
are countersigned by the treasurer, or are approved by the authority of those
having the right to make the collections.
Moreover, he who is said to have made payment, and can produce the receipt of
the person to whom the money was given, is only considered to have a good
defence, if he is able to show that what he paid was placed in the Treasury of
the City. If it should be proved that your curator, assisted by the fraud of
the slave, intercepted any money paid by the debtors, the slave shall be
compelled to refund the amount lacking out of his own peculium.
TITLE XL. CONCERNING EXHIBITIONS, ACTORS, AND PROCURERS.
1. The Emperor Constantine.
We do not discourage public diversions, but, on the other hand, exhort citizens
to re-establish the exhibitions of strength and skill in the arena. And,
besides, as officials desire to render themselves popular by considering the
tastes and pleasures of the people, We the more readily permit them to do so,
provided they bear the expense.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Valens, Consul
for the fifth time, and Valentinian, 376.
2. The Emperors Oration, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Valerian, Prefect of
Illyria.
Your Highness should be aware that those persons who occupy themselves in
raising disturbances should be subjected to no other punishment but that of
engaging in combats in the circus.
Given on the eighth of the Idesof May, during the Consulate of Eucherius and
Syagrius, 381.
3. The Same Emperors to Valerian, Prefect of the City.
Anyone who uses for his private profit or convenience the horses which We,
Ourselves, or the ordinary consuls, have set apart for the public races, shall
be fined one pound of gold.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Eucherius and
Syagrius, 381.
4. The Emperors Theodosius, Arcadius, and Honorius to Rufinus, Prsetorian
Prefect.
If the portrait of a buffoon in short garments, or one of a charioteer with
wrinkled breast, or of a vile actor, should be placed in the
public porticoes, or anywhere in the city in which Our statues are usually
erected, it shall immediately be removed; nor shall it, hereafter, ever be
lawful for the representations of such degraded persons to be exhibited in
respectable places. We do not, however, forbid such pictures to be set up at
the entrance of the theatre or circus.
Given at Heraclea, on the third of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of
Arcadius, Consul for the third time, and Honorius, Consul for the second time,
396,
5. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Anthemius, Prsetorian Prefect.
No person in authority shall permit chariot-horses, charioteers, wild animals,
actors, or citizens to be conducted from one city to another, or from one
province to another, lest, while they are intem-perately soliciting popular
applause, they may interfere with the transaction of public business, and
interrupt the celebration of public festivals in the towns; and anyone who
fails to obey this regulation will be liable to the penalty imposed upon
violators of the law.
Given at Constantinople, on the eighth of the Idesof August, during the
Consulate of Honorius, Consul for the eighth time, and Theodosius, Consul for
the third time, 409.
6. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Florentius, Prsetorian Prefect.
We do not suffer either fathers or masters who, acting as procurers, impose
upon their daughters or female slaves the necessity of prostituting themselves,
to enjoy the right of ownership of property, or to claim immunity for such a
crime. It is therefore decided that, as the result of Our indignation, they
shall not possess any authority over their daughters or slaves, and that
nothing can be acquired for them by their instrumentality; and any slaves and
daughters, whom poverty has reduced to such an humble condition, shall be
permitted to implore the aid of bishops, judges, and defenders of the city, if
they desire to do so, in order to be released from the necessity of pursuing
this
wretched calling.
If their procurers aforesaid should think that they have the right to compel or
require them, against their will, to continue in their disgraceful occupation,
they shall not only lose the power which they had over them, but their property
shall be confiscated, and they shall be sentenced to the public mines.
This penalty is less severe than that imposed where a woman is forced by a
procurer to indulge in promiscuous sexual intercourse without her consent.
Given on the eleventh of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate
of Felix and Taurus, 428.
TITLE XLI. CONCERNING THE EXPENSES OF GAMES.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian.
As you say that the Governor of the province has applied the funds which were
intended for public exhibitions to the repair of the walls of the city, what
has been done for the general welfare cannot be revoked by Us, but the regular
performances of the arena shall take place in accordance with ancient custom,
after the repairs of the walls have been completed. For in this way, by
strengthening the walls, provision is made for the defence of the city, and
those matters which have reference to the public safety having been
accomplished, the games can be celebrated afterwards.
TITLE XLII. CONCERNING AQUEDUCTS.
1. The Emperor Constantine to the Consular, Maximilian.
We desire that the owners of land through which canals pass shall be exempt
from extraordinary charges, in order that their labors may keep the aqueduct
clear of filth of every description, and no other requirement shall be imposed
on the possessors of said land to prevent them from occupying themselves with
other matters, and taking care to keep the channels of the aqueduct in good
condition. If they should fail to do this, they shall be punished with the loss
of their property, for the Treasury will obtain the land of him through whose
negligence the aqueduct became obstructed.
Moreover, all such persons are hereby notified to plant trees at intervals of
fifteen feet on both sides of the aqueduct traversing their premises; and it
shall be the duty of the judge to see that these trees are cut down, if at any
time they should sprout, to prevent their roots from injuring the aqueduct.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of
Gallicanus and Symmachus, 330.
2. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Pan-cratius, Prefect
of the City.
If anyone should hereafter be so insolent as to attempt to interfere with the
convenience of this Most Flourishing City, "by conducting water on his own land
from a public aqueduct, he is hereby notified that the said land will be
confiscated, and added to Our private domain.
Given at Constantinople, on the eighth of . . . , during the Consulate of
Timasius and Promotus, 389.
3. The Same Emperors to Albinus, Prefect of the City of Rome.
We order that those to whom a supply of water has been either formerly or
recently granted by Our indulgence shall obtain the same from the reservoir, or
from the springs themselves, and that they shall
not take it from the principal canals, so as to divert their course, or
diminish the amount; nor shall they draw it from the aqueduct itself.
If anyone should do otherwise, he shall not only forfeit the privilege which he
formerly enjoyed, but shall be severely punished, according to his personal
status.
Given at Rome, on the fifth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of
Timasius and Promotus, 389.
4. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Astorius, Count of the
East.
We decree that the use of water, based upon ancient and well-established
ownership, shall continue to be enjoyed by citizens entitled to the same, and
that they shall not be disturbed by any innovation; provided, however, that
each one takes the same amount of water which he was allowed in former times,
and that he takes it in the same way. Those who, by the use of secret canals,
abuse their privilege for the purpose of irrigating their fields, or adding to
the attractions of their gardens, shall be punished.
Given on the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of Cse-
sarius and Atticus, 397.
5. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian.
If anyone, through the generosity of the Emperor, should obtain the right to
use water, he must have the written authority to do so registered, not by the
illustrious Governor of the province, but by Your Excellency, and anyone who
attempts to have it registered by the Governor shall be punished with a fine of
fifty pounds of gold, and the same penalty shall be imposed upon this official,
if he accepts a rescript conferring such a privilege, when it has been
surreptitiously obtained. The subordinates of the said Governor shall also be
subjected to punishment by Your Highness. In addition to this, You must
determine the quantity of water, both hot and cold, which should be devoted to
the service of the public baths, in proportion to the number of citizens who
use them, as well as the amount of superfluous water to which those persons to
whom We have granted the privilege shall be entitled.
6. The Same Emperors.
Every servitude permitting water to be drawn from the aqueduct of Hadrian,
whether for domestic use, for the irrigation of land, for country villas, or
for baths, either by virtue of an Imperial Rescript, or secured by usurpation,
is hereby absolutely abolished; for We prefer that the aforesaid aqueduct
should be used to provide water for the public, hot and cold baths, and for Our
palace.
We decree that this law shall, by all means, be observed hereafter, and that
permission shall be granted to no one, in answer to a petition, to take water
from the said aqueduct, nor shall anyone venture to pierce it for that purpose.
All persons who, for any reason whatsoever, may think that they are entitled to
this privilege (or any official who dares to grant it, or even receive a
petition for that purpose), are hereby notified that they will be fined a
hundred pounds of gold for the
benefit of the Treasury. We order that no trees shall be planted within ten
feet of a public aqueduct, but that, on each side of the same, the space of ten
feet shall remain unoccupied and unobstructed.
Moreover, We decree that the same rule shall be observed with reference to the
leaden pipes which conduct water to the hot baths, called by the name of
Achilles, which We have learned that Your Highness has erected; for We desire
that the above-mentioned pipes shall only be used for providing the hot and
cold baths with water, which is the purpose for which you intended them.
Your Highness must also give authority to your subordinates to exercise
supervision over houses, suburban villas, and baths, without running any risk,
in order to prevent deception from being practiced, or suppression, or any
other illegal act from being committed by anyone against the public welfare, so
far as the use of water is concerned.
7. The Same Emperors.
All taxes on ladders which can be collected, as well as those paid by the
laborers called zizaceni,shall be employed for the repair of the aqueducts of
this Renowned City. It should also be observed that none of those who have the
right to use the water shall be subjected to any expense for repairs, as it
would be abominable for the inhabitants of this Beautiful City to be compelled
to purchase water.
8. The Emperor Zeno.
We order, by this law, that if any Urban Prefect should convert to other
purposes money provided for the construction or maintenance of aqueducts, he
shall be compelled to refund the amount out of his own property to be used for
the said aqueducts.
A separate treasurer shall be appointed to receive the money provided by the
illustrious Consuls, which has been donated by their liberality, or has been,
or may hereafter, be obtained from other sources to insure a supply of water
for the public.
9. The Same Emperor to Poratias.
We decree that careful investigation shall be made of fountains which were
originally public, as well as those which, derived from private sources, have
afterwards become public and then been converted to the use of private
individuals, as well as of such as have been surreptitiously obtained by
Imperial Rescripts; and, by all means, where a privilege of this kind is known
to have been secured unlawfully, and not under the pretext of Imperial
sanction, so that its rights may be restored to the Capital, and what was once
public shall not become private, but shall be devoted to the use of the entire
community.
Imperial Rescripts or pragmatic sanctions which have been obtained by any
persons, contrary to the welfare of the City, should be declared illegal and
void; nor can any prescription of long time be advanced for the purpose of
curtailing the rights of the City.
10. The Same Emperor to Pentius.
We decree that nothing shall be done by anyone, no matter what his rank, for
the purpose of interfering with the smaller aqueducts, or
the public fountains which flow into them. Whoever, either secretly or openly,
relying upon his authority, diverts any of the water from the said branches of
the aqueduct or fountains, or clandestinely takes water from the public
aqueducts, shall be compelled to make complete restitution of the same.
We also order that hereafter no trees whatever shall be planted near the said
aqueducts, in order that the walls of the latter may not be ruined by their
roots. The prohibition is known to have been established by the ancient
constitutions, and all persons are notified that, hereafter, any villa, field,
bath, mill, or garden in which public water is used, or in or about which trees
have been planted by the owner thereof which may injure the aqueduct, will
subject the man or the building to proscription, and his property shall be
confiscated to the Treasury. This penalty shall not be revoked even by an
Imperial Rescript.
Again, We decree that all inspectors and guardians of water, who are styled
hydrophylacs,who are appointed to have supervision of the aqueducts of this
Imperial City, shall bear Our name stamped upon their hands for the purpose of
identification, so that by this means they may be known to all, and not be
called upon to perform other services, either by the Stewards of Our Household,
or by anyone else, and be employed as couriers, or discharge various public
duties.
When any of said water-inspectors dies, We order that whoever is summoned to
take his place shall be designated with the same mark, so that, being thus
associated in a common service, they must exercise constant vigilance for the
preservation of the water, and not occupy themselves with other matters.
11. The Emperor Justinian to Servus, Prsetorian Prefect.
We order, by this law, that the Divine Constitution promulgated by the Emperor
Theodosius, of illustrious memory, with reference to those who wish to obtain
the right to take water from the public fountains, shall be confirmed, so that
no one, either in this Most Holy City, or in the provinces, shall be permitted
to draw water from any public aqueduct or fountain without a special permit
issued by the Emperor in the usual manner, and duly recorded, either by Your
Highness, or by other officials having authority to do so.
Those who violate this law, or permit it to be done, shall not only be
condemned to pay a fine of ten pounds of gold, but shall also be severely
punished.
TITLE XLIII. CONCERNING GLADIATORS.
1. The Emperor Constantine to Maximus, Praetorian Prefect.Sanguinary
exhibitions are not proper in the midst of civil tranquillity and domestic
peace, for which reason We absolutely prohibit gladiatorial contests.1
1 The gladiatorial combats of Rome, bloody and brutal though they were,
constituted the favorite amusement of both the nobles and the populace, a
conclusive
Published at Berytus, on the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of
Paulinus and Julian, 325.
TITLE XLIV. CONCERNING THE CHASE OF WILD BEASTS.
1. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Maurianus, Count of the Domestics.
We grant permission to everyone to kill lions, and no one shall have any fear
of prosecution on this account. Moreover, We order that wild beasts which are
sent by the dukes of frontiers to Us cannot, while on the way, be kept in any
city longer than seven days. The violators of this law shall pay a fine of five
pounds of gold to the Treasury.
proof of national decadence and degeneracy. A tendency to reversion to the
primal state of savagery is indicated by the fact that these contests owed
their origin to the human sacrifices which, among the barbarous tribes of
Europe, once formed part of the obsequies of distinguished persons. Early known
to, and practiced by the Greeks, this custom was transmitted by the Etrurians,
from whom the Romans, in their turn, derived it. The celebration of the rite,
which subsequently became a pastime, was supposed to propitiate the Manes,
departed spirits and tutelary deities of families, whose thirst for blood was
one of their most prominent attributes. So important was its observance
considered that wealthy persons often bequeathed large sums of money to be
expended for this purpose.
These games were, at first, under the charge of the Eediles, but, afterwards,
special officials were designated to provide for and superintend their
presentation, which, having developed from a private ceremony into a public and
official function, was then transferred from the vicinity of the funeral pyre
to the Forum and the amphitheatre. On grand occasions, and when the number of
combatants was unusually large, the Circus Maximus, with its seating capacity
of three hundred and eighty-five thousand, was the scene of this thrilling but
repulsive spectacle. By means of it, personal popularity and political
preferment were eagerly sought by both demagogues and statesmen, who combined
the expectation of future, selfish advantage with the present, pious discharge
of filial or paternal duty. Csesar, on his accession to the office of curule
ajdile, in honor of the memory of his father, exhibited three hundred and
twenty pairs of gladiators clad in magnificent armor embossed and inlaid with
gold. Augustus, in his will, declared that he had caused ten thousand to fight
during his reign; Trajan, however, exhausted the same number of contestants for
life and death in the short space of twenty-three days.
There were no less than fifteen different classes of gladiators, who were
distinguished by their weapons, armor, dress, equipment, nationality, and mode
of battle. Regular schools were established for their instruction; their
teachers, or lanistse,directed their operations in the arena; they were
solemnly sworn "to be burned, conquered, scourged, put to death by the sword,
or whatever the master, to whom we, as regular gladiators, devote ourselves
body and soul, may command."
Gladiators were, at first, solely composed of captives, slaves, and condemned
criminals. They constituted a distinct caste, and their antecedents caused them
to be regarded with contempt even by the lower orders of the populace. Their
fine physique, feats of strength, skill, and daring, nevertheless, acquired for
them the covert, or even open admiration of the gentler sex, accustomed to the
scenes of blood and horror inseparable from the exercise of their profession.
The susceptible Roman damsels, ardent worshippers of force like all their
sisters, in the decadent days of the Empire lavished gifts and caresses upon
these social outcasts, to whose barbarous origin and former crimes they were
willingly blind. To them
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of
Constantius and Constans; and also at Constantinople, on the fifth of the
Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of Our Lord Honorius, Consul for the
eleventh time, and Constantius, Consul for the second time, 417.
TITLE XLV. CONCERNING THE MAY FESTIVAL.
1. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Csesarius, Prsetorian
Prefect.
We have decided that the May Festival shall be re-established for the benefit
of the people of the provinces, provided that decency be observed, and modesty
and chastity be maintained.1
the successful gladiator was "Suspirium"or "Decus puellamm;""Him whom girls
sigh for," or "admire;" and his intrigues with high-born maidens were the
scandal of a capital already infamous for its monstrous and unbridled
profligacy.
While participants in contests in the arena were looked upon with disdain by
respectable Romans, this was not the case in early Greece, where men of the
highest rank measured their strength and prowess against one another in the
Olympic Games. This deep-rooted prejudice was subsequently, to a certain extent
removed, and under the Empire it was not unusual for senators, as well as
members of the equestrian order, voluntarily to take part in these combats, to
which no magistrate or tribunal had authority to sentence them by way of
penalty. The better class of citizens, however, considered this practice as
deplorable and disgraceful. "Feminarum in lustrium senatorumque plures per
arenam fcedati sunt."(Tacitus, AnnalesXV, 32.)
As disclosed by the famous Roman historian, certain womenwho in our age would
be referred to as "champions of advanced ideas"did not hesitate to don the
martial panoply of battle, and temporarily unsex themselves in their eagerness
for excitement and notoriety. Their efforts to this end, while not encouraged,
do not seem to have been disapproved by the officials in charge of the public
games. In common with the male competitors for popular applause, they were
compelled to obey the commands of the lanista,or gladiatorial trainer. "Nan dum
valida ac juvenilia membra Sufficiunt galese, dumque ardent sanguine, fertur,
Non cogente quidem, sed non prohibento tribuno, Scripturus leges et regis verba
lanistse,"
(Juvenal, SatiresXI, 8.)
Although, at the instigation of the Christian clergy, many attempts were made
by Constantine and some of his successors to suppress gladiatorial exhibitions
by means of laws, edicts, and proclamations, still their hold on popular favor
was so powerful as to render these efforts fruitless, and it was not until the
reign of Justinian that they were actually and permanently abolished throughout
the Roman world.ED.
1 The celebration of the day sacred to Maia, the mother of Mercury, and Flora,
the goddess of flowers, associated largely with sex worship and the annual
regeneration of Nature, one of the most beautiful and attractive festivals of
antiquity, survived for many centuries in the holiday observance of the first
of May in Europe, whose erotic and Priapic character is disclosed by the
erection of the lofty pole garlanded with flowersa purely phallic
symbolaround which village maidens in their best attire danced the livelong
day, profoundly ignorant of the origin or signification of the object in whose
honor their charms and graces were dis-. played, and which was the silent and
unappreciative recipient of their devoted homage.ED.
Given at Constantinople, on the seventh of the Kalendsof May, during the
Consulate of Arcadius, Consul for the fourth time, and Honorius, Consul for the
third time, 196.
TITLE XLVI.
THE USE OF ARMS WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE EMPEROR Is FORBIDDEN.
1. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Buleforus, Consular of Campania.
No one shall, hereafter, without Our knowledge and consent, have the right to
bear arms of any description whatever.
Given on the third of the Nonesof October, during the Consulate of the Divine
Jovian and Varronian, 364.
TITLE XLVII.
CONCERNING FARMERS, TENANTS OF LAND REGISTERED ON THE CENSUS,1 AND SERFS.
1. The Emperor Constantine.
Farmers engaged in sowing seed or gathering their crops shall not be subjected
to extraordinary civil burdens, in order that proper time may be given them for
performing their necessary labors.
2. The Emperor Constantine to Dulcitius, Consular of Emilia.
When anyone wishes to sell or donate land, he cannot retain for himself the
serfs attached to it, nor can he by any private agreement transfer them
elsewhere. For those who think that serfs are an advantage should either keep
them on the land, or relinquish them to those to whom it has been sold, if they
themselves do not expect to obtain any benefit for the land alone.
Given at Milan, on the third of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of
Constantius, Consul for the ninth time, and Julianus, Consul for the second
time, 357.
3. The Emperor Valentinian and Valens to Faventius, Vicegerent of Italy.
Anyone who, through Our liberality, obtains vagrant slaves from deserted lands
will, on this account, be liable to the Treasury for the annual payment of the
same amount of rent which the Treasury formerly received from the land to which
the slaves were recently attached.
1 These were possessors of land under a tenure in some respects similar to that
of copyhold at Common Law, known to the Saxons as Bockland (or "Book-land"),
which was called "base" by the old English jurists on account of its being held
subject to the performance of villein services. (VideBracton, De Legibus et
Consuetudinibus AnglixII, Vill, 26; Fleta, Commentarius Juris AnglicaniI, 8;
Britton, De Juribus Anglicanis165; Littleton, Tenures X; Coke, Institutes I,
58a.)ED.
We desire that this rule shall also apply to those who have permitted slaves of
this kind to settle on their own land.
Given at Milan, on the day before the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of
Valentinian and Valens, 365.
4. The Same Emperors to Modestus.
Owners of land are notified that either they or their agents will be compelled
to pay the tribute originally imposed upon the serfs, in the places from which
they came. We decree that those shall be excepted from this rule who are the
owners of land, no matter what may be its value, and who have been registered
in their own names as owners in the office of the census; for it is proper that
they themselves should pay the tribute in grain to the regular collector, in
proportion to the amount of their possessions.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Gratian
and Dagalaifus, 366.
5. The Same Emperors to Orients.
The owners of land shall only exact from their serfs what it pro-. duces, and
they must not collect their rent in money, which rustics need not pay unless
the custom of the country requires it.
6. The Same Emperors and Gratian to Germanus.
The Governors of provinces shall compel all fugitive serfs, whether attached to
the glebe or not, as well as tenants without distinction of sex, occupation, or
status, to return to the land where they are registered, and have been born and
reared.
7. The Same Emperors to Maximus.
Just as it is not lawful for serfs attached to the soil to be sold separately,
so rustic slaves and registered serfs shall, by no means, be disposed of in
this way. Nor can anyone fraudulently evade this law (which has often been done
in the past with respect to serfs attached to the glebe) by conveying a small
portion of the land to the purchaser, and transferring therewith all the slaves
belonging to the entire tract; but where all the land, or a certain part of the
same is sold to anyone, the same proportion of slaves and serfs shall pass with
it, and the corresponding number of the same shall either be delivered or
remain with the former owners or possessors. If the purchaser should disobey
this law, he must consider the price which he paid as lost, and the vendor
shall, nevertheless, have a right to recover the slaves with any offspring they
may have.
If the vendor should, for any reason, decline to take advantage of this
provision, and die without having done so, We grant the right of recovery to
his heirs against those of the purchaser, without permitting prescription for
long time to be pleaded, for no one can entertain any doubt that he is a
possessor in bad faith who has bought anything contrary to the provisions of
the laws.
8. The Same Emperors to Probus.
All fugitive serfs who conceal themselves upon the land of another shall be
recovered, together with the tribute which they owe, that is to say, if those
in whose possession the slaves are found know that they were fugitives, and
belonged to someone else, and were used for his own benefit, in other words, if
they cultivated land the crops of which were to be given to the owners, or any
other services were exacted of them, and they did not obtain any compensation
for their labor, the tribute imposed upon them and which was lost by the
Government shall be collected from the proprietor of the land.
Where, however, the fugitives concealed the fact that they were of servile
condition, and represented themselves to be free when they applied to another
person, and cultivated land for the purpose of giving only a portion of the
crops to the owner of the same, reserving the remainder for their own
peculium,or if they received a fixed salary for the performance of certain
services, any tribute which may be due to the government shall be collected
from the fugitives themselves; for it is clear that a private contract was
made. But when any debtors are found among these fugitives (as is usually the
case where men of this kind are engaged in commercial transactions), the judge
shall compel what is due to be paid by those who are liable to the creditors
entitled to the same.
9. The Same Emperors to the People.
Exemptions which have been specially granted, that is to say, of both land and
personal taxes accorded by the municipal magistrates or Governors of provinces,
are hereby annulled, and those who enjoy them shall be returned to their former
condition.
Given at Milan, on the third of the Nonesof March, during the Consulate of
Merobaudus, Consul for the second time, and Saturninus, 383.
10. The Same Emperors to Cynegius, Prsetorian Prefect.
Formerly the rule with reference to the poll-tax was that it should be imposed
upon every man, and every two women; it shall now be imposed upon every two or
three men, or every four women. Therefore, Your Highness will order the amounts
of this tax as above indicated to be justly and properly inscribed on the
public registers, in the country of the Comanenses, in that of the Ariatensians
and Second Armenia, in the country of the Amasenes, in Helenopontus, in the
country of the Diocaesareans, and in Second Cappadocia.
11. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius.
We decree that original serfs shall be exempt through no privilege, dignity, or
authority, but that all the rights which have been at any time obtained by them
through favor shall be abrogated, and that they shall be restored to their
owner, or to the land to which they were attached.
12. The Same Emperors to Florentinus.
We desire that slaves, tributary serfs, or tenants shall remain with their
masters, for as all of them are apprehensive of punishment, a slave would have
no desire to flee, if he did not know with whom he could take refuge. For no
slave would abandon his master if he was not aware where he could conceal
himself, and every person should receive only those strangers whom he is
convinced are freeborn, and he should, through dread of becoming amenable to
the laws, decline to entertain anyone who merely asserts that he is free.
Therefore, if one of the above-mentioned fugitives should be found, he who is
harboring him shall pay twelve pounds of gold to Our Treasury; and We order
that he must not only return the fugitive to his master, but also give him
another slave of the same value, in addition.
13. The Same Emperors to Vicentius.
We decree that, so far as the origin of tenants and serfs is concerned, they
shall be considered as of the same condition, even though their names may
differ; and any children born to them shall follow the condition of their
father.
(1) The following rule must also be observed. Where a man is the owner of two
tracts of land, one of which has more serfs than are required for its
cultivation, he can transfer those which are not needed to the tract which is
deficient; and if the said tracts should be conveyed to different persons, the
transfer of the serfs above mentioned shall stand, but the owner of the land
from whom they were taken must restore their relatives to them.
14. The Same Emperors to Vicemtius.
If serfs that are held by anyone in good faith flee and take refuge with
others, and then attempt to deny their status, they must first be returned to
the possessor in good faith, and then the case of their birth and ownership can
be determined.
15. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius.
No collector of debts owing to the Treasury shall ever, in the name of their
masters, molest serfs who are indebted to it, for the reason that We declare
that serfs are so absolutely attached to the glebe that they should not be
removed therefrom for a single instant of time.
16. The Same Emperors to Palladius.
Where a woman, who is shown to be a serf by birth, marries a freeman in any
city or place whatsoever, it has been decided by the ancient laws that all her
offspring will follow her condition.
17. The Same Emperors to John.
It is declared by jurisconsults that nothing which can, in any way, prejudice
the title of the land to which a serf is attached, shall be done by him without
the knowledge or consent of the owner.
18. This Law is Not Authentic.
19. The Emperor Valentinian.
We do not, under any circumstances, permit serfs to be admitted into the army,
nor do We grant them the privilege of serving as aids to commanders, because,
in this instance, We take into consideration not only the rights of their
masters, but also the honor of the public service.
20. The Emperor Justinian to Demosthenes, Praetorian Prefect.
With a view to accelerating the progress of litigation, We order that when
serfs, of any class whatsoever, dispute the title of their master to the land
which they cultivate, and We are in doubt on the point whether the master is
the owner of the land or not, or whether the serfs themselves are entitled to
the ownership of the same, it is hereby decreed in such cases that the serfs
must furnish sufficient security before their claims can be heard, except where
their masters are unable to defend themselves by prescription of long time, and
the sureties furnished must guarantee that if the masters gain the case, they
will pay what is due to them.
A surety of this kind shall only be accepted for the term of three years, and,
at the expiration of that time, he must be replaced by another, and, in the
meanwhile, the serfs shall, under no circumstances, be annoyed by their masters
on account of any quitrent to which the latter may be entitled.
(1) Where, however, the serfs are either unwilling or unable to do this, then
the annual quitrent shall be exacted by the judge, at the usual time when it
was paid to the owners, and it shall either be deposited in a church or with
the magistrate of the city within whose jurisdiction the land is situated; or,
if the local church is not suitable for the deposit of the money, it shall with
every necessary precaution be placed in the metropolitan church, and after the
decision has been rendered, it must either be paid to the owners of the land,
or refunded to the serfs.
(2) Moreover, when the quitrent does not consist of money, but is either wholly
or in part paid by the delivery of a certain portion of the crops, the latter
must be sold by the court, and the proceeds of the same deposited in the manner
aforesaid.
(3) The above-mentioned provisions have reference to quitrent paid to the
owners of land, and We must now pass to the duties required by the State.
If the serfs themselves were in the habit of paying what was due to the
Treasury in a certain way, they shall continue to do so, without prejudice to
the owners of the land, who have no right to interfere with the discharge of
the indebtedness to the State, so long as the serfs remain quiet, and offer no
opposition. Where, however, it was the custom for the owners of the land to
receive the entire amount, and pay a portion of it to the Treasury, retaining
the remainder for themselves in satisfaction of their quitrent, then, if a
surety is fur-
nished by the serfs, he must guarantee the payment, not only of the ouitrent to
the owner, but also the tax due to the State, in order that the obligations of
the owners to the Treasury may be discharged. No prejudice shall, on this
account, result to the serfs, for the owners must remain content with the
security furnished with reference to the ouitrent to which they are entitled.
(4) Where, however, no security was furnished, but the property has been
sequestered and the money deposited, the judge shall take from the amount
sufficient for the payment of what is due to the Treasury, and the owner shall
be given receipts, just as if he himself had paid it, while the remainder due
for quitrent must be deposited in a safe place, until the termination of the
lawsuit.
No prejudice shall result either to the serfs or their masters (because of any
security of this kind) from the sequestration of the property, or the payment
of the sum due to the Treasury, but everything shall remain in suspense until a
decision has been rendered by the court disposing of the entire affair,
clearing up the whole controversy, and showing who was the owner of the land,
and to whom the receipts for what was due to the Treasury shall hereafter be
given, and to whom the quitrent shall be paid or belong.
Read seven times in the New Consistory of the Palace of Justinian.
Given . . . ,. during the Consulate of Decius, 529.
21. The Same Emperor to the Senate.
In order that it may no longer be doubted what is the status of a child born to
a female serf and a freeman, or to a female serf and a slave, or to a male serf
and a female slave, or whether the condition of the serf or a slave is rendered
worse, We order that what has been provided by former laws with reference to
children of this kind, who are the issue of female serfs and freemen, shall
remain unaltered; and therefore any issue of serfs shall follow the condition
of their mother.
If, however, a child should be born to a male slave and a female serf, or to a
female slave and a male serf, it shall follow the condition of its mother,
whether she was a slave or a serf, which rule has hitherto only been observed
with respect to free persons and slaves. For does any difference exist between
slaves and serfs, both being under the control of their masters, as a slave can
be manumitted with his peculium,and a serf be released from ownership along
with the land to which he is attached ?
22. The Same Emperor to Julianus, Praetorian Prefect.
As we are aware that our laws do not allow the rights of any one to be
prejudiced on account of his condition, either from his admissions, or because
of any written document, unless additional evidence is produced, We order that
an admission alone, or any private written paper shall not be sufficient to
decide whether or not a man is a serf, but that some other instrument in
writing, either taken from the public records or derived from some other source
recognized by law, must be offered for the purpose of confirming a document of
this kind. For, in the
settlement of such controversies, it is better for the condition of anyone to
be established by different proofs, and that men who, perhaps, are free, may
not be reduced to servitude, merely by admissions, or by the production of
private papers.
If, however, the writing should be confirmed by a subsequent admission, or a
deposition (made voluntarily, and without the employment of force, or as the
result of necessity), or if an instrument having reference to his status, or
any other public document, which had been recorded, should be produced in which
the party in question wrote, stated, and deposed that he was a serf, then the
result of all these combined proofs, that is to say, of the writing, the
admission, and the deposition, would be that the person who wrote and made the
solemn declaration aforesaid was what he represented himself to be.
(1) Again, a doubt, which is not unreasonable, formerly arose, where the son of
a serf had remained at liberty free for the term of thirty or forty years, or
even longer, while his father was still living, and cultivating the soil, and
the owner of the land, for the reason that he was satisfied with the services
of his father, did not require the presence of the son on his premises,
whether, after the death of the father or after he had become infirm, and
incapable of agricultural toil, his son could be excused on the ground of his
long-continued freedom; and, because for many years he had neither cultivated
the soil, nor performed any other of the labors of a serf, his master could
only blame his own neglect, as every duty which he required was performed by
his father.
In all cases of this kind, it seems to Us to be very harsh that the rights of
the master should be prejudiced by the absence of his serfs, who, having been
born on the land and afterwards being absent, cultivated it by means of either
their fathers, their brothers, or other relatives ; for as a portion of his
body remained upon the land in the form of his relatives, he should not be
considered either to have been absent, to have been on a journey, or to have
possessed his freedom. The rights of the owner shall therefore remain
unimpaired, and so long as the ascendants, descendants, or collaterals of the
serf shall remain on the land, he himself shall be considered to be there.
23. The Same to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
As it would be extremely unjust for land, which was in the beginning provided
with serfs, afterwards to be deprived of its members, as it were, and serfs
residing on the lands of others to cause serious loss to the owners of the
land, We decree that, as in the case of decurions, no one is released from his
obligations by lapse of time, so those belonging to the condition of serfdom
cannot be liberated by the passage of years; nor can anyone of this class claim
his freedom on account of any protracted negotiation, but he shall always
remain a serf, and be attached to the glebe; and if he should lie concealed, or
attempt to withdraw from the soil, he shall, like a fugitive slave, be
understood to have stolen himself by long-continued treachery, and shall remain
in this class, together with all his offspring (if he should have begotten
any upon the land of another), and shall be liable to the payment of quitrent,
from which he cannot be released by any act of generosity
whatsoever.
(1) Since the Anastasian Law provides that the children of anyone who has been
attached to land as a serf for thirty years shall remain there, and not have
the power to migrate elsewhere, the question arose '.whether the children of
either sexeven though they may not have remained for the term of thirty years
on the land or in the village should be considered serfs, or whether only
their father, who had belonged to this class, should, for that time, be
designated as such, We hereby order that the children of serfs shall, in
accordance with the terms of the above-mentioned law, remain forever free, and
cannot be reduced to an inferior condition; still, they shall not have
permission to leave the land and migrate elsewhere, but must always remain
attached to the soil which their fathers have cultivated.
Moreover, the owners of the land to which such serfs are attached must be
careful not to annoy them in any way, nor inflict any violence on them; but if
this should be proved to have been done, and a decision rendered by a judge to
that effect, the Governor of the province in which the act was perpetrated
shall see that the injury is atoned for (if any took place), and the ancient
custom with reference to the quit-rent is observed; and permission shall be
granted to the serfs to leave the places where they reside.
We decree that this rule shall apply not only to serfs themselves, but also to
their children of both sexes and of all ages, so that any who have been born
upon the land may remain there subject to the same regulations and conditions
under which We have prescribed that their parents should reside upon land owned
by others.
(2) Again, no one shall be permitted knowingly and deliberately to harbor on
his own premises any serf or dependent attached to the land of another. Where,
however, he has received him in good faith, and afterwards ascertains that
someone else is entitled to his services, or is notified of this fact by the
owner of the land, or the master of the serf, either in person or by his agent,
he must restore the serf with all his peculium,and his offspring. If he should
fail to do this, he shall be compelled to settle all claims due to the
Treasury, whether derived from the land, or payable annually, for which the
serf was liable during the time he remained with him. This shall be
accomplished by the care and diligence of the prefect and the Governor of the
province, by whom punishment shall be inflicted, and restitution shall be made
in accordance with the ancient constitutions.
24. The Same Emperor to John, Prsetoricm Prefect.We decree that, when male
serfs marry free women, no matter with what intention or by what contrivance,
either with or without the knowledge of their masters, the women as well as any
children who are known to have been born from such a marriage shall retain
their freedom. It should, however, undoubtedly be observed that where a child
ig'born to a free husband and a wife who is a serf, it will follow
the servile condition of the mother, and will not enjoy the freedom of its
father.
And, in order that serfs may not think that an attempt of this kind will go
unpunished (which is greatly to be feared), and that the condition of men of
this kind may not decrease little by little on account of their marriages with
free women, We decree that if any such act should be perpetrated by a male
serf, his master shall himself have full authority to punish him by the
imposition of a moderate penalty (or the Governor of the province can do so),
and separate him from the woman. If he should neglect to do this, he can only
blame his own negligence for any loss which he may sustain.
TITLE XLVIII.
CONCERNING THE EXEMPTION OF CITIZENS FEOM THE CAPITATION TAX.
1. The Emperors Constantine to Eusebius, Governor of Lycia and Pamphilia.
The people of the City of Rome (as is also the case in the provinces of the
East) shall not be subjected to the imposition of a poll-tax, but are by this
law entitled to exemption from the same.
Given on the Kalendsof June, during the third Consulate of Constantine and
Licinius, 313.
TITLE XLIX.
IN WHAT CASES REGISTERED SERFS CAN ACCUSE THEIR
MASTERS.
1. The Emperor Constantine.
Any serf, from whom more is exacted by his master than was required of him in
former times, and he was previously accustomed to pay, should appear before a
judge as soon as he can obtain access to him and prove the offence, so that he
who is convicted of having demanded more than he was in the habit of receiving
may be prohibited from doing so hereafter, having first restored what he is
known to have extorted by this illegal demand.
2. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius.
Serfs inscribed upon the register of the census are not subject to the same
tributes as those whose names are not enrolled thereon, but as they who are
compelled to make annual payments as the result of their condition are, to a
certain extent, in a state of servitude, it would be intolerable for them to be
permitted to institute legal proceedings against persons by whom there is no
doubt that they can be sold along with the land to which they are attached. We
shall hereafter deprive them of permission to do this, for no serf must dare to
bring his mas-
ter, to whom he and all his property are known to belong, into court, for it
has frequently been decided that a serf cannot, without the knowledge of his
master, sell, or alienate in any other way, the land to which he is attached,
just as he whom the laws do not permit to have any property of his own, and who
is not authorized to acquire or transfer it, and whom the laws only permit to
obtain and hold property for the benefit of his master, cannot appear against
the latter in court. Hence We exclude persons of this kind from appearing
against their masters or patrons in all civil proceedings, except in cases of
extortion, in which former Emperors have granted this privilege, and We also
deny them the right to prosecute the latter criminally by accusations of a
public character, except where some injury has been committed against them or
their relatives.
TITLE L. CONCERNING THE SERFS OF PALESTINE.
1. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens.
As the law promulgated by Our predecessors prescribes that serfs shall remain
in the condition in which they were born in all the other provinces subject to
Our Empire, so, in order that they may not be able to depart from those places
which they are engaged in cultivating, oorrabandon the soil which should always
be tilled by them, and as this does not apply to the owners of land in the
Province of Palestine, We now decree that no serf of Palestine shall have the
right to wander about, and boast that he is free, but shall, as in other
provinces, be subject to the proprietor of the land, so that he cannot depart
therefrom without being liable to punishment; and it is also added that full
authority to claim him is hereby granted to the said proprietor.
TITLE LI. CONCERNING THE SERFS OF THRACE.
1. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius.
The poll-tax is hereby forever abolished throughout the entire Province of
Thrace, and only the land tax shall be paid. And, in order that permission may
not appear to have been granted to serfs liable to tribute, to withdraw and
wander wherever they please, they themselves shall be retained in their
original condition; and, even though they may appear to be freeborn, they shall
still be considered to be attached to the land where they originated; nor shall
they have the power to go wherever they choose, or to change their residence,
but the owners of the land shall exercise over them the rights and care of
patrons and the authority of masters.
Moreover, if anyone should think he has the right to harbor or retain a serf,
he shall be compelled to pay two pounds of gold to him whose land the fugitive
serf abandoned, and he shall also surrender the latter, together with all his
peculiumand his children.
TITLE LII.
CONCERNING THE SERFS OF ILLYRIA.
1. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius.
We decree that the vassals and tenants of both Illyria and the neighboring
countries shall not have permission to abandon the land to which it is certain
that they are attached by origin and birth, but shall continue to cultivate it,
not on the condition of paying tribute, but under the name and appellation of
serfs; so that if they desert it and go elsewhere, after having been brought
back they can be placed in chains, and subjected to other punishment. The
penalties denounced against those who receive the serfs of others, even if they
are not known to be such, shall be enforced, and shall consist of indemnity for
the services which were lost, and the injury sustained by the place which they
abandoned, as well as of a fine, the amount of which We leave to the discretion
of the court; so that the owner of the land on which the serf is shown to have
been employed may be compelled to suffer punishment in proportion to the nature
of the offence; nor shall there be any ground for ignorance, as the mere fact
that he kept possession of a serf who was unknown to him will, of itself, be
sufficient to establish the offence.
Again, if anyone should receive a slave in any of the countries above
mentioned, he shall not be allowed to excuse himself through ignorance, but
will be liable to a penalty of fourfold damages; and, in addition, must make
good the losses sustained by the owner of the slave.
We decree that the same rule that We have prescribed concerning emancipated
serfs * shall be observed with reference to freedmen who are harbored in this
way.
1 The Romans divided tenants, in general, into two classes: inquilini,or lessee
of houses, and coloni,or lessees of land. The first of these terms was, for the
most part, applied to persons who rented property in towns or cities.
The primary and usual signification of colonuswas serf, otherwise designated
servus terras,or adscriptus glebss(one who is attached to the glebe). The
colonusoccupied an anomalous position in the eye of the law. He was nominally
free, enjoying the right to marry and make other valid contracts, was subject
to taxation, and could do many other things forbidden to a slave. Still his
liberty was far from absolute, as he was obliged to remain on the land where he
was born, and not only was he prohibited from leasing it, but his master could
not dispose of him separately, or even manumit him. He was, therefore, as his
name implies, practically a part of the soil upon which he performed his daily
toil. His children were also hereditary bondmen, and the offspring of a female
serf, like that of a slave, in accordance with the maxim "Partus sequitur
ventrem,"followed the condition of the mother.
While the colonuscould own personal property, he could not alienate it without
his master's consent.
He did not necessarily owe his status to the accident of birth. He might
voluntarily acquire it by announcing his intention before a competent tribunal,
and contracting marriage with a female of the class in which he desired to be
enrolled. The same rule was applicable to women. When once assumed, however,
the acquired status of the individual could 'never be renounced or abandoned.
TITLE LIII.
No ONE SHALL EXTEND PROTECTION TO PEASANTS OR SUPPORT THEM IN ANY CHANGES WHICH
THEY MAY
MAKE.
1. The Emperor Leo to Eryfh/rius, Praetorian Prefect.
If anyone, after the publication of this law, should, for the purpose of
defrauding the State out of any tax or obligation which is due, claim the
protection of a person of rank, whatever has been enacted on this
It was often found to be a convenient and profitable manner of permanently
disposing of able-bodied mendicants and impostors, by the authorities, to
arrest and turn them over to some land proprietor as coloni,and thus, from
being a burden, they became a benefit to the community.
The method of leasing to coloniwas similar to that employed at the present day.
Rent could be made payable in cash, or by giving a share of the crop; and when
discharged by the delivery of farm products, the tenant was styled colonus
partiarius.The nature of the compensation was, however, entirely regulated by
the agreement made between the contracting parties.
It was an ancient rule of law that where a man who was actually free cultivated
land as a serf for the term of thirty years, the title to it became vested in
him without any qualification whatever. Such tenants were known as coloni
liberi.The privilege of thus obtaining liberty and property simultaneously by
usucaption was rescinded by Justinian. The condition of colonus,originally an
incident of conquest, and universally imposed upon the provinces of the Empire,
survived for many centuries in Eastern Europe, and "has only within a
comparatively recent
period been abolished.
The Saxon ceorl(or churl) was the prototype of the villain of the English .law.
The social position upon which his integrity (or lack of it) was presumed to
depend was so lightly considered that the oath of a thegn,or lord, was
judicially declared to be equal to that of six villeins,or ceorls. "Thaini
jusjurandum contravalet jusjurandum sex villanorum."(Ancient Laws and
Institutes of England; Leges Regis Henrici PrimiLXIV, 2.) The wer-gild,or fixed
sum which a homicide was compelled to pay to the family of his victim, in
Northumberland, was, in the case of an ealdormanthat is a general, noble, or
royal councillor thirty times greater than that which could be demanded by the
relatives of a ceorl. The status of the latter, who, like the Roman colonus
liber us,was nominally free, was, nevertheless, a most onerous and degraded
one.
The churl is thus defined by an old English legal writer:
"Ceorle (that is of the Carle or Churle) and Husbandman. The Ancients
called him in Latin Villanus,not as we ordinarily take it for a Bondman, but
, for him that dwelling in a Village or Country Town, lived by the Country
course
of Husbandry.
"Such were the Ceorls among the Saxons; but of two sorts, one that hired the
Lord's Out Land or Tenementary Land (called also the Polcland) like our
Farmers; the other that tilled and manured his Inland or Demeans (yielding
Operamnot Censum,Work and not Rent), and were thereupon called his Socmen or
Ploughmen. These, no doubt, were oftentimes his very Bondmen.
"The first sort, who having ordinarily no Lands of their own, lived upon the
Outlands before mentioned of their Lord the Thane, as customary Tenants at his
Will (after the usual manner of that time), rendring into him a certain portion
of Victuals, and things necessary for Hospitality. This Rent or Retribution
they called Feorme, but the word in the Saxon signifieth Meat or Victuals; and
tho' we have ever since Henry IPs time chang'd this reservation of Victuals
into Mony, yet in letting our Lands, we still retain the name of Fearms and
Fearmers
unto this day.
"But this Service was no Bondage. For the Ceorl or Husbandman might as well
leave this Land at his Will, as the Lord might put him from it at his Will:
subject, either under the pretext of a donation, a sale, a lease, or any other
contract, shall be void; and all notaries who dare to draw up such instruments
shall be punished by the confiscation of their property ; provided they acted
knowingly, and the estates or lands of those who have appealed to the
protection of the said powerful person shall be confiscated.
Moreover, all those who, contrary to the public welfare, have been convicted of
having extended their patronage to persons intending to defraud the Treasury,
if they are of noble rank, shall be condemned to pay a fine of a hundred pounds
of gold; and if they are of moderate fortune, shall be punished by the loss of
all their property; and those also who, by their wicked arts, have dishonorably
encouraged these nefarious acts, shall suffer the same penalty.
We order that this law shall be valid and enforced from the time fixed by the
constitution promulgated by the Emperor Martian, of Divine Memory; that is to
say, in the province of Thrace, for thirty years from the Consulate of ^tius,
Consul for the second time, and Sigisbuldus; and in the East and the Provinces
of Egypt, Pontus, and Asia, for twenty-six years, that is to say from the
Consulate of Cyrus.
and therefore it was provided by the Laws of Ina in what manner he should leave
the Land when he departed from it to another Place. And the Writ of Waste in
Pitz-Herbert seemeth to shew that they might depart if they were not then well
used.
"It is apparent also that the Ceorl was of free Condition, for that his Person
was valued as a Member of the Common-Wealth in the Laws of ^thelstan and his
least valuation is there reckoned to be 200, whereas the Bondman was not valued
at all, for that he was not (as I said) any part of the Commonwealth, but of
his Master's Substance; nor was he capable of any Public Office. But the Ceorl
(tho7 he had no Land) might rise to be the Leader of his Country-men, and to
use the Armour of a Thane or Knight, viz. an Helmet, and Habergeon, and a gilt
Sword. And if his Wealth so increased as that he became owner of five Hides of
Land, the valuation of his Person (which they call'd his Were or Weregild) was
increased to two thousand thrimsas,that is six thousand shillings, and being
then also adorned with other marks of Dignity, he was counted for a Thane."
(Spelman, English Works II, Pages 14, 15.)
Early English authorities practically place villeins in the category of slaves,
their condition being due to their birth. "Sunt autem nativi a prima nativitate
sua, quemadmodmn si quis fuerit procreatus ex nativo & nativa, ille quidem
nati-vus nascitur. Idem est si ex patre libera & matre nativa."(Glanvil,
Tractatus De Legibus et Consuetudinibus AnglissV, 6.) When a freeman married a
woman born in villeinage, he "lost his law," and himself became a villein. The
issue of two villeins of different sexes, belonging to different lords, was
divided equally between the latter.
Coke describes villeinage as follows: "Villenagiumis the service of a bondman.
And yet a freeman may doe the service of him that is bond." (Institutes I, II,
116a.) Those subject to this tenure were of two kinds, villeins in gross, who
were attached to the person of their lord, and could be sold or donated by him;
and villeins regardant, who were attached to the soil. The condition of the
villein was one of abject submission to his lord. He was substantially a mere
chattel, like the horse and ox with which he toiled. He could hold no property
of any description, not even conditionally or precariously, in which he was
inferior in privileges to the Roman slave. The degrading menial services to
which he was liable were defined only by the caprice of his lord. The latter
could inflict severe corporeal punishment upon him, but had no right to maim,
or kill him. Unlike
2. The Emperor Justinian.
We decree that when the tributary of anyone marries a woman who is the
tributary of another, or, on the other hand, when some one's female slave
marries the slave of another, the children of the tributary, as well as those
of the slave, will follow the fortune of their mothers, and will belong to the
owners of the latter.
TITLE LIV.
PEASANTS SHALL NOT BE SUBJECTED TO ANY NEW OBLIGATIONS.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars.
No peasant, residing outside the walls of a town, who pays his poll-tax or
contributes his amount of grain, shall be subjected to any other obligations by
the Receiver of Our Treasury, nor shall he be compelled to furnish mules or
horses for the public service.
the colonus,the villein could be voluntarily manumitted by whoever was entitled
to his services. Freedom thus obtained was, as with the colonusunder other
circumstances, qualified, and only applicable to cases in which the interests
of the lord and his successors were involved. Hence, if a villein, who had been
liberated, appeared in court against a stranger, he could not, even if he had
been knighted, proceed, if his birth in villeinage was established by his
adversary. When a lord sued his villein or seduced his wife, either of these
acts, ipso facto,immediately caused his emancipation. Residence for a year and
a day in a town enjoying franchise either by prescription or charter, enabling
him to be admitted into the community as a citizen, also released him from the
obligations of villeinage. (VideGlanvil, Ibid.,V, 5.)
According to the old English law, there were two methods by which a person
could be subjected to the obligations of villeinage.
"Also, every villein is either a villeine by title of prescription, to wit,
that See and his ancestors have been villeines time out of mind of man; or he
is a villeine by his owne confession in a court of record.
"But if a freeman hath divers issues, and afterwards he confesseth himselfe to
be a villaine to another in a court of record; yet those issues which he hath
before the confession are free, but the issues which he shall have after the
confession shall be villaines." (Littleton, Tenures II, II, Secs. 175, 176.)
This confession is interpreted by Coke to mean that a freeman could not, as
under the Civil Law, voluntarily adopt the status and incident disabilities of
a serf; and that it merely meant that he publicly acknowledged that he was born
in that condition, and therefore had hitherto, occupied a position in society
to which he was not entitled. (Coke, Institutes III, II, 117b.) If this be the
case, it seems extraordinary that his children, born while he was in reality a
serf, should become free; while their father, whose status always legally
remained the same, despite the pretended character which he had wrongfully
assumed, was reduced to bondage.
The requirements of serfdom, during the Middle Ages, were far more exacting and
oppressive in France than in England. The tyranny of the nobles was exercised,
almost without restraint, upon the unhappy dependent, whose birth rendered him
a slave in all but name. The odious privilege known as the Jus primse noctis,or
"Droit de prelibation,"attaching to many fiefs, including those held by the
clergy, by which the bride of a serf was at the discretion of her lord
immediately after the marriage ceremony, and which was unknown in England, was
one of the most reprehensible but popular of the seigniorial rights enjoyed by
the privileged classes of the kingdom, which were swept away by the
Revolution.ED.
2. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Probus, Prsetorian Prefect of
Ittyria.
Any of those belonging to the retinue of Governors of provinces, who hold the
first rank in different offices, and, under the pretext of public duty, have
the power to commit extortion and impose upon any peasant who is required to
render them services, just as if he was their own slave, or deprive him of his
slaves or his cattle, for the purpose of converting them to their own use,
shall, having been deprived of all their property, be sentenced to perpetual
exile, and any peasant who voluntarily assists in the perpetration of such acts
shall be punished with equal severity.
Given at Agrippina, on the day before the Kalendsof October, during the
Consulate of Valentinian and Valens, 365.
TITLE LV.
THE RESIDENTS OF A MOTHER-VILLAGE ARE NOT PERMITTED TO TRANSFER THEIR LANDS TO
STRANGERS.
1. The Emperors Leo and Anthemius to Nicostratus, Praetorian Prefect.
Through motives of humanity, We deem it necessary for the following provision
to be added to those previously enacted with reference to what are called
"mother-villages," to prevent the owner of land from transferring the same to a
stranger, under any circumstances. Hence, if anyone should desire to alienate
land which belongs to him, he shall not be permitted, under the terms of any
contract whatsoever, to convey the ownership and possession of said land to
anyone except a registered inhabitant of the same village, and all strangers
are hereby notified that if they attempt to conclude, or obtain possession of
property by means of a transaction of this kind, in violation of what is
forbidden by law, every such agreement entered into will be of no force or
effect, and if it has been completed, and the property delivered, the latter
shall merely be returned.
TITLE LVI.
No RESIDENT OF A VILLAGE SHALL BE LIABLE FOR THE DEBTS OF OTHER RESIDENTS OF
THE SAME VILLAGE.
1. The Emperor Zeno.
It is not only a serious offence in law, but it is also contrary to the
principles of natural equity that persons should be molested on account of the
debts of others, and therefore, We forbid injustice of this kind to be
perpetrated against the inhabitants of villages under any circumstances.
TITLE LVII.
CONCERNING TAXES, TAX GATHERERS, APPRAISERS, AND INSPECTORS.
1. The Emperor Constantine to the People.
As the receivers of taxes in cities, acting in collusion with powerful persons,
are in the habit of transferring the greater part of the burden of taxation to
persons of inferior rank, everyone who is able to prove that he has been
imposed upon in this way shall only be required to pay the amount originally
allotted to him.
Given at Rome, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate
of Constantine, Consul for the third time, and Licinius, 313.
2. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Eutro-pius, Prsetorian
Prefect.
Anyone who cuts down his vines, or removes the buds from his fruit trees, for
the purpose of avoiding the payment of taxes, and fraudulently represents
himself to be poor, shall be subject to the penalty of the law as soon as he is
detected. But as you are found to have done this without fraudulent intent, and
not for the purpose of causing sterility or the failure of the fruit crop, but
in order to increase production, you will incur no criminal responsibility.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Nonesof June, during the
Consulate of Eucherius and Syagrius, 381.
3. The Same Emperors to Cynegius, Prsetorian Prefect.
If anyone should make complaint of having been imposed upon, and an appraiser
should be despatched for the purpose of investigation, and the tributary should
then remove his agent, or eject his tenant, under the pretext of his obstinacy,
he shall, by Our authority, be compelled to pay the amount of the tax fixed by
the appraiser, during his own absence, or that of his agent.
Given at Constantinople, on the sixth of the Kalendsof April, during the
Consulate of Our Prince Honorius and Evodius, 386.
4. The Emperors Theodosius, Arcadius, and Honorius to Rufinus, Prsetorian
Prefect.
All land shall be inscribed upon the rolls of the Census, and whenever relief
is demanded, the amount of tax assessed upon sterile and barren soil shall be
made up by a levy upon that which is cultivated and productive.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Nonesof April, during the
Consulate of Theodosius, Consul for the third time, and Abundan-tius, 393.
5. The Same Emperors to Rufinus, Prsetorian Prefect.Those who complain of
having been imposed upon by appraisers, and allege that they have been
subjected to unjust burdens, have the
right to accuse them, if any indulgence was granted to others, or any property
was fraudulently misappropriated, and shall be entitled to relief, where they
can prove that they have been treated with injustice, or that a criminal
transaction has taken place, for the purpose of favoring others.
This, however, should be done within a year after the record was made, by which
it appears that an inequitable burden was imposed, and, during the same time an
accusation must be brought against the appraiser, and the fact that he has
favored another in consideration of having been paid must be established, so
that he may be held responsible for the amount of the excess which he
fraudulently misappropriated from the contribution due to the State.
This action shall not be barred by lapse of time, except in the case of minors
who are undefended. Those who were absent on public business, but who acted
within the time prescribed by law, shall, for this reason, have power to apply
to the courts for relief.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Kalendsof December, during the
Consulate of Our Lord the Emperor Theodosius, Consul for the third time, and
Abundantius, 393.
6. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Eusebius, Praetorian Prefect.
When appraisers and examiners are found guilty of negligence, or of illegally
favoring anyone, they shall not only be subjected to the loss of their
property, but shall also be forced to pay a fine equal to four times the amount
of their salaries. Those who are convicted of having accepted anything to the
prejudice of the people of the provinces shall be compelled to pay fourfold
damages.
Gfoen at Milan, on the fourth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of
Arcadius and Honorius, Consuls for the third time, 396.
7. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Sebastian, Count of the First Rank.
Where abandoned land has been transferred by an appraiser to anyone, the latter
shall retain possession of the same without being disturbed. Moreover, We do
not permit the Treasury to molest the new owner, on account of any previous
contributions which remain unpaid, as one should not be responsible for the
fault of another. If, however, any private individual should allege that land
abandoned up to the present time is encumbered in his favor, or that he is
entitled to it for some other reason, he must prove his allegations v/ithout
delay, either in person, or through someone else authorized by law to do so, in
order that, if his claim is an equitable one, the property may be transferred
to him, and he who received it from the appraiser shall be reimbursed for the
expenses incurred in the improvement of the property.
But, to prevent donations, once made, from being interfered with by means of
litigation, We decree that the term of six months shall be established, within
which time he who thinks that he has a good
title to the property must institute the proper proceedings to recover iitt..When,
however, the term above designated is permitted to expire, We are unwilling for
any attempt to be made for its recovery. If anyone should, either in his own
proper person, or by his representatives, neglect to take this step, when the
appraiser adjudges him the land, and the six months should elapse, he shall not
be able to do so at any
time thereafter.
\Given at Ravenna, on the day before the Idesof March, during the Consulate of
Honorius, Consul for the eleventh time, and Constantius, Consul for the second
time, 417.
TITLE LVIII.
CONCERNING ABANDONED LANDS AND WHEN SUCH AS
ARE BARREN ARE CONSIDERED TO BE ATTACHED TO THOSE
THAT ARE FERTILE.
1. The Emperor Constantine.
As Our relative, the Divine Aurelian, ordered the decurionates of cities to be
responsible for the taxes due on abandoned lands, as well as on those whose
owners cannot be found, so We decree that, after the first three years of
possession, they shall be exempt from all enforced contributions.
We decree that this law shall be observed, and if it should be established that
the said decurionates are not able to pay the taxes assessed on said lands, the
latter shall be divided among the citizens.
2. The Same Emperor.
When anyone buys land from a tenant holding under emphyteusis, or having a
private right to the same through inheritance, upon which other real property
is dependent, and the strength of the latter having become undermined, it falls
into decay, any burdens attaching to the ownership of the said land which was
useless while in the hands of the person who abandoned it must be borne by the
purchaser.
Given at Thessalonica, on the eighth of the Idesof December, during the
Consulate of Felicianus and Titian, 337.
3. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens.
Anyone who obtains deserted land under a grant of immunity from taxation for a
certain time shall not be placed in possession of the same before sureties, who
are solvent, have been furnished at the risk of the decurions, or he has
hypothecated lands of his own which should be of good quality, and thereby have
given sufficient security that the land acquired by him will not be abandoned
with any detriment to the public welfare.
4. The Same Emperors and Gratian to Crescentius.Testamentary heirs are also
obliged to sustain fiscal burdens imposed upon unproductive land belonging to
the estate, or if they think
that they should reject the estate, they must restore to it everything which
they have received therefrom, by any right or title whatsoever. Given on the
fourth of the Ides ofJuly, during the Consulate of Gratian, Consul for the
second time, and Probus, 337.
5. The Emperors Valentinian and Theodosius.
Persons who have acquired productive lands from the State shall also receive
other lands which have been abandoned, and if they should consider themselves
aggrieved by the addition of lands which they formerly abandoned through
disgust, they must transfer them to other decurions, who will hold them under
the condition of paying the taxes assessed upon both, for it would be unjust
for the choice land to be retained by a few persons, and the decurionate to be
oppressed with the burden imposed by the remainder.
6. The Same Emperors.
Where a lessee is in possession of a fertile tract of land, which has been
acquired from the public domain, or from some temple, an unproductive tract
shall be united with it. When, however, the lessor refuses to accept it,
another possessor must be sought for on the same terms, and if a voluntary
lessor cannot be found, then the land shall revert to the ancient possessors,
that is to say, the decurions, or any others whomsoever, with the addition of
the barren land as above mentioned, after solvent sureties have been furnished.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof February, during the
Consulate of Merobaudus and Saturninus, 383.
7. The Same Emperor.
Anyone who cultivates an abandoned tract of land belonging to Our private
domain, and renders it fertile and valuable shall, in accordance with the rule
established in such cases, become the private owner of the same forever, and
shall hold it as his own property, just as if he had acquired it by inheritance
from his ancestors, and shall have the right to bequeath it to his descendants;
nor can anyone, by the production of a rescript, or of any other Imperial
written instrument, exclude him from the enjoyment of the fruits of the labor
which he has performed.
Moreover, We order that those who are in possession of rich and fertile lands,
or even think that they are now entitled to any such, shall be liable for all
taxes due at the time on lands which have been abandoned. Those, likewise, who
hold lands which are neither fertile nor altogether sterile, under the tenure
of emphyteusis, as in the case of those who are also in need of relief, must
remember that after the term of two years has expired they shall, in conformity
with the ordinary rule, be liable for the regular taxes which may be due.
No one, no matter what his rank or power may be, shall be released from the
obligation of receiving as his own lands which have been abandoned, and which
formed part of Our patrimony, and he must pay the tributes and tax imposed upon
them.
It should also be specially observed that the adjoining owners will primarily
be liable for this payment, and if the said lands do not join, and are not in
the same neighborhood, those farther away will be responsible. The appointment
should be made in such a way as to be based upon propinquity, or regulated by
the intervening space, and in such a way as to be in conformity with justice
and moderation, so that what is for the profit of all may be effected by
universal consent.
8. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Tatian, Praetorian
Prefect.
Where anyone desires to cultivate fields abandoned by their owner, -whether
they are situated at a distance, or are adjacent to his own premises, and
whether they belong to private individuals, or are part of the public domain,
he is hereby notified that he has Our authority to do so; provided, however,
that if the new cultivator establishes himself on the vacant or abandoned land,
and the former owner wishes to assert his right to the same within the term of
two years, he shall have the right to do so, after having, in the first place,
reimbursed the recent occupant for any expenses which he may have incurred. If,
however, the said term of two years has expired, he who remained silent during
the time shall have no right to either the possession, or ownership.
9. The Same Emperors and Uonorius.
All those, without exception, who hold under a lease lands belonging to Our
private domain, are hereby informed that they are required to accept lands of
inferior fertility along with those which are productive, and they must not
refuse to hold them, or, if they reject fields which are sterile, they must
surrender those which are fertile.
10. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Eutychianus, Pr&-torian Prefect.
Persons who have received rich and fruitful lands from the State shall be
compelled to accept, along with them, a proportionate amount of sterile and
unproductive soil.
Given at Constantinople, on the Nonesof March, during the Consulate of
Honorius, Consul for the fourth time, and Eutychianus, 398.
11. The Same Emperors to Hadrian.
The owners of abandoned lands shall be summoned by public proclamation to
return, resume possession of the same within the term of six months, and pay
any taxes which may be due. If, however, they show by their absence that the
land did not produce crops sufficient to pay the tribute, and they refuse to
return, the land shall be transferred to those who are willing to accept it,
and who promise that they will certainly pay the tribute in arrears. They shall
then obtain undisputed ownership of the said land, and are notified that, if
afterwards they discharge the indebtedness they will be subjected to no
annoyance, and will not, through the intrigues of anyone whomsoever, be
deprived of the land which they occupy. We also enjoin upon them
the payment of tribute from the time when they first acquired possession of the
land in question.
12. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Seleucus, Prsetorian Prefect.
We order, by this law, that no possessor of land which is profitable shall be
rendered liable for debts due from other persons whose land is unproductive,
and that fertile lands shall not be considered as united with others which are
sterile, unless it is shown that they belong to the same person; and this rule
is established to prevent any extortion from being committed under any pretext
or fiction.
Given at Ravenna, on the day before the Kalendsof February, during the
Consulate of Honorius, Consul for the eighth time, and Theodosius, Consul for
the fifth time, 412.
13. The Same Emperors.
The managers and the owners of land are warned that if, through their fault,
the tribute due on account of said land is not paid, it will be absolutely
necessary for the ownership of the same to be transferred.
14. The Same Emperors.
Lands which decurionates have, under some contract, which has been duly
registered with the Governor of the province, either abandoned or conveyed to
others, shall remain permanently in the possession of those who cultivated
them, and pay the tribute due to the Treasury, and the decurionates shall not
have the power to reclaim them.
15. The Same Emperors to Sebastianus.
Where anyone has legally received, from the proper authority, any deserted
lands, taxes upon which were levied for the benefit of the navy, and which have
remained abandoned up to this time, it is proper that they should be improved
in every respect, and that the naval assessment should not be imposed upon them
except when other financial burdens have been suspended.
16. The Same Emperors to Hermogenes.
When anyone, by the authority of the Emperor, receives unproductive lands
forming part of the Imperial domain, under the agreement to pay a certain tax,
We desire him to retain undisputed possession of the same in consideration of
his paying annually the amount which the Emperor has declared must be paid; and
We decree that the said land shall hereafter not be subjected to any new tax,
additional burden, or imposition whatsoever, as it would be absurd for persons,
at Our request, to improve unproductive lands which demand the exertion of
great labor, or the expenditure of entire fortunes to complete said
improvements, so that being deceived, and compelled to assume an unexpected
burden, they may allege that they have been, as it were, defrauded; and that if
they had known that the lands had been
transferred to them under such conditions, they would have refused to accept
them, or even to engage in their cultivation.
17. The Emperor Valentinian.
We order that no decurion shall be responsible for any taxes due from the lands
of others, but shall only be obliged to pay what is assessed upon his own
property.
Given at Ravenna, on the fifth of the Kalendsof May, after the Consulate of
Felix and Taurus, 429.
TITLE LIX.
CONCERNING LANDS AND THEIR BOUNDARIES, MARSHES, PASTURES, FRONTIER MILITARY
STATIONS, AND THE GARRISONS OF FORTRESSES.
1. The Emperors Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian to Licinius, Prsetorian
Prefect.
Tiberianus designated certain lands whose owners were charged with the
transportation of grain to the frontiers after having carefully weighed the
ability of the latter to discharge this duty, hence We, by this general law, do
order that the regulations of Tiberianus shall be observed, hereby annulling
every exemption which may have been obtained through the influence of anyone,
or by means of some petition furtively presented for that purpose; and, in
addition, We decree that, for the future, no one shall be permitted to evade
this ancient custom, ,or refuse obedience to the present law, or request that
it may not be enforced.
2. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius.
The possessor of lands attached to fortresses must surrender and abandon them,
for the reason that only those to whom they have been assigned are entitled to
hold lands attached to fortresses, unless some ancient custom is applicable to
them.
If any private individual, who is not a soldier of the garrison of a fortress,
should hereafter be found in possession of such lands, he shall be punished
with death and the confiscation of his property.
3. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian.
Where soldiers have been accustomed to take care of, and plow lands on the
frontiers, together with the marshes in the neighborhood, for their own
benefit, under some ancient law, free from all public burdens, and when the
said lands are, at present, in cultivation, they shall be held by said soldiers
without question as to their title, and free from the imposition of any tax;
and if such lands are in the possession of Others, they can not be acquired by
the latter through lapse of time, and can be recovered from all those who hold
them; and We desire them to be transferred to the said soldiers without being
liable to any enforced contribution, as was prescribed by an ancient law.
The penalty of confiscation shall be inflicted upon those who violate the
present rule, for when anyone by purchase holds possession of property like
that above mentioned (which he should, by no means, venture to do), he will
unquestionably have a right of action against the vendor.
TITLE LX. CONCERNING PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PASTURES.
1. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius.
As there is no reason why the rent of pastures belonging to Our private domain
should be increased, this must not be done according to the pleasure of
decurions, for We have learned that higher rent has been collected by them, and
that they have also excluded animals belonging to Our private domain from said
pastures. The Emperor Julian, of Divine Memory, forbade this by a decree which
he promulgated, and therefore, Your Excellency having summoned the Governors of
provinces, will inform them that this liberty which the municipalities have
assumed cannot be tolerated, but that the same custom which was established in
ancient times shall continue to prevail.
2. The Emperors Arcadia and Honorius.
Your Excellency must see that animals belonging to soldiers are excluded from
all public fields and pleasure grounds, and forbid them to be pastured there,
and all persons, including your subordinate officials, are notified that if
anyone should, hereafter, make use of the above-mentioned fields for this
purpose, he shall be compelled to pay twelve pounds of gold to the Treasury,
and the same penalty shall be imposed if the fields belonging either to private
individuals, or to the citizens of Antioch, are trespassed upon in this manner.
Decurions must, however, provide for the maintenance of animals belonging to
the soldiers, without causing any injury to the inhabitants of the provinces.
3. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to All Counts and Generals.
Lands belonging to the inhabitants of Our provinces, as well as those of Our
private domain, must not be injured or interfered with by soldiers, and
therefore, by the present law, which has been promulgated to the Prefecture for
execution, We decree that this abuse shall not occur hereafter. Your Highness
will not delay to see that all necessary measures are taken, in this instance,
for the enforcement of the laws, and you must not permit the owners or tenants
of land to be annoyed by any acts of soldiers whatsoever.
Given on the Nonesof September, during the Consulate of Honorius, Consul for
the tenth time, and Theodosius, Consul for the sixth time, 415.
TITLE LXI.
CONCERNING LANDS AND FORESTS BELONGING TO THE EMPEROR, AND EMPHYTEUTICAL
CONTRACTS AND LESSEES UNDER THE SAME.
1. The Emperor Constantine to Cypitus.
If anyone should, without judicial authority, alienate lands held under
emphyteusis, the alienation shall stand, provided the person who received them
is compelled to pay the rent due to the Treasury at the specified times.
Published on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of
Constantine, Consul for the fourth time, and Licinius, Consul for the third
time, 315.
2. The Same Emperor to Dracontius.
We order that the failure to pay rent due for land belonging to the domain of
the Emperor, within the time prescribed, whether the payment is to be in money
or grain, shall not prejudice the ownership of minors, nor shall they sustain
any injury if what is due should be paid a little later, provided the judge
compels the guardian or curator, through whose negligence payment was deferred,
to make good the loss sustained, and also subjects him to the penalties
incurred for the non-performance of his duty.
3. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Germanianus, Count of the Imperial
Largesses.
Those persons who have received lands by the right of emphyteusis cannot refuse
to pay the rent, under the pretext that the land was sterile, even if they have
fraudulently obtained a rescript for that purpose. Nor shall they be deprived
of the said lands, even if a higher rent has been promised by another, but they
shall remain forever in the hands of those who have received them, and of their
posterity, although a rescript to the contrary may have been obtained against
them.
4. The Emperors Valens, Gratian, and Valentinian.
Persons who have obtained lands forming part of Our private domain, which have
come into Our possession in different ways and are now held under emphyteusis,
shall have no fear of their being confiscated, for We convey the entire
ownership of said lands, rather than merely lease them, provided the lessees
afterwards, at the proper times, pay the rent which has been agreed upon.
5. The Emperors Gratian and Valentinian.
When any person receives land belonging to Our domain, which has been abandoned
by former tenants, or those who held under emphyteusis, from the proper
authority, he shall retain said land forever,
by an undisputable right, nor shall the demands of any second claimant be
heard.
6. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius.
Persons to whom lands belonging to the Imperial domain situated in the
provinces of Asia or Pontus, and which has been donated to them by Us, or by
Our Divine Ancestors, shall hold possession of the same without molestation,
and transmit them to their heirs.
So far as the transmission of the property is concerned We desire that this
rule shall apply not only to descent to their heirs, but also to every kind of
contract which the donees may enter into.
7. The Same Emperors to Cynegius.
Those who obtain lands forming part of the Imperial domain, or which belong to
the State under emphyteusis by Our order, if they are sufficiently solvent to
pay the rent, must pledge their own property by way of security for such
payment, to provide against the said lands being abandoned. When, however, they
are not solvent, they can acquire the land by emphyteutical right, after having
furnished proper sureties, and the officials whose duty it is to have charge of
such matters are notified that if any loss results from their negligence, and
the security given should not prove to be good, they themselves will be
responsible.
8. The Same Emperors to Nedearchus.
All the lands belonging to Our private domain, situated in the Mesopotamian and
Osdroenian provinces, and which were set apart by the orders of Our Imperial
predecessors for the use of soldiers on the frontier, shall all be restored to
their former condition, notwithstanding any objection which may be urged
against this as everything which was formerly destined for the necessities of
the frontier should be preserved, and no one shall be heard who advances any
claim based either upon a rescript, an Imperial annotation, an emphyteutical
contract, or a lease of any description, which has been obtained through Our
liberality.
9. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius.
All persons are hereby notified that with the exception of the tax, nothing in
common exists between land privately purchased by the Emperor and that already
belonging to the Imperial domain, so that appraisers must never confuse the
two, and those who venture to violate the present law shall be severely
punished.
10. The Same Emperors to Eutychianus, Praetorian Prefect.
Your Highness will order that only those lands belonging to Our private domain,
which have been granted to anyone through Our liberality with the reservation
of a specified tax, shall be considered in the same class with those also
forming part of Our private domain,
which have been rented conditionally, so that any tenants who are oppressed by
the burdens imposed upon them may be relieved, and their liabilities
transferred to others who are more prosperous, and the apportionment of tribute
thus be equally divided.
11. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius.
We order that the right of emphyteusis, by which land is held without being
subject to any other requirement, shall remain forever unimpaired, but We are
unwilling that mere possession should obtain the benefit of prescription, which
possession has been invalidated without the existence of any special
obligation.
12. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Taurus, Praetorian Prefect.
Possessors holding land of the Imperial domain by the right of emphyteusis, and
who, up to this time, have not purchased the property, cannot be compelled to
do so, but they shall be considered as having paid the price of the same; and
hence they obtain the benefit of Our generosity, so that the emphyteutas
aforesaid will obtain through Our liberality what another could secure by
paying the purchase-money. They are advised that the title to the land which
they cultivate, and of which they have obtained possession either by
inheritance, private purchase, Imperial generosity, or in any other way
whatsoever, will remain unimpaired and inviolate, and that permission will be
granted all holding under emphyteusis to emancipate slaves attached to said
land of the Imperial domain as they are the owners of said land.
13. The Same Emperors to Florentius.
We order that, hereafter, no one shall be allowed to transfer to private
individuals any portion of the Imperial domain, or any lands situated on the
frontier, or any forests throughout the East, whether said lands are subject to
taxation or exempt.
Persons who violate this law shall be liable to a penalty of fifty pounds of
gold, which, shall be incurred by a petitioner, as well as by the officer who
grants the request, even though an Imperial annotation or a pragmatic sanction
may be produced by way of justification.
14. The Emperor Anastasius.
We order that all those who, in any diocese, province, forest, or city
whatsoever, have now, or may hereafter obtain possession of lands belonging to
the Imperial domain, or to temples, or to a director of the public games, or to
any other government official whomsoever, without any title, up to this time,
for forty years without interruption (this possession being computed not only
with reference to those who now hold the land, but also with reference to
others who formerly held it), or who may hereafter possess real property of
this kind for the aforesaid term of forty years, need entertain no fear of a
public action, or
of molestation or annoyance of any description whatsoever, concerning the
ownership of the land or buildings above mentioned. But if they pay the annual
tax imposed, which is dependent upon the nature of the right under which the
said lands or premises are held by him to whom they were granted, they shall be
considered as absolutely belonging to those who are now in possession, or may
afterwards obtain possession of the same.
Hence all persons shall be excluded from raising the question as to their
ownership, under any pretext whatsoever, and an exception based upon any title,
or even without any title to actual possession, for the term of forty years,
will suffice; and it must be added that those also who can prove that lands of
this kind were originally given to them by order of the Emperor, exempt from
any liability, and that they have lawfully been in possession of them for forty
consecutive years without the payment of rent, no tax which (as above stated)
has not been imposed during the possession of forty years can afterwards be
levied, for the reason that We have established the rule that, in both cases,
that is to say, where the tax is either reserved or released, the rights of the
parties in possession shall, without any change whatever, remain in the same
condition in which they continued during the term of forty years, as aforesaid.
TITLE LXII.
CONCERNING SLAVES AND SERFS ATTACHED TO THE
PRIVATE DOMAIN OF THE EMPEROR, PASTURES, AND
LANDS HELD UNDER EMPHYTEUSIS.
1. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens.
Serfs commit a wrong against emphyteutas by taking possession of lands of
greater extent than they are accustomed to cultivate, as they are not legally
entitled to handle any which have not been planted with olive orchards, or
vines by their own labor. They also attempt to illegally make use of the water
of springs, the benefit of which emphyteutas, alone, are permitted to enjoy. It
has therefore been decided that, hereafter, the right to and enjoyment of water
shall only be permitted to emphyteutas, and that serfs shall obtain from them
no more than is manifestly required for the irrigation of the fields which they
themselves cultivate, and that they must make arrangements with the emphyteutas
in possession to pay rent for any superfluous water which they may need for the
purpose of tillage.
2. The Emperors Valens, Gratian, and Valentinian.
Receivers of the Treasury shall, by the authority of this law, rescind all
grants of freedom which may have been bestowed upon slaves attached to Our
Imperial domain, or to lands held under emphy-teusis, by persons who are not
the owners of the same.
3. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius, to Post-humianus,
Prsstorian Prefect.
We have ascertained that serfs who, from ancient times, have been attached to
Our private domain, have been removed by persons to whom the same has been
granted by Us, and that their own slaves, or other serfs, have been placed
there in their stead. Therefore, by the authority of this Edict, We direct that
those who, hereafter, attempt anything of this kind, shall be deprived of the
said land.
4. The Same Emperors to Cynegius, Prsetorian Prefect.
It was recently established by Our laws, enacted with reference to maintaining
Our domain in good condition, that the serfs who formerly cultivated the land,
and have in some instances settled elsewhere, and others who have enlisted in
the army, could be reduced to the status of their ancestors, and recalled to
the discharge of their specific duties.
We do not, however, by any means intend that those who, having performed
military service, deserve to be left in leisure and peace, and are entitled to
the privilege of veterans, should exchange their weapons for plows and hoes.
TITLE LXIII.
CONCERNING FUGITIVE SERFS ATTACHED TO THE IMPERIAL ESTATES, AND TO FORESTS AND
LANDS HELD UNDER EMPHYTEUSIS.
1. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadiws.
Whenever any sons of decurions, or serfs attached to the Imperial domain, or to
any of the forests belonging to the same, with reference to which their
ancestors or parents were required to perform public duties, have with the
connivance of military officers, or other persons, enlisted in the army, or
obtained other employment, they shall be recalled to their municipal duties or
to the cultivation of their lands by the commanders and tribunes aforesaid, nor
shall their past military service be of any advantage to them.
2. The Same Emperors to Cynegius, Przetorian Prefect.
Anyone who leads astray or secretly harbors a serf attached to the Imperial
domain shall not only be compelled to restore him, but shall also be subjected
to a fine of a pound of gold by way of penalty.
Published at Constantinople, on the eighth of the Kalendsof November, during
the Consulate of Our Prince Honorius, and Evodius, 886.
3. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius.
All persons attached to lands belonging to the Imperial domain, who have been
removed therefrom by the authority of an Imperial annotation or rescript which
has been or may hereafter be obtained,
and who are serving in any rank in the army, shall immediately be sent back
under a suitable guard appointed by the Governor of the province.
TITLE LXIV.
CONCERNING OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED UPON THE OCCUPANTS
OF LANDS BELONGING TO THE IMPERIAL DOMAIN AND
OTHERS HELD UNDER EMPHYTEUSIS.
1. The Emperor Constantine to Proculiis, Proconsul of Africa.
Possessors holding under emphyteusis, although they may have been released from
extraordinary impositions through Our indulgence are, nevertheless, like other
inhabitants of the provinces, liable to the payment of taxes for the repair of
the roads, for there is no reason why they should be exempt from what is for
the common benefit of all.
Published at Carthage, on the Nonesof May, during the Fifth Consulate of
Constantine, and the Caesar Licinius, 319.
2. The Same Emperor to Catulinus.
It is not proper for lands constituting part of the Imperial domain to be
subjected to extraordinary burdens, or be compelled to give half or a third of
the crop, as it is well known that they, for the most part, already pay a
rental either in money or in grain.
Anyone who attempts to violate this law shall be punished.
Published at Carthage, on the sixth of the Kalendsof September, during the
Fifth Consulate of Constantine and Licinius.
3. The Emperor Julian.
All persons who are in possession of land belonging to the Imperial domain,
whether they hold them in common or in their entirety, shall be required to pay
their shares of all taxes charged against said land, either in proportion to
their ownership or to the full amount, just as the necessities of the public
welfare impose the obligation of payment upon all private individuals.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Mamertinus
and Nevitta, 362.
4. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens.
It has been decided that the possessors of land held under emphyteusis, as well
as of that belonging to the Imperial domain, shall be permitted to give to the
Receiver of the Treasury, at any time that they wish, as much of the rent as
they may have (provided that it is not paid in more than three installments
during each year), and that they shall be entitled to receipts for said
payments, upon the same day, as is customary, provided that the entire sum due
is paid to the Public Receivers before the Idesof January.
Any official who refuses to accept these payments on account, at any time of
the year (provided they do not exceed three in number),
or is guilty of delay in giving a written receipt for the same, shall be
subjected to severe punishment.
The possessors of the land or their agents must, under such circumstances,
apply to a magistrate or someone who represents him, and has power to act, so
that the insolence of the officials may be proved and punished, and the
interests of the parties be protected.
5. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius.
The tax imposed upon occupants of the Imperial domain, in all the provinces,
shall be collected by the ordinary judges, and whatever is obtained shall be
deposited in the Treasury.
Moreover, the above-mentioned judges are notified that none of the private
property of the Emperor, nor any of the tax derived from the same, shall be
devoted to other purposes, unless they desire their audacity to be punished
with exemplary severity.
TITLE LXV.
CONCERNING THE LANDS BELONGING TO THE PRIVATE ESTATE OP THE EMPEROR, AND THE
FORESTS ATTACHED TO THE IMPERIAL HOUSEHOLD.
1. The Emperor Constantine.
All persons are notified that any property which they have purchased or may
purchase from Our Treasury can, under no circumstances, again be claimed by Us,
that all such possessions are irrevocable, and that the ownership of the same
may be transmitted to their heirs for all time.
2. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens.
Those whose private convenience demands the acquisition of lands belonging to
Our private domain can apply to Your Excellency, set forth their wishes by
means of a petition, and rest assured that every estate will pass to the new
owner, together with the tax or financial burden to which it is at present
liable, so that, no matter what may be expended upon the property by his care
or industry, or whatever increase of slaves or cattle may take place, he will
not be subjected to any additional poll or land tax, but that the benefit of
the same will accrue solely to the owners of the property and their heirs.
Moreover, if anyone should fail to pay the tax due each year, at the designated
time, and he is proved to be in default, he shall be compelled to make payment
without delay. And if he should be found to be insolvent, and not able to pay
the prescribed tax, We order that the property which he received for Our estate
shall be transferred to someone else who is solvent, but that the latter shall
not be oppressed with the payment of the arrears of his predecessor.
3. The Emperors Gratian and Valentinian.
Where anyone, having acquired land belonging to Our private estate in his .own
name, either by the right of emphyteusis or under an ordi-
nary lease, transfers the said land to a person who is insolvent, and unable to
pay the tax or rent to which the land is liable, he who transferred the same
shall be subrogated to his successor, and shall always remain responsible for
the payment of what is due.
4. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius.
All lands belonging to the temples shall be committed to the care and
administration of the Stewards of Our private estate, and they must always
exert themselves with peculiar zeal to the collection of the entire amounts due
from them, as has always been the case.
5. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius.
The use of water destined for the irrigation of Our lands is said to have been
appropriated by many persons, and this having occurred through the connivance
or deceit of Our Stewards, the usually fertile soil, which has been deprived of
it, has failed to yield any crops to the cultivators of the same. Therefore,
for the reason that it is extremely unjust that Our estates, formerly in a
flourishing condition, should now become arid and barren, We order that the
water shall be conducted to its previous destination, irrespective of any
prescription.
6. The Same Emperors.
No one having charge of Our Imperial domain shall molest another who has served
for thirty years as the member of a guild, a decurionate, a barough, or any
other corporate body without his right being challenged, but the latter shall
continue to be a member of the said decurionate or corporate body to which he
is attached.
Given at Milan, on the third of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of
Stilicho and Aurelian, 400.
7. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian.
No one shall purchase any part of the private estate of the Emperor which is
not subject to some rental, and if anyone should, hereafter, enter into a
prohibited contract of this description, We desire that he shall forever lose
the price which he paid, and have no right to present any claim for expenses
incurred, or for any improvements which he has made on the property, nor can he
flatter himself that he will be entitled to any advantage arising from
prescription, except where this is authorized by former laws.
Any officer of the palace who permits such a contract to be entered into, or
who draws up a petition to this effect, must pay a fine of fifty pounds of gold
to Our Treasury. No order which is prejudicial to Our interest shall be valid
in a case of this kind, even though it may be an Imperial annotation or
pragmatic sanction authorizing such a sale, contrary to what has been provided,
nor shall the penalty imposed upon the officer of the palace be remitted.
TITLE LXVI.
CONCERNING THE LANDS AND FORESTS BELONGING TO THE PRIVATE DOMAIN OF THE
EMPEROR.
1. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius.
If anyone should turn his flock of sheep or his drove of horses into the
pastures forming part of the private estate of the Emperor, it shall
immediately be confiscated to the Treasury. If this should take place hereafter
through the corrupt connivance of the Imperial Stewards, We order that they
shall be subjected to the severest punishment.
2. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian.
Where anyone has the audacity to occupy lands belonging to Our private domain,
the said lands shall be restored to their former condition, in accordance with
the ancient registry, and any rescripts fraudulently obtained, or any
prescription based upon long time, or any new record of the census shall, under
such circumstances, be of no avail, for the title to Our property cannot be
annulled by a false report, a lasting possession, or a new registry.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifth of the Kalendsof April, during the
Consulate of Arcadius, Consul for the fourth time, and Honorius, Consul for the
third time, 396.
TITLE LXVII.
CONCERNING THE CULTIVATORS AND SLAVES BELONGING TO THE DOMAIN OP THE EMPEROR,
OR THE IMPERIAL
TREASURY.
1. The Emperor Constantine.
No original serf attached to Our private domain shall be raised to any dignity,
or be called upon to perform any curial duties, as it is not necessary for the
decurions of towns and other citizens from whom any number of appointments of
competent persons can be made, to be degraded by a selection of this kind for
high municipal honors.
2. The Same Emperor to Januarius, Pr&torian Prefect.
We order that Our serfs who have been employed by private individuals for the
purpose of keeping accounts, or for the tillage of _the soil, be reduced to
their former status, and only be used in the cultivation of Our lands.
Moreover, the rule must hereafter be observed that none of them shall undertake
the transaction of anyone's private business, or any other administration
whatsoever.
3. The Same Emperor to Equitius.
Slaves and serfs, their children and grandchildren, and any other persons
attached to Our lands and demesnes, who clandestinely engage
in other occupations, shall be returned to their former status, even if they
have already been enrolled in the army, for We decree that they shall be
discharged and return, even if they have attained to the rank of protectors.
4. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius.
You will cause all children of either sex, born to men of free birth and female
serfs or slaves, to be assigned to the condition to which their mothers belong.
5. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius.
We do not permit serfs attached to Our private estates to be subject to tax, or
compelled to perform extraordinary services, especially when these are said to
be imposed upon them contrary to long-established custom.
6. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian.
Whenever it is decided to sell any portion of Our private domain to a serf, it
must not be conveyed to one alone who may, perhaps, become a burden and
annoyance to his associates, but two or more of the same origin and status
shall be joined in the aforesaid transaction.
TITLE LXVIII.
CONCERNING CERTAIN LANDS, AND CHILDREN BORN TO
SERFS ATTACHED TO THE IMPERIAL DOMAIN, AND OTHER
PERSONS OF FREE CONDITION.
1. The Emperor Zeno.
If a free serf, of either sex, should marry a Tamiac man or woman, the children
who are the issue of a union of this kind shall be considered Imperial serfs.
If, however, a serf attached to the glebe, or a slave belonging to another,
should marry a female serf or slave belonging to the Imperial domain, or a
female serf or slave should marry a male serf or slave attached to the Imperial
domain, the children born of such a marriage will be free, and We order that
they shall enjoy the rights conferred by the ancient laws.
2. The Emperor Justinian.
We remember that a pragmatic sanction was promulgated which provided that when
Tamiac estates situated in the provinces, as well as Gomatic lands subject to
certain impositions (that is to say to land-taxes and tributes) were sold, the
price paid for the same must be deposited in the Public Treasury, but although,
by the said pragmatic sanction, the most complete validity is given to
contracts of sale of this description, still, in order to grant perpetual
security to the purchaser, We do hereby order that by the terms of this
Constitution all such purchases shall have an indisputable title to such lands.
TITLE LXIX.
CONCERNING DIFFERENT URBAN AND RUSTIC ESTATES BELONGING TO TEMPLES AND CITIES
AND ALL CIVIL
REVENUES.
1. The Emperor Julian.
Where any persons erect buildings upon public lands, they shall be compelled to
pay a fixed rent for the same.
2. The Same Emperors.
The cities of Pamphilia, as well as all others, shall have an indefeasible
right to any property they may acquire.
3. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Our Beloved Vincent.
It is certain that the third part of the tax payable annually on account of
ground and lands belonging to the State is abundantly sufficient to provide for
the repair of the public walls.
Given at Milan, on the third of the Nonesof July, during the Consulate of
Olybrius and Probinus, 395.
4. The Same Emperors.
We decree that those who have offered the highest price for property belonging
to the Imperial domain, or to the temples, and have been or may become the
possessors of the same, shall have the indisputable ownership of said land, and
that, hereafter, there shall be no question as to the right of possession of
any of them, but each one shall hold the property as his own, where the
contract is fulfilled by the payment of the purchase-money.
5. The Emperor Valerian.
If any persons, after the Consulate of Ausonius and Olybrius, should, either by
way of donation or purchase, or under any other title whatsoever acquire lands,
houses, or warehouses owned by a municipality (and particularly to this Eternal
City to which We owe especial favor), or any real property belonging to the
Director of the Games, none of which are subject to any civil imposition, We
order that the same tax shall be imposed upon them to which their former
proprietors were liable, and which shall be established by having recourse to
the records of the municipality 'to which said property belongs, for if We do
not suffer the debts due to private individuals to be evaded, there is much
more reason why what is legally due to cities should be liquidated, as it is
sufficient for the possessors to pay the imposition for the sake of securing
the perpetual ownership which they have acquired through Our indulgence.
Those who, at present, hold lands belonging to municipalities, shall discharge
their obligations to the Treasury of Our Imperial Largesses, whether the lands
have never been exempt from taxation, or it has subsequently been imposed, and
if this law does not have reference
to them, they should pay the tax to which they are now liable to Our private
Treasury, as is customary, and the title to said property shall, in like
manner, remain forever indisputably vested in them and their successors.
6. The Emperor Zeno.
We order, by this law, which shall be valid for all time, that the right to
collect forty solidiannually, a tax imposed upon property situated in the
territory of the City of Apamena by the possessors of the same, that is to say,
Callimachus, Eliburnus, Emptorius, Vera-torius, and Epotius, shall be restored
to the City of Nicea and its inhabitants, after the expiration of the third
indiction.
Everything which was enacted by the law of the Emperor Martian, of Divine
Memory, to the prejudice of the said City of Nicea, is hereby annulled, and
whatever was granted by the said laws to the City, and which has in the
meantime, under any pretext, been diminished shall, by the authority of Our
present Constitution, be restored to the said cities, so that no judicial
authority, nor any Imperial Rescript which may at any time be produced will, in
any way, affect the validity of this frequently referred to general law.
If anyone should violate its provisions, he shall be severely punished.
TITLE LXX.
CONCERNING THE LEASING OP LANDS OWNED BY CITIES,
OR BELONGING TO THE TREASURY, THE TEMPLES, AND THE
PRIVATE OR PUBLIC IMPERIAL DEMESNES.
1. The Emperors Gratian, Theodosius, and Arcadius.
It is provided by an order of Our Divine Father that lands belonging to Our
private domain shall be transferred by perpetual lease in such a way as to be
at the risk of the officials making the transfer. For no one can fail to
discharge his duty if the lands are assigned by judicial decree to persons who
are solvent, or what is due to the Treasury be, in this way, properly secured,
and when either one of these things is neglected, the rent can be collected
from the property of the officials responsible for the transfer.
2. The Same Emperors to Nibrius.
In accordance with an ancient law, lands belonging to the State should not be
taken away from those to whom they have not been leased, and who have not been
authorized by Us to hold them (when persons have fraudulently obtained
possession of the same), provided they have improved them by diligent
cultivation, and permission has subsequently been granted to occupy them.
3. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius.
All lands and estates belonging to the government, which have been offered at
auction, and have, in conformity to law, been disposed of to the highest
bidder, shall be leased to him in perpetuity.
4. The Same Emperors to Minervius, Count of Private Affairs.
It is consonant with the principles of equity for ancient possessors of public
lands to be preferred to recent lessees, if they are willing to pay a higher
rent.
5. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Volusianus, Praetorian Prefect.
Lands belonging to Our private domain which have once been leased in
perpetuity, either directly by Our authority, or by that of Our illustrious
Count of the Private Treasury, or which may be leased to anyone hereafter in
this manner, cannot be transferred in perpetuity to another. For, by the
present Edict, We decree that the possession of property leased in perpetuity
cannot be transferred, even if the Emperor himself should sanction it, either
upon request or voluntarily, by a written annotation or a pragmatic sanction.
If the illustrious Count of Private Affairs should consent to a proceeding of
this kind, in violation of the provisions of this law, he himself shall be
compelled to pay a hundred pounds of gold by way of fine, and his subordinates
shall be required to pay the same amount to the Imperial Treasury, and no order
of this kind shall have any validity after the promulgation of this law, nor
shall the land be leased to another, even though he may be willing to pay a
higher rent.
Therefore, every person making a contract under a perpetual lease shall be
secure, and he is informed that the property leased to him cannot be taken away
from him or his heirs, or from those into whose hands it may come, either by
inheritance, donation, sale or under any other title whatsoever. And in order
that the Imperial generosity may not be circumscribed, the Emperor can bestow
property forming part of his private domain in perpetuity to anyone in
possession of the same, if he desires to do so, whether the former has himself
obtained it directly from Us, or has acquired it by any other title, for to
relinquish payment of the rent is a favor which does not injure another, where
the Emperor desires him to be designated as the owner, who formerly held the
property under a perpetual lease.
And, indeed, if anyone should be found to have obtained any of Our land, not
under a perpetual lease but under a temporary one, by the authority of the
illustrious Count of Private Affairs, this circumstance will offer no obstacle
to the generosity of the Emperor if he should wish to transfer to another as a
donation what the party in possession had only leased for a specified time.
Again, if an increased rent should be offered by someone else for land of this
description, the first tenant to whom the property was temporarily leased will
have the right to retain the said land, if he offers as much as the other has
done. Where, however, he acquired the said property under a perpetual lease, he
shall remain in undisturbed possession of the same, as previously stated.
TITLE LXXI.
CONCERNING LESSEES AND AGENTS, OR COLLECTORS OF
LANDS BELONGING TO THE TREASURY OP THE IMPERIAL
HOUSEHOLD.
1. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Bassus, Prasto-rian Prefect.
Lessees and other persons employed on the lands of the Imperial household,
whenever any question arises with reference to the same requiring judicial
investigation, must either defend or bring lawsuits as all other persons are
legally required to do. And they shall not meddle with the business of other
litigants, or officiously protect them, even when authorized to do so by a
judicial decision, or, by turbulent and violent acts, dare to interfere with
the execution of the law.
Nor shall they busy themselves with any matters either public or private, nor
inform against any quiet household, lest they may afterwards repent of their
thoughtless pertinacity, for a severe penalty is imposed upon those who are
under Our immediate control, and are obliged to obey Our commands.
Given at Ravenna, on the day before the Nonesof March, during the Consulate of
Theodosius, Consul for the twelfth time, and Valentinian, Consul for the second
time.
TITLE LXXII.
WHAT PERSONS ARE NOT PERMITTED TO LEASE LANDS BELONGING TO THE TREASURY.
1. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Nestorius, Count of Private Affairs.
No Palatine, who is attached to Our private service, has authority to lease
property belonging to Our private domain, either in his own name or in that of
anyone else whomsoever, for We do not allow this to be done by one who is a
soldier or a decurion.
Given on the sixth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Vincentius
and Fravitta, 401.
TITLE LXXIII.
CONCERNING CONTRIBUTIONS IMPOSED UPON LANDS BELONGING TO THE TREASURY, TO THE
PRIVATE DOMAIN OF THE EMPEROR, TO THE STATE, OR TO TEMPLES.
1. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Firminus, Count of the Imperial
Largesses.
We grant permission to ordinary judges, as well as to the Governors of
provinces, to decide questions arising between the stewards or
lessees of Our private domain, but we reserve for the Receivers of Our Private
Treasury the right to collect any sums which may be due.
2. The Same Emperors to Messala.
Officers of the palace who have been given public letters by the illustrious
Count of Private Affairs for the purpose of assisting collectors of the
revenue, in order that the amounts due from the lands of Our private domain may
the more readily be paid, are hereby directed to perform their duty with the
greatest diligence, and if they should act rashly, they shall be reported by
the ordinary judges to Your Highness, so that they may be severely dealt with.
3. The Same Emperors.
All lands, not only those which, for a long time, have belonged to Our private
domain, but also those which have become the property of the Treasury through
confiscation, shall not be released from pecuniary obligations by virtue of any
privileges and exemptions of this kind; but notice is hereby given that every
species of contribution, tax, and imposition shall be required of them, and
collected without deduction.
TITLE LXXIV.
CONCERNING THE PRIVILEGES ENJOYED BY LANDS ATTACHED TO THE IMPERIAL HOUSEHOLD,
AND THOSE BELONGING TO THE PRIVATE DOMAIN OF THE EMPEROR, AND FROM WHAT
CONTRIBUTIONS THEY ARE EXEMPT.
1. The Emperor Constantine.
It is settled that lands belonging to Our private domain shall be exempt from
all ignoble services, nor shall the lessees of the same or the serfs attached
to them be subjected to any extraordinary impositions or additional charges.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of Placidus
and Romulus, 347.
2. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius.
For the sake of lightening the burdens of the people of the provinces, We
desire that Our private estates shall be liable to the same contribution that
all others are, but whenever grain is transported through places where it is
not usual to carry it, and where it can be conveyed through other uninhabited
regions, this rule will be violated, for the said grain should not be
transported where it will cause any inconvenience or loss to the inhabitants of
the provinces, hence, Your Excellency will cause it to be transported by the
same route that was formerly taken.
3. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius.
We order that the money paid as rent for lands belonging to Our private-domain,
which have been leased in perpetuity, shall, like those
of private individuals, be subject to the contributions imposed in behalf of
applications for admission to corporate bodies.
4. The Same Emperors to Asclepiodotus, Praetorian Prefect.
We, by no means, include among ignoble services the construction of public
highways, bridges, and works erected in honor of Our Imperial predecessors.
Therefore, no class of men, of whatever rank or dignity, shall be exempt from
assessments for the construction and repair of highways and bridges, and We
also include the Imperial palaces in the provision.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof March, during the
Consulate of Asclepiodotus and Marianus, 423.
5. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Flavian, Prse-torian Prefect.
We decree that all the possessors of land hereinbefore mentioned shall, without
any exception but the occupants of Our private domain, be liable to the
contributions prescribed, the revenues of which We have frequently set apart
for the requirements of the public welfare.
Given at Ravenna, on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate
of Bassus and Antiochus, 431.
TITLE LXXV. CONCERNING THE IMPERIAL STUD.
1. The Emperors Arcadius and Honoring to Csesarius, Praetorian Prefect.
All persons, from the highest to the lowest, are notified by an edict to be
published by Your Highness that they will be liable to a fine of a pound of
gold for every horse or mare, whether they are Hermo-genians or Palmates, which
they take away, unless they voluntarily restore them; and those who are proved
to have removed animals from any other drove shall be compelled to pay a fine
of six ounces of gold to Our Treasury.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Kalendsof December, during the
Consulate of Olybrius and Probinus, 395.
TITLE LXXVI. CONCERNING THE IMPERIAL PALACES AND BUILDINGS.
1. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to John,. Count of Private Affairs.
We except all buildings which are set apart for Us, that is to say, the
Imperial palaces, from the use and occupation of private persons.
TITLE LXXVII.
CYPRESS TREES FROM THE SACRED GROVES OF DAPHNE AND PERSEUS IN EGYPT SHALL NOT
BE CUT DOWN,
OR SOLD.
1. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Sylvanus, Count of Private Affairs.
If anyone should purchase cypress trees cut down in the sacred groves of Daphne
in Syria, or of Perseus in Egypt, he is notified that he will be fined five
pounds of gold; and he who dares to sell the trees, which no one is permitted
to purchase, shall be liable to the same penalty.
2. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Eudoxius, Prse-torian Prefect.
All judges, of whatever rank, are hereby notified that hereafter, without the
consent of Your Highness, permission will be refused them to cut down any trees
in the sacred grove of Daphne at Antioch, or even to remove such as have fallen
for any cause whatsoever. Nor can it be asserted by the Alytarch that he has
the right to cut down a single cypress, for the reason that he has planted
others.
And, lest it may appear that by denying him permission to cut down a cypress We
are depriving him of a privilege of long standing, without compensation, We
decree that he shall receive a pound of gold from Our Private Treasury for
every cypress which he was entitled to cut down, and anyone who violates this
law shall be condemned to pay a fine of fifty pounds of gold.











THE CODE OF OUR LORD
THE MOST HOLY EMPEROR JUSTINIAN.
SECOND EDITION.
BOOK XII.
TITLE I. CONCERNING DIGNITIES.
1. The Emperor Antoninus.
If as you state, your grandfather was of consular dignity, and your father had
held the office of Pnetor, and you did not marry men of private condition, but
those of illustrious rank, you will retain tne eminent position of your family.
Without date or designation of Consulate.
2. The Emperor Alexander.
The gates of dignities do not lie open to men of bad reputation who are branded
with infamy, and whose wickedness, baseness of life, and evil repute exclude
them from the society of respectable people.
3. The Emperor Gordian.
The highest dignity does not abrogate the privileges of an inferior rank,
previously obtained, or those attaching to military service.
4. The Emperor Philip.
We order that property belonging to senators, which they possess in different
cities and provinces, and their retainers, shall be exempt from furnishing
transportation, and any other requirements imposed by judges, as well as from
all ignoble, extraordinary, and debasing services, and neither they nor their
children shall, under any circumstances, be compelled to perform duties
inconsistent with their rank.
5. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus.
No urban Prefect shall, without Our authority or knowledge, subject a senator
to the performance of any civil obligation whatsoever, and no one shall inflict
such an atrocious injury upon Our Senate. For it is reserved for Us to issue
any commands to persons of senatorial rank, as whatever is done by Our order
becomes a distinction.
6. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian.
Let no one who belongs to the lowest class of merchants, brokers, or persons
engaged in vile or abject pursuits and employments, or who occupy base or
dishonorable positions, attempt to enjoy any dignity. Anyone who has obtained
such a place shall be deprived of it, and shall be restored to his former
status.
7. The Same Emperors and Csesars.
When different judges require public works to be erected in cities, the
property of senators shall not be liable to contribute to expenses of this
kind.
8. The Emperor Julian to Sallust, Prsstorian Prefect.
The rights of senators and the authority of their order (in which We Ourselves
are also included) must be protected from all injury.
Given at Constantinople, on the ninth of February, during the Consulate of
Mammertinus and Nevitta.
9. The Same Emperor and Csesars.
We forbid the children of freedmen to attain to the dignity of nobles.
10. The Emperors Valens, Gratian, and Valentinian to Gracchus, Prsetorian
Prefect.
We exempt men of illustrious rank from liability to torture. Given on the day
before the Nonesof January, during the Consulate of Gratian, Consul for the
fourth time, and Merobaudus, 377.
11. The Emperor Constantine.
If a senator, or any other man of illustrious rank, has children born to him
before he was raised to the above-mentioned dignity (which rule applies to sons
as well as to daughters), they will follow the condition of their father. As
children should not be excluded from the honors enjoyed by their fathers, a
child born to a senator or other person of illustrious rank must be considered
to be invested with that same rank and dignity.
12. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Neo-therius,
Prsetorian Prefect.
Judges who have been convicted of having been polluted by dishonesty and other
crimes shall be deprived of their commissions and dignities, and degraded to
the lowest rank of plebeians, nor shall they afterwards enjoy those honors of
which they have shown themselves to be unworthy.
Given at Thessalonica, on the eighteenth of the Kalendsof February, during the
Consulate of Gratian, Consul for the fifth time, and Theodosius, 380.
13. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens.
We raise women to the rank of their husbands, render them noble by birth,
determine the jurisdiction to which they shall be subject, and change the
places of their domicile. Moreover, if they should subsequently marry men of
inferior position, they shall be deprived of their former dignity, and shall
follow the condition of their last husbands.
Given at Constantinople, on the fourth of the Kalendsof February, 1 during the
Consulate of Arcadius, Consul for the second time, and Rufinus, 392.
14. The Emperors Gratian and Theodosius.
We order that judges shall not have power to impose any public service upon a
senator under any pretext whatsoever, no matter to what province he may belong.
15. The Same Emperors to Eustathius, Prefect of the City.
We grant authority to all persons of noble or illustrious rank to reside in any
place whatsoever, and to journey and remain wherever they wish, without
obtaining a permit to do so.
16. The Same Emperors and Arcadius to Apollonius, Prsetorian Prefect.
When any serious crime has been perpetrated by a person of eminent rank, and he
has been liberated under bond, We order that the accusation shall be submitted
to Us. Any charges involving persons of inferior position must be referred to
Your Highness, in order that you may decide what course should be pursued with
reference to the offence 'which has been committed.
17. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Arcadius, Pr&-torian Prefect.
Whenever any civil or criminal action is brought by a private individual
against a person of illustrious rank, he shall not be annoyed by being
compelled to give bond; but, by a special privilege, he shall bbeeplaced upon his
honor, and only his oath shall be exacted as security. If, however, anyone
should neglect to do this, and should fail to take the oath required as
security, either in his own proper person, or by his attorney, the judge having
jurisdiction shall order (in pecuniary actions) that the property in dispute
shall be placed in possession of those who are entitled to it by the authority
of the law and the nature of the case.
In criminal matters, however, the accused party shall be deprived of the
dignity of which he has rendered himself unworthy through perjury, and the
judge is authorized to pronounce the sentence prescribed by the severity of the
law upon the defendant as being deprived of his illustrious rank by his own
crime, without referring the case to Us for consideration.
(1) We think that the following privilege should be added to those enjoyed by
persons of illustrious rank, that is to say, persons of this kind should not be
compelled to appear in court in either civil or criminal proceedings, except in
pursuance of a written order.
18. The Emperor Justinian.
We order that, with the exception of the honor attaching to Imperial notices of
recall, all inferior and superior magistrates invested with authority, as well
as those who are designated illustrious shall, without first obtaining Our
permission, be allowed to visit this Imperial Capital, whether they have
formerly left it with the consent of the Emperor, or whether, residing in the
provinces, they come here only when their business requires it.
TITLE II.
CONCERNING PRAETORS, PRAETORIAN HONORS, AND THE
ABOLITION OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS KNOWN AS GLEBE,
LEAF, AND SEVEN SOLIDI.
1. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius.
No one of illustrious or noble rank who resides in a province shall, hereafter,
be called to the Prefecture, but everyone of such persons shall remain safely
and securely at home, in the enjoyment of his dignity.
2. The Same Emperors to the Senate.
We order that the impositions known as "glebe," "leaf," and "seven solidi,"of
every description, whether they have reference to persons or to property, shall
be absolutely abolished, and that no contributions of this kind shall,
hereafter, be exacted.
TITLE III.
CONCERNING CONSULS, AND THE PROHIBITION AGAINST THEIR SQUANDERING MONEY, AND
CONCERNING PREFECTS, MILITARY COMMANDERS, AND PATRICIANS.
1. The Emperor Valentinian.
It was long since established, with reference to men of consular rank, that, as
they were invested with the same honor and enjoyed the same privileges, those
should take precedence who are superior only in point of time of service. For
who of several persons possessing the same dignity should be considered
entitled to priority unless the one who first obtained the position? He who
subsequently became Consul, although he held the same office, should certainly
give place to a predecessor.
This rule shall also be observed where anyone has repeatedly held the office of
Consul; for, where the official insignia are frequently obtained, while they
prove the virtues and the merits of the incumbent, they do not increase them,
because nothing is added to the eminence of the position. Where, however, a
Consul who has held one office after another acquires the dignity of patrician,
he will be entitled to precedence over one who first secured that dignity,
although he may have been more recently raised to patrician rank.
2. The Emperor Leo.
We wish to restore the Order of the Consulate to its ancient splendor, so that
persons who obtain that honor may do so through their merits, and not by
cultivating the favor of the people, and, laying aside the desire for gain, the
candidates may have in view only the venerable practice of their ancestors and
the auspicious ornaments of antiquity which are peculiar to the office.
Therefore, We desire that other Consuls shall have this example before them,
and We shall not suffer them to incur great expense to no purpose. Hence,
Consuls shall, hereafter, abstain from the vile practice of scattering money
among the populace, and what they lose in this way and formerly squandered
without any compensating advantage should be employed for better purposes, and
in measures contributory to the public welfare. If, at the beginning of every
consulate, a hundred pounds of gold is paid by the Consuls for the maintenance
of the aqueduct of this great city, each of them will know that this sum has
been given for the benefit of his country, and that what has been bestowed will
remain a perpetual evidence of his generosity,
3. The Emperor Zeno.
No one shall be permitted to attain to the high rank of the patriciate (which
takes precedence of all others) unless he has first held the office of Consul,
that of the Praetorian Prefecture of the East, or of Illyria, or of the City,
or is known to have been a general of the army, or to have occupied the
position of Master of the Offices, as only per-
sons of this kind who are at present administering these public employments, or
may do so hereafter, shall be permitted to attain the dignity of patrician,
when We desire to confer it.
And, as We think that, in all respects, We should consult the interests of this
Most Glorious City, which is the capital of the entire world, We order that all
those who shall, hereafter, by the favor of the Emperor, be invested with the
eminent dignity of honorary Consul, shall pay a hundred pounds of gold for the
purpose of repairing the public aqueduct, just as those who, for a year, are
elevated to the consular office, for it is only proper that this Most
Flourishing City, by the munificent donation of a hundred pounds of gold,
should be reminded of the benefits resulting from the bestowal of the honorary
consulate.
4. The Same Emperor to Sebastian, Prsetorian Prefect.
We decree that all those who, up to this time, have been honorary Consuls, or
who may become so hereafter, can, with the permission of the Emperor, conduct
the business of the Consulate for a year, and that, having done so, they shall
not be considered as having obtained any new distinction, or one which they
have not yet acquired, but shall be considered to have again enjoyed the
benefit of the consulship to which their honorary rank has already entitled
them; and with reference to the adoration of the Imperial dignity, or any other
honors and privileges which the Consuls could claim in former times, they are
notified that the rank of Consul will date from the time when they were first
appointed.
It should also be observed that where anyone of consular dignity afterwards
becomes actual Consul, he shall not again be obliged to contribute a hundred
pounds of gold for the maintenance of the aqueducts of this Glorious City, in
accordance with the tenor of this Imperial constitution, as these were paid
when he was raised to the position of honorary Consul.
5. The Emperor Justinian to John, Prsetorian Prefect.
We order that all those illustrious men whom We have raised to the high rank of
patrician shall immediately, upon receipt of the Imperial commission, become
the heads of households, and be released from paternal authority, lest it may
appear that those who are honored by Us as fathers shall not be subject to the
control of others. For, indeed, it would be intolerable for a father to be
able, by emancipation, to release his son from the bonds of his authority, but
that the Emperor should not have the power to free from the control of another
one whom he has chosen to occupy the position of father to himself; for, if the
contrary opinion did not prevail, the majesty of the Emperor would appear to be
diminished by such an assumption. And while it is certain that this very rarely
happens, as the son of a family does not often attain to the honor of
patrician, although this is customary in the case of Consuls, still, in order
that such an occurrence may not at some time take place, and no law be found
applicable, We have decided that this Constitution shall be promulgated by Us.
TITLE IV.
CONCERNING PRAETORIAN AND URBAN PREFECTS AND MILITARY COMMANDERS.
1. The Emperor Valentinian.
We place the Prefect of the City, the Prsetorian Prefect, and the generals of
cavalry and infantry in the same class, so far as their rank is concerned, as
We desire that after they have retired to private life, those will take
precedence who first, in order of time, have obtained promotion and the
commissions which conferred their offices upon them.
2. The Emperor Leo.
A general of cavalry or infantry shall take precedence over anyone appointed
Prefect, when both have relinquished this office and become private citizens,
provided he was appointed before him; and, therefore, he who was first selected
and the distinction of whose magistracy is of more ancient date shall take
precedence in voting and speaking over a more recent appointee.
TITLE V.
CONCERNING THE IMPERIAL CHAMBERLAINS, AND VALETS-DE-CHAMBRE AND THEIR
PRIVILEGES.
1. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius.
The officials having charge of the Imperial bedchamber shall enjoy the same
rank as that conferred upon the Prsetorian or Urban Prefects or upon those
exercising the authority of generals of the army, so that, after they have
relinquished the duties of their employment, no distinction shall be made
between them, either in the solemnities accompanying the adoration of the
Emperor, or in the solemn festivities, assemblies, attendance at court, or any
other ceremony in which they may be called upon to take part. In such cases,
the order observed shall be regulated by the date of their appointment, and
they shall wear their usual costume, as it has been clearly decreed that he
shall take precedence whose appointment was first in order of time, and that he
shall rank second whose nomination is shown to be more recent.
2. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Proculus, Prse-torian Prefect.
We order by this law, which shall be perpetually observed, that all officials
of the Imperial bedchamber, after having retired from office, shall, before
they are reappointed to the same places (with the exception of the Chamberlain
of the Camp and Count of the Household) enjoy the following privilege, that is
to say, they shall not hereafter be obliged by Your Highness to furnish post-
horses, vehicles, or lodgings, nor sha.ll they be required to perform ignoble
services, lest they may,
during the time of leisure and quiet, appear to lose the honors which they have
obtained by service; and We decree that their houses, both in this Imperial
City and in all towns whatsoever, shall be free from the annoyance of
furnishing lodgings to anyone, no matter what his rank may be. If the Governors
of provinces and their subordinate officers either connive at the violation of
this Our law, or contravene its provisions in any way, they shall be fined ten
pounds of gold.
3. The Emperor Martian to John, Count and Master of the Offices.
As it is certain that the officials of My Imperial bedchamber, as well as those
of the August Empress, perform the same duties, and have access to the same
secret apartments of the palace, they should not be subject to different
jurisdictions, and We release them from obedience to the orders of other
tribunals, so that they can only defend themselves against actions brought
before Your Highness.
4. The Emperor Leo, to Puseus, Prsetorian Prefect.
We decree that all slaves who have been donated by anyone for attendance in the
Imperial bedchamber, or who may hereafter be given or appointed for such a
purpose, and who formerly were or hereafter may be attached to the service of
the Emperor (even though the appointment may not have been made in writing)
shall, after they have been associated with the other chamberlains, become free
and freeborn, and be considered such, and We desire that this rule shall not
only apply to those who are living, but also to all who are dead. For as this
privilege is considered to be peculiar to the majesty of the Emperor, namely,
that he should not make use of the services of slaves, as men of private
condition do, but of those of freemen, it is extremely unjust that they alone
should suffer the inconveniences incident to inferior rank.
It shall be lawful for such persons, just as in the case of others who enjoy
the advantages of free birth, to make wills disposing of their estates, but no
one must entertain any doubt that the property of such of them as die intestate
will escheat to the Treasury as that of decedents who have left no lawful
heirs.
We desire all these regulations to be diligently observed where persons have
voluntarily given an eunuch to be employed in the duties of the Imperial
bedchamber. If, however, the eunuch should have been placed there by force, or
should have ventured to undertake the service of the Imperial bedchamber
without the consent or knowledge of his master, the latter is authorized to
invoke the aid of the law, and recover (together with his -peculium}him whom he
can prove is his slave, and who, without his knowledge or consent, has entered
the service of the Imperial bedchamber.
As, however, it is not proper for persons who have been injured to be denied
the power of applying for relief, so We do not permit that the way for bringing
vexatious lawsuits shall remain open too long, and therefore We fix the term of
five years within which a master can institute proceedings against such slaves;
and if he should fail to act
within that time, he shall not be permitted either to claim the slave and his
peculium,or even the property of his freedman as his own. All these rules which
We have laid down with reference to the male attendants of Our bedchamber are
also applicable to any females who have been or may be donated for this
service, and We decree that they shall govern them and continue to be in force
whether the said attendants are living or dead.
5. The Emperor Anastasius to Eusebius, Master of the Offices.
We order that the two illustrious chamberlains of Ourself and Our Consort, the
Empress, after having finished their terms of service, and having been raised
to senatorial rank, shall have a right to wear the military belt whenever they
visit their estates, or travel for any purpose, as this is conceded in
compliance with their wishes, and will result in no one's injury.
TITLE VI.
CONCERNING QUAESTORS, MASTERS OF THE OFFICES, AND COUNTS OF THE IMPERIAL
LARGESSES AND OF PRIVATE
AFFAIRS.
1. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius.
Those who have been honored with the office of Quaestor or Master of the
Offices, or have been Counts of either of Our Treasuries, shall be received
with the usual acclamations and shall not be passed by as unknown.
TITLE VII.
CONCERNING THE PRIMICERIUS, THE SECUNDICERIUS, AND
NOTARIES.
1. The Emperor Leo.
We especially desire that notaries shall always retain their title; and
therefore, if any members of this order retire in order to be at rest, or
resign their offices, or relinquish them on account of old age, or should
subsequently attain to any other dignity, they shall not lay aside the title
obtained from their former employment, but shall add to it that of their
subsequent dignity; and if any official, and especially if anyone attached to
the office of Your Highness, should rashly charge a former notary with any
duties pertaining to the collection of taxes, the assessment of property, or
anything else of this kind, he is hereby notified that as soon as he is
detected, even though he may only have been guilty of negligence, he shall be
heavily fined and excluded from .the corps of accountants.
2. The Emperor Justinian.
We think that the eminent and noble body of tribunes of the Notaries who render
important services to the public should be encouraged
and increased by the bestowal of distinctions and privileges; hence We have
deemed it proper to decide that those who have attained to the rank of
primiceriusshall remain in the office for the term of two years. Moreover, We
order that those tribunes who, being occupied in their own affairs, absent
themselves from the Imperial palace for a year, even though they may have
obtained a permit to do so, shall lose one grade on account of their absence
for that time; and if they should be absent for two years, they shall lose two
grades; and if for three years, they shall lose three; and if for four years,
they shall, in like manner, be subjected to the loss of four grades; and be
placed below those who formerly were inferior to them in rank. Those who have
failed to appear for a period of five continuous years shall have their names
stricken from the registers of tribunes, but shall not be excluded from the
Order, for men who are in this condition can perform none of the duties
relating to the census, the imposition of taxes, the assessment of property, or
any other matters of this kind.
We have considered it especially necessary to establish these rules in order
that no one may, through political intrigue, official favor, or any other means
whatsoever, attain to a rank to which he is not entitled, and take precedence
of others without reference to service while transacting his own business.
When any tribune, after long and arduous service, is forced to retire on
account of age, he shall, after having ceased to act as primice-riusand chief
accountant, obtain the rank of Master of the Offices, just as if he had
discharged the duties of the latter, and shall wear the insignia of the same,
according to ancient custom, and he can assume priority over all others even
though they may have preceded him in point of time.
TITLE Vill.
CONCERNING THE MAINTENANCE OF THE ORDER OF DIGNITIES.
1. The Emperor Theodosius.
If anyone should usurp a place to which he is not entitled, he cannot defend
himself on the plea of ignorance, but he shall undoubtedly be considered guilty
of sacrilege, as having disregarded the Imperial mandates.
Given at Milan, on the twelfth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of
Richomer and Clearchus, 384.
2. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian.
All persons are notified that the order of precedence shall be observed as
follows: those who are performing the functions of an illustrious employment
shall have the first rank; next come those who have formerly held such an
office, and at present have a right to wear the
military belt, the badge of illustrious dignity; and We assign the third place
to those to whom the insignia of illustrious rank have been sent; fourth, those
who, being present, have obtained honorary distinction through Our letters,
without the military belt; and fifth, those who, while absent, have been
invested with the insignia of illustrious dignity, without the military belt.
We decree that the administrators, or Counts of Private Affairs, shall take
precedence of those upon whom have been bestowed the honorary titles of
illustrious dignity.
We do not, however, think that all those who, at present, are engaged in the
public service should always be entitled to priority over such as are merely
invested with the honorary title, but only where the parties are of the same
rank, and one of them has the administration, as well as the honors, and the
other the honors alone. Hence, the Prefect takes precedence of the Qusestor,
and not the Quaestor of the Prefect; and, in like manner, the active Qusestor
takes precedence of the Qusestor who is not in office; and the Count of the
Treasury, or the Count of Private Affairs, shall be preferred to an honorary
Quses-tor or Master of the Offices.
We decree that those should be numbered among the incumbents of offices who,
being of illustrious rank, have, in Our Imperial Consistory, been previously
entrusted with matters of ordinary importance, or whom We may hereafter charge
with such duties; for example, where the prosecution of hostilities is
committed to some general not in active service. For why, for instance, should
not the distinguished general, Germanus, whom We have ordered to conduct a war
against the enemy, be considered as discharging the duties of such an office?
Or why should not the eminent Propentadius who, being a soldier, We have
appointed, instead of the Praetorian Prefect, to superintend the organization
of the army, be said to administer the Prefecture?
TITLE IX. CONCERNING THE CHIEFS OF THE IMPERIAL BUREAUS.
1. The Emperor Anastasius.
The indulgence of Our liberality should be bestowed upon the distinguished
Chiefs of the Imperial Bureaus who, in the capacity of secretaries are, as it
were, associated with the Emperor; and therefore We decree that, after they
have relinquished their office, they shall be exempt from all contributions,
whether these are imposed by civil or military authority, and that they shall
be absolutely free from the annoyance of being compelled to submit to any
contribution, public or private, that may be imposed by Your Highness.
We desire that this privilege shall also be transmitted to their descendants,
and by the latter to their next of kin. The office of Your Highness shall be
condemned to pay a fine of fifty pounds of gold, if you permit this law to be
violated in any respect whatever.
TITLE X. CONCERNING THE COUNTS OF THE CONSISTORY.
1. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosian.
Generally speaking, We decree that those upon whom the title of Count of Our
Consistory has been conferred shall be deemed equal in rank to the
distinguished Proconsuls.
2. The Emperor Justinian.
The distinguished Counts of Our Consistory, together with their wives, their
children, and their slaves, shall enjoy the same privileges in bringing actions
at law, and in defending the same, as the illustrious chiefs of the guild of
agents are entitled to, in accordance with the Imperial Pragmatic Sanction of
the Emperor Zeno, of Divine Memory.
TITLE XI.
CONCERNING THE COUNTS AND TRIBUNES OF ASSOCIATIONS.
1. The Emperor Valentinian.
The chiefs and tribunes of the various associations whose members serve at the
Imperial banquets, and from former times have enjoyed the privilege of adoring
the Emperor (among whom are included the Counts of the Imperial Stables, and
those having charge of the palace), where they have been invested with the
title of Count of the First Rank and have not attained to a higher dignity, We
order shall, after they have relinquished their office, be classed with the
Counts of Egypt or Pontus, whose relative position is the same. We order that
those who have not risen to a more exalted degree of nobility shall, after they
have retired from service, be considered equal in dignity to the dukes of the
provinces.
TITLE XII. CONCERNING MILITARY COUNTS.
1. The Emperor Leo.
Those who, after having led armies in provinces beyond seas, have, in
consideration of their merits, obtained the rank of Count of the First Rank,
shall be entitled to the same honors as those who have been invested with the
insignia of the proconsulship.
2. The Emperor Anastasius.
We place in the same class with dukes who have administered their office in the
provinces (with the exception of those of Egypt and Pontus) all who have been
appointed by Our authority Counts of the First Rank, and dispatched with armies
for the protection and defence of any of the provinces, or have undertaken the
duties of generals.
TITLE XIII.
CONCERNING THE COUNTS AND CHIEF PHYSICIANS OF THE IMPERIAL PALACE.
1. The Emperor Zeno.
We decree that the Chief Physicians of the palace who have obtained the dignity
of Count of the First Rank shall hold the same position as vicegerents, whether
they have already retired from office, or may hereafter do so, in order that no
difference of degree may exist between the vicegerents and dukes who are still
administering their offices, and those who have obtained the title of Count of
the First Rank, except that arising from the length of time which he who is in
office or has attained the insignia of count may have served.
TITLE XIV. CONCERNING THE COUNTS WHO GOVERN THE PROVINCES.
1. The Emperor Zeno.
Those who have been occupied in the civil or judicial administration of the
government, and have become entitled to the rank of Count of the First Rank,
shall enjoy the privileges attaching to the office of Imperial Vicegerent,
after they have relinquished their official employments.
TITLE XV.
CONCERNING THE PROFESSORS WHO, BY GIVING INSTRUCTION IN THE CITY OF
CONSTANTINOPLE, HAVE ATTAINED TO THE RANK OF COUNT.
1. The Emperor Valentinian.
It has been decided that grammarians, both Greek and Latin, Sophists, and
jurists practicing their profession in this Imperial City, who being regularly
registered, have distinguished themselves for good morals, and can show that
they possess the ability to teach eloquence, as well as skill in
interpretation, and talent in debate, and who have been considered worthy of
becoming members of the Senate, after they have passed twenty years in their
profession, and in imparting knowledge, shall be honored, and placed in the
same class with the Imperial Vicegerents.
TITLE XVI. CONCERNING SILENTARII AND THEIR DECURIONS.
1. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius, to Ursus, Prefect of the City, and
Aurelian, Praetorian Prefect of Illyria.
The decurions of Our palace, after having faithfully performed their duties and
relinquished their office, shall have the choice of either
receiving from the Emperor the title of Master of the Offices or that of
illustrious Count of the Domestics, that is to say, the rank of those in active
service, so that they may enjoy the privilege not only of adoring the Emperor,
but also of saluting public officials, as well as all the other advantages
attaching to the above-mentioned dignities, in addition have the honor of being
present at the meetings of Our Imperial Consistory.
2. The Same Emperors to Venantius, Prsetorian Prefect.
Every decurion, or silentarius,shall be exempt from the service of furnishing
horses and other extraordinary impositions; nor shall he pay any tax which is
usually imposed under such circumstances, and no authority or necessity shall
subject him to anything of this kind.
3. The Emperor Valentinian.
Decurions and silentariiare notified by this law that all the privileges
formerly granted them by other Divine Emperors are hereby confirmed, even where
they have been promoted to a superior position, and their rights shall not be
prejudiced by the issue of any pragmatic sanction, nor shall the authority of
the Prefecture subject them to the necessity of furnishing post-horses or
lodgings; and We hereby release them from all ignoble services, from the
burning of lime, and from the charge of the superindiction.
We decree that their houses, not only in this Imperial City, but also
everywhere else, shall be exempt from providing lodgings, no matter by whom
this may be authorized, and a fine of ten pounds of gold shall be imposed upon
the judges of the provinces and their offices if they violate this Our law.
We add to the above-mentioned privileges, that the said decurions and
silentarii,after they have retired from office and have been included among the
illustrious senators, shall have a right to the honors of the curiawithout
performing any duties, and can rejoice in the full possession of their
dignities and immunities. Under this regulation, however, only thirty
silentariishall be entitled to this honorable distinction, and We decree that
three decurions, and no more, shall enjoy the above-mentioned privileges, after
they have discharged their official duties uninterruptedly for thirty
consecutive years.
4. The Same Emperor.
In order that the silentariimay not be removed from their places near Our
person to appear in court, We order that those who desire to bring either civil
or criminal actions against any member of the guild of silentarii,or his wife,
cannot proceed in any other tribunal than that of the distinguished Master of
the Offices.
5. The Emperor Justinian.
We order that the illustrious silentariiin service, when they are under the
control of their parents, shall possess as castrense peculium
whatever they may have obtained, or may hereafter acquire by way of emoluments,
donations, inheritance, or from any other source, while in office; nor can
their parents, if they survive them, claim such property for themselves, or
take it from them; nor, after their death, can their own brothers, or any other
of their heirs, divide the same as belonging to the estates of the said
deceased persons, as they cannot be deprived of the fruit and profits of their
labors. For the same reason, We do not permit the silentariito be compelled to
account for, or place in the mass of the estate of their deceased parents, any
property which they may have received from their relatives, or from any other
source, or which they may hereafter obtain, at the time that they were admitted
into the corps of the silentarii,and they shall not be assessed or compelled to
pay any money by way of contribution under such circumstances.
We order that they shall be exempt from the administration of guardianship and
curatorship, as they should not be obliged to transact the business of others;
for the reason that, on account of the services required of them by Us, they
cannot devote proper care or attention to their own affairs.
Moreover, their children, who have already reached or may hereafter attain to
the rank of distinguished counts or tribunes, shall, by no means, be compelled
to undertake or conduct the administration of the Prefecture without their
consent, and all privileges heretofore conferred upon those now in office shall
also be enjoyed by persons hereafter admitted to the same body, and this rule
shall apply not only while they are in active service, but also after their
retirement.
TITLE XVII. CONCERNING DOMESTICS AND PROTECTORS.
1. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens.
Domestics and protectors belonging to the royal palace shall have a right to
embrace the Imperial Vicegerents when they salute them, for it would
practically be an act of sacrilege if this honor were not allowed those who are
considered worthy of touching the Imperial purple.
2. The Same Emperors and Gratian.
The primiceriusof both the corps of domestics and protectors, after obtaining
the office of tribune, shall have the rank to which dukes are entitled; and
others of the same body, to the number of ten, shall enjoy the consular
dignity.
3. The Same Emperors to Sposaterus, Count of the Foot Domestics.
Any domestic who is absent, but not on public business nor under a permit
granted for that purpose, and fails for the space of two years to discharge the
duties which he owes to the Emperor, shall be
reduced five grades, and if he is proved to have been away for three
consecutive years, he shall be reduced ten. If he should be absent for four
years, he shall be assigned to the lowest place; and where he has been a
wanderer for the term of five years, he shall be deprived of the insignia of
his office; for those who discontinue the performance of their functions for so
long a time, when they should perform them assiduously, are unworthy of
membership in the order.
4. The Emperor Anastasius.
We have determined that it should be decreed and established by this pragmatic
sanction, which shall be perpetually observed, that where anyone has obtained
the place of secundiceriusin the corps of mounted domestics, and dies while
administering the office, his heirs shall have the right to his salary and
perquisites, not only for the remainder of that year, but also for the
following year, that is to say, during which he would have performed the duties
of primicerius,so that his heirs will be entitled to all his emoluments, just
as if he had survived until the expiration of his term of office.
TITLE XVIII.
CONCERNING THE SUPERINTENDENTS OF PUBLIC WORKS. 1. The Same Emperor.
Those who have been appointed by Us Superintendents of Public Works shall rank
as nobles entitled to the same position as persons of consular dignity, for
members of Our retinue are worthy of distinction.
TITLE XIX.
CONCERNING PERSONS ATTACHED TO THE OFFICE OF IMPERIAL SECRETARY, AND OTHERS WHO
ARE EMPLOYED IN
THE SAME.
1. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Cyne-gius, Prsetorian
Prefect.
We place the Imperial secretaries employed in drawing up memorials, letters,
petitions, and inventories in the same class as vicegerents, and declare them
entitled to the same rank as those who, as the subordinates of prefects, have
been appointed to the government of departments from the time when they
obtained the office. Such officials, who have subsequently been promoted to the
position of vicegerents, take precedence over others who have not yet attained
to that dignity, and shall not be liable to any ignoble service whatever.
2. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Con-stantius,
Prsetorian Prefect of the Gauls.
Those who serve in the offices of the Imperial Secretaries, and exercise the
functions of ordinary or distinguished judges, shall not be
summoned to court, or compelled to accept public employment against their will.
Superior officials, cornicularii,and the heads of departments are hereby
notified that they will be fined three pounds of gold, to be collected out of
their property, if they do not permit them to enter Our Consistory, or the
office of Secretary of the Judges, or if proper respect is not shown them when
they are admitted into the Imperial presence, or if they should be refused
permission to sit with the judges. Given on the sixth of the Idesof November,
during the Consulate of Timasius and Promotus, 389.
3. The Emperors Theodosius, Arcadius, and Honorius.
Those who are employed in the offices of the Secretary of the Imperial Palace,
that is to say if, after they have served for twenty years in drawing up
memorials, letters, petitions, and inventories, they should decide to retire,
shall be raised to the consular dignity, and they should, in consequence,
obtain the same honors as are usually conferred upon former Consuls; nor shall
anyone be permitted to annoy them by imposing any duty upon them, or by
ordering them to perform any service.
4. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius.
We order that the property of all those employed in the offices of the Imperial
Secretaries, that is to say, those who draw up memorials, letters, petitions,
and inventories, shall be secure and exempt from the imposition of any
compulsory contribution for ignoble purposes, and that the said persons shall
have no apprehension of an assessment, or any other exaction, and shall only be
liable to the payment of the usual tax; so that the dignity obtained by their
labor may not be subjected to any extraordinary burden, or be compelled to
contribute to the fund of vehicles or post-horses; and this shall apply to
anyone at present serving in said offices, as being the privilege and exemption
to which their long service and their industry entitle them.
We decree that this rule shall also apply to their estates, and that they shall
continue to enjoy this privilege, even though they may be promoted to a higher
position; so that no matter what their rank and fortune hereafter may be, they
will still profit by the advantages obtained by their service in the office of
the Imperial Secretaries.
5. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Faustinus, Prsetorian Prefect.
By way of granting a special favor, We order that those who are employed in the
offices of the Secretaries charged with drawing up memorials, letters, and
petitions shall, from the receivers to the Mello-proximi,obtain the dignity and
honor of nobles, and like the others who are serving in the same offices, shall
legally be entitled to attend the meetings of Our Council, just as ordinary
judges can do; so that they upon whom We have conferred this noble rank may
know that they can claim the same respect as other distinguished persons, and
be informed that they have received permission from Us to enter and sit in Our
Council.
Given at Ravenna, on the eighth of the Idesof June, during the Consulate of
Lucius, 413.
6. The Same Emperor and Valentinian.
We decree that, hereafter, those who are employed in the three bureaus of the
Secretaries' office having charge of memorials, letters, and petitions, shall
obtain the rank of Proximiafter one year's instead of two years' service, as
was formerly prescribed.
Given at Constantinople, on the eighth of the Idesof February, during the
Consulate of Theodosius, Consul for the seventh time, and Palladius, 416.
7. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Nomus, Master of the Offices.
We order that the promotion of persons employed in the offices of the Imperial
Secretaries shall be dependent upon their length of service, and that all
supernumeraries stationed in the said offices shall occupy the vacant places
which they may obtain, in the same order. This rule shall be applied in such a
way that no one who has been recently enrolled can aspire to a place to which
he has no right; except where he is found to be more competent to perform the
work, and has been decided to be worthy of promotion by the testimony of
fifteen of the employees of the said office of Secretary, and entitled to
precedence, which shall be confirmed by oath.
We desire that this rule shall be observed by everyone, with the exception of
the sons of those next in order of preferment. For We decree that each of those
shall cause one of his sons to be admitted into the order, with strict
reference to priority of time (even if he is known to be lax in the performance
of his duties), and he shall be preferred to those of more recent appointment,
but who are more competent. We order that any supernumerary, who has been
admitted as an active member, shall pay to the one next in succession the sum
of two hundred and fifty solidiand twenty or fifteen solidito the
Melloproximusor assistant, in compliance with the custom of each Secretary's
office.
If, however, any of the supernumeraries, with a view to avoiding paying the
money, should decline the promotion to which he is entitled, the place shall be
offered to the next one in order, upon payment of the aforesaid sum, so that if
the second, the third, or any other should refuse to accept the place, it may
be given to the immediate successor of him who last refused it.
Moreover, We are unwilling for those who have declined promotion in their
regular order to be excluded from their grade, but when another vacancy occurs,
We order that they shall have full power to obtain it upon the same terms which
they formerly rejected, namely, by paying the sum of money requisite to secure
the place.
8. The Same Emperors to Nomus, Master of the Offices.
We decree that those first in order in the office of the Imperial Secretaries,
as well as in that of the Count of the Inventories, whose fidelity, long-
continued industry, ability, probity, and diligence deservedly commend them to
promotion shall, when their terms of service have expired, obtain for life the
insignia of office of Count of Our Consistory, and shall continue to enjoy all
the privileges which have previously been conferred upon them; for We have
decided that persons to whom the secrets of Our government have been deservedly
committed should be adorned and decorated with the honor of the office
aforesaid.
9. The Emperor Leo to Patricius, Master of the Offices.
Those who are employed in the offices of Our Imperial Secretaries, and have
been granted a temporary leave of absence cannot, during that time, be
subjected to civil suits or criminal prosecutions, but with their wives and
children shall remain unmolested and not be liable to public taxes or
employments, and they can even claim exemption from these after their terms of
service have expired. Their houses, likewise, which they own in the provinces,
shall be free from the annoyance of lodging soldiers.
10. The Same Emperor to Hilarianus, Count, and Master of the Offices.
We direct that the number of employees in the office of the Secretary charged
with keeping records shall not exceed sixty-two; those in the department of
letters are limited to thirty; those in that of petitions to twenty-four; and
that those whose duty it is to decipher and copy old laws in the bureau of
historical documents shall never be less than four in number. Moreover, those
persons above mentioned who are employed in the Bureau of Records shall never
perform double service, nor shall they draw up duplicates, so that several
persons will not be engaged in performing the duties of one, and nothing be
left for the others to do.
11. The Emperor Zeno.
If anyone employed in the offices of the Imperial Secretaries, that is to say,
in those of the records, inventories, letters, and petitions, who has already
been appointed, should die, the substitute who occupies the vacancy as being
next in the line of promotion shall pay, by way of consolation to the heirs,
successors, children, and creditors of the decedent, the sum prescribed by the
Imperial Constitutions of the Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian, of Divine
Memory. Those who lent money to the deceased to enable him to secure the
position, even if the succession or estate should not be accepted or entered
upon, will still be entitled to preference over the others; and the children,
the agnates, and the cognates shall have the right to receive the said sum of
money, not by way of inheritance, but as a privilege, and they shall be
permitted to demand it, and bring suit for its recovery; and
Our law must not be evaded or violated by the commission of any fraudulent act,
and especially as there can be no doubt that, when the distinguished Proximiof
the Secretaries' office die without having completed their terms, they can
transmit to their heirs and successors the remainder of their salaries, without
any diminution whatsoever.
12. The Same Emperor to Celer, Master of the Offices.
We order that persons employed in the offices of the Imperial Secretaries, as
well as their parents, wives, and children, shall not be obliged to answer in
any civil or criminal proceeding, except before the tribunal of Your Highness.
Moreover, their tenants, serfs, and slaves residing in this Imperial City shall
enjoy the same privilege, and the assistants of the Proxlmus,or the ordinary
employees, shall only be compelled to be sworn; so that if anyone of them is
forced to appear in court, he Will only be required to furnish security by
oath; and if he has no real property, any slaves or serfs belonging to him will
be released, if their master becomes surety for them.
(1) We also order that the amount to be donated as sportulseshall be reduced,
and that only one solidusshall be paid to each one of the court officials
during the progress of a case; and two where it is brought before Your
Highness; and a half a solidusmust be paid to the copyists for drawing up the
papers; and if the case should be referred to an arbiter, one solidus,and no
more, shall be paid to him; and We decree that the third part of a solidusshall
be given to the officers for their services, not only for publication of
notices, but also for the report and the inventory.
We direct that the eminent Patron of the Treasury in office at the time, as
well as those officials whose duty it is to diminish litigation, shall demand
or extort nothing from them; and We order that half of the expenses which may
be incurred by the above-mentioned persons in the proceedings before Your
Highness shall only be paid by them in tribunals in the provinces, so that if
they become involved in litigation with reference to contributions of grain, or
guardianship, or curatorship, or notice not to construct a new work, and where
the case is brought before a higher tribunal, as for instance, before the
Prefect of Subsistence, or the patron of the Noble Prefecture of the City, or
of the Architects, the parties cannot be compelled to pay more by way of costs
and expenses than the amounts above prescribed with reference to proceedings
before the tribunal of Your Highness.
(2) We order all these rules to be observed, whether the parties to the action
themselves desire to conduct the case, or to have it done by their attorneys,
or even by their defenders. This will only apply when they have been notified
in writing to appear.
(3) If, however, they should be proceeded against by deposition, or in any
other way, no payment of sportulteshall be required of them, either by the
office of the illustrious assistant, or by anyone else, and they shall be
entitled to all the above-mentioned privileges, as well as of those afterwards
granted by former Emperors, not only in favor of such as are still in office
and afterwards become engaged in that serv-
ice, but also of such as have retired, or may hereafter withdraw from the
employments aforesaid, so that they, together with their wives, children,
vassals, and slaves, may reap the benefit of said privileges.
(4) And as We desire all litigants to be treated with equal justice in the
controversies brought before judicial tribunals, We decree that the benefit of
the privileges aforesaid shall also be shared by their adversaries; and for
this reason We order that those who are employed in the Bureau of Records shall
not only enjoy the privileges granted by Us in bringing, but also in defending
actions for them; and that those employees in the said Department who have
retired, and fixed their domicile in the provinces through love of
tranquillity, shall still be protected in the enjoyment of all the rights
conferred upon persons of this kind, by the law which We have recently
promulgated; and that they shall obtain all the advantages and benefits derived
from the same.
13. The Emperor Justinian to Proculus, Qusestor of the Imperial Palace.
Having ascertained that Our predecessors, the Emperors, formerly fixed the
number of deputies of Your Highness, and declared that it should not be lawful
for any larger number to assume the name or discharge the duties of the office,
and that there should only be twelve of them in the Bureau of Records, and
seven in the other two Bureaus of Imperial Letters, and Petitions, and in
consideration of the fact that afterwards the number was increased by political
intrigue, so that the routine of the office was disturbed, and business
interfered with through the swarm of employees to such an extent that there is
at present very little difference between the number of recorders and their
deputies:
(1) Hence We decree that the law fixing the number of persons employed shall be
restored, and that number reduced, but not in such a way that any of the
deputies who exceed the prescribed number shall be dismissed, but that
hereafter no one shall be appointed to the place until the number has been
decreased, and only those authorized by law remain. Any deputies who may
relinquish their office on account of promotion to a higher dignity, for
example, those who are raised to that of laterculusin the office of the
Imperial Secretary, or who obtain the second place in the other two offices,
after they have been appointed proximi,shall not be prevented from subrogating
to themselves those whom they may select for that purpose, even though the
latter may be entitled to precedence, and although the number may not yet have
been reduced to what it was originally.
(2) We think that the following rule should be established, because it is
supported by precedents, and for the reason that it is consonant with the
principles of justice, namely: that a petition should be presented to the
illustrous Qusestor, then in office, by him who has been given permission to
appoint someone in his stead, requesting his signature, and setting forth the
term of service and the rank of the person to be subrogated, as well as a full
statement of the case, that is to say, why he should be permitted to appoint
the individual whom he desires to subrogate to himself. In the appointment of
such
deputies, the time when the petition was presented should be taken into
consideration, so that the first accepted will always be preferred to one
admitted subsequently, and the date of the petition should govern the order of
appointment, which rule should also be observed with reference to almost all
offices.
14. The Same Emperor to Tatian, Master of the Offices.
We order, by this law, that when the deputies of the Quaestor of Our Imperial
Palace have been brought into court, either in civil or criminal proceedings,
the strict rule of law and justice shall be obeyed; so that if this should be
done without any written documents, the oral statement of the applicant will be
sufficient. If, however, papers should be filed in a complaint against one or
more of the deputies, all the necessary documents shall be produced, and the
deputies must comply with all the proper and legal formalities required in
proceedings of this kind.
(1) And, since it is preferable to depend upon evidence and precedents rather
than upon unsuitable customs, We decree that what is shown to have prevailed in
cases involving employees in the Bureau of Petitions, as well as those in that
of Imperial Letters, shall be observed, so far as the deputies in the Bureau of
Imperial Records are concerned, so that those who have obtained permission to
travel by virtue of a public leave of absence can remain abroad without any
diminution of their pay or emoluments; for the illustrious Proximiand
Melloproximi,or, in their absence, their deputies, are compelled to pay the
absentees whatever may be due them, either out of their own property, or out of
the balance of the taxes or contributions, even though the leave of absence may
extend beyond the Kalendsof January, and include holidays.
(2) We have established these regulations in order that no deputies can, by
political intrigue, be added to those who are at present in office, or even
after their number has been diminished, although they may have been reduced to
their ancient status.
15. The Same Emperor to Tatian, Master of the Offices.
We have already published certain rules having reference to the deputies of the
illustrious Quaestor of Our Palace concerning the business of the office, the
first of which directs that, until their number is reduced to its ancient
footing, none of them can be dismissed for the sole reason that there are more
of them than are authorized by law, except where one is promoted to the rank of
laterculusin the Bureau of Records, or to the second place in the other two
Bureaus, that is to say, those of Imperial Letters and Imperial Petitions; for
when these relinquish their offices they have permission to substitute for
themselves anyone else whom they may select, who shall be placed in the lowest
rank among the deputies, even though they may occupy a higher one among those
recommended for the place.
Again, another rule has been promulgated, at the suggestion of Proculus, of
illustrious memory, by which We ordered that those depu-
ties who, on account of some accident of fortune, as, for instance, through old
age or disease, had become unable to discharge their duties, could substitute
other deputies in their stead, which the said Proculus of illustrious memory
communicated to Us with the endorsement of the deputies themselves. But as We
have ascertained that, in violation of the present law, the number of deputies
in the Bureau of Imperial Records, as well as in the two other Imperial
Bureaus, that is to say, in those of Imperial Letters and Imperial Petitions,
deputies have been both added and removed, and that this has been done under
the pretext of a sale, in order that it may not occur hereafter, We communicate
the present law to Your Excellency, by which We order that those shall, in
accordance with an Imperial Rescript previously issued by Us, only be permitted
to substitute others in their stead where they have obtained the rank of
laterculusin the Bureau of Records, or the second place in the other two
offices, and the other law which We have promulgated on this subject shall be
abolished.
Permission shall not be granted to any of the said deputies, unless he has
obtained the promotions hereinbefore mentioned, to appoint another to take his
place under any circumstances whatever, so that, in this way, the said deputies
may be reduced to their ancient number, that is to say, twelve, in the Imperial
Bureau of Records, and seven in the other two Bureaus, namely those of Imperial
Letters and Imperial Petitions and Inquests.
This law has been established in order that no deputies may, through political
intrigue, be added to those who are in office at present, or even after their
number has been diminished, notwithstanding it may be the same that it was in
ancient times. For if We should decide to prohibit any changes, even though
they might be the result of some accidental circumstances, much more reason
exists for Our forbidding others to be introduced while the prior incumbents
were still in office.
All the remaining provisions of the former law shall remain in full force.
TITLE XX.
CONCERNING AGENTS EMPLOYED IN THE TRANSACTION OF
BUSINESS.
1. The Emperors Arcadius, Honorius, and Theodosius to Anthemius, Master of the
Offices.
No one belonging to the Association of Agents shall, hereafter, attempt to
occupy a place rendered vacant by the death of another; but he who, by length
of service and merit, can claim promotion, and is entitled to the position,
shall obtain it, and no objection shall be of any avail.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Kalendsof July, during the
Consulate of Honorius, Consul for the sixth time, and Aristenetus, 424.
2. The Emperors Ronorius and Theodosius to Helio, Master of the Offices.
No one shall, hereafter, without the authority of the Emperor, be permitted to
degrade an agent, or exclude him from the association to which he belongs. For
after he has proved his membership, he need entertain no fear of the censure of
a judge, nor any insult provoked by the humbleness of his origin.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Idesof November, during the
Consulate of Honorius, Consul for the tenth time, and Theodosius, 415.
3. The Emperor Leo to Patricius, Master of the Offices.
Confirming the register of agents made by Your Highness, We order that
hereafter the number of decenariishall not exceed forty-eight, and the number
of centenariishall not be more than two hundred, and that, in both instances,
candidates shall not be considered eligible unless they have passed through the
inferior degrees. In like manner, the number of biarchsshall be limited to two
hundred and fifty; that of the circitito three hundred, and the number of
knights to four hundred and fifty members.
This rule, which has been adopted at the suggestion of Your Highness, shall
remain forever in force, so that if any one of the decenariiwhose members We
have decreed shall be fixed at forty-eight should die, his heirs at law or
testamentary heirs will be entitled to his salary and emoluments, just as he
himself would have been if he had lived; for which reason his successor shall
not be appointed until his term of office has expired.
No one shall be entitled to enjoy the pay and privileges attaching to
membership in the Association of Agents without the sanction of the Emperor,
which must be entered on the registers in the office of the Imperial Secretary
of Records.
4. The Same Emperor to Patricius, Master of the Offices.
As, in the first place, it has been decreed that those agents who have attained
to the rank of ducenariusor centenariusshall, in this Imperial City, be subject
to the authority of no other judge, or, indeed, to the supervision of anyone
else whomsoever, except that of the distinguished Master of the Offices, to
whom is conceded the right of appointing someone to represent them in court, We
decree that this rule shall be especially applicable in criminal cases, for it
would be absurd if he who had no jurisdiction over pecuniary matters should be
obliged to render a decision affecting the life and reputation of another. We
order that this privilege shall also be granted to those who temporarily
administer the office, although We are aware that, so far as they are
concerned, an ancient custom to the contrary has been observed up to this time;
still they should entertain no doubt that if, after having relinquished the
above-mentioned office, they should not be included among the centenarii,they
will be subject to the Common Law. We forbid the enjoyment of this privilege to
all the above-
mentioned centenariiresiding in the provinces, unless they are absent in the
discharge of some public duty, and, in accordance with the ancient rule, We
also order them to comply with the decisions of the ordinary judges.
TITLE XXI.
CONCERNING THE OVERSEER OF AGENTS EMPLOYED IN THE TRANSACTION OF BUSINESS.
1. The Emperor Leo to Patricius, Master of the Offices.
We decree, by this law, which shall remain perpetually in force, that agents
employed in the transaction of business who, through length of service, have
attained the rank of overseer shall, to the number of four each year, in
regular succession, be appointed under-assistants to each of the Bureaus of
Construction and of the Barbarians, with the exception of those among them who,
either in person or by others, are engaged in any kind of trade; for the latter
are forbidden by the Imperial Constitutions to hold the office, excepting such
as have undertaken the administration and supervision of the property of
others. We desire that they shall aspire to such employments, whose efforts
have received the approbation of members of the body to which they belong.
Those also are excluded from this Imperial privilege who, while belonging to
the said Association of Agents, have become attached to the offices of the
Imperial Secretaries, presided over by the Primiceriusor Tertiocerius,and who
are employed as deputies in drawing up public documents, as they cannot work in
two places at the same time; and, in addition to the emoluments which they
obtain from the aforesaid posts of secretaries, they should be content with the
honor of
being chief.
If, indeed, they should be disabled by disease or age, or incapacitated for any
other reason whatsoever, so as to be unable to perform the duties of the
aforesaid office, We, in consideration of their former services, do hereby
order that they themselves shall, on their own responsibility, have the right
to select others to fill their places, by appointing persons who are solvent
and of good morals, and possess the requisite knowledge and skill to perform
their duties in the said offices of the Imperial Secretaries.
2. The Emperor Anastasius to Celer, Master of the Offices.
We decree by this most salutary law that agents employed in the transaction of
business shall, as in the case of officials charged with the collection of
sportulss,in the judicial duties assigned to them, be liable to the costs, the
payment of which they or their adversaries may be condemned, and that the same
rule shall apply where attorneys have been appointed by them to conduct their
cases, and they shall enjoy the benefits which have already been granted by the
Imperial Constitutions to those engaged in the service of the government; and
where a solvent
surety must be provided, he shall be a member of the same body, and they will
not be compelled to offer a stranger.
Still, all privileges that may have been granted by Imperial Constitutions to
centenarii, decenarii, chartularii,or illustrious chiefs, after they have
retired from service, and which have been enjoyed up to the present time, shall
remain intact and inviolate; as it would be extremely absurd, and even rash,
for this evidence of Our liberality to diminish, by some subtle interpretation,
the privileges already conceded, when the intention was that they should be
increased.
The same rule shall be observed with reference to the mothers and wives of
those persons, as well as to children who are under their control, so that
neither they nor their slaves may be compelled to perform any other service,
and any of the above-mentioned persons residing in the provinces shall be
entitled to the same privileges. All of them, however, shall be required to pay
their share of the sportulss,and the expenses of litigation, that is, the third
part of the sum above mentioned. Any persons who, in any way or at any time,
violate this law, or permit it to be done, shall be liable to a fine of ten
pounds of gold, and be subjected to other severe penalties.
TITLE XXII.
CONCERNING THE CHIEFS OF AGENTS EMPLOYED IN THE TRANSACTION OF BUSINESS.
1. The Emperor Zeno.
We reward agents employed in the transaction of business after they have
retired from office, with the honors of the chieftainship; and therefore those
who, without the authority of the Emperor, have been raised to this dignity,
cannot, as officials, be charged with any matters having reference to public or
private affairs; and they cannot, without the interposition of Imperial
authority, be compelled to appear in person, even where they are called upon to
do so in the place where they reside.
We desire advocates to be notified of this, lest, without the knowledge of the
Emperor, they may present some claim against a person of this kind, which
should not be done even where it has reference to matters in which others are
interested, and where fraud is said to have been committed.
In case this law is violated, We order that ten pounds of gold shall be paid by
your office to Our Treasury.
2. The Emperor Anastasius.
We order that, in all actions at law, no matter who the persons concerned may
be, even if they are of senatorial dignity, recourse shall especially be had to
the chiefs of the agents for the transaction of business, and that all other
matters which are usually submitted to the Senate shall hereafter be in charge
of the officers of the census, and
that the rights of the parties shall not be prejudiced by any rescript which
has been surreptitiously obtained.
3. The Same Emperor.
We order that the chiefs of the agents for the transaction of business shall,
among other privileges, be invested with the dignity of Proconsul.
4. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Valemtius, Master of the Offices.
The chiefs of the agents employed in the transaction of business shall be
permitted to have domestics attached to their offices on whose fidelity and
industry they think that they can rely, even if the latter have previously
discharged the same duties.
If any agent employed in the transaction of business should not have been able
to perform his duties, for the term of twenty-five years, on account of the
infirm condition of his health, and, by the vote of the entire body to which he
belongs, should attain to the dignity of chief, We order that he shall enjoy
the same privileges to which those are entitled who have obtained that honor by
continuous service for the full term required by law. In the congratulations of
judges, however, We order that the latter shall take precedence, when they can
allege that they have enjoyed official honors for a longer time than the
former. Where any of the officers of the census or their attendants are guilty
of violating the rights of those who have been appointed to chieftainship, they
shall be condemned to pay a fine of twenty pounds of gold.
5. The Same Emperor to Cyrus, Prsstorian Prefect.
We order that those agents employed in the transaction of business who have
regularly passed through the grade of decenariusto that of chief, or have been
appointed deputies of the illustrious Master of the Offices, when they are
included among those who are honored, shall obtain the title of vicegerent.
6. The Same Emperors to Nomius, Master of the Offices.
We decree that the chief of agents employed in the transaction of business, who
frequently attain the above-mentioned rank, after having been exposed to great
dangers, and sometimes to the risk of loss of life; when their time of service
has expired, shall, for the remainder of their lives, be entitled to the honor
of Count of the First Rank; remaining at the same time in the enjoyment of all
of the privileges previously conferred upon them.
7. The Emperor Leo to Nicosterius.
Anyone who, being a member of the body of cohortals, has a son born to him
during the time he is serving in the association of agents employed in the
transaction of business, before he attains to the rank of chief, and although
he himself, after his term of service has expired, just as any other freeman,
will not be subject to any of the restrictions
imposed by members among the cohortals, he will, nevertheless, leave his son
liable to them.
If, however, he should have a son born to him after he has obtained the dignity
of chief, the said son, even if he was not enrolled in the body of agents
employed in the transaction of business, will remain free and secure from any
obligation attaching to the condition of cohortal, as he was born to a father
who is free, and absolutely independent of the liabilities attaching to this
condition.
8. The Emperor Anastasius.
With a view to the interests of the numerous persons who become members of the
association of agents employed in the transaction of business, We order that
whenever the illustrious chiefs of the said association have finished their
term of service, their wives, children, slaves, or vassals who may be required
to appear in court and defend themselves in person, or by their attorneys,
shall not be compelled to pay the officers more than one solidusby way of
sportulss;and not more than a third part of a solidusshall be given to the
attendants of a vicegerent or a Governor, and that no extortions or annoyances
shall be practiced with reference to the furnishing of sureties, but such
sureties shall be provided as the defender of the district may consider to be
suitable, so that, in accordance with the tenor of the general edicts, those
who possess immovable property either in the Capital or in the provinces shall
only be bound to furnish security by oath, and such as is based upon the
property which they themselves possess. It should also be added that no summons
shall be valid unless it is reduced to writing.
In like manner, with reference to what has been provided concerning other
officials, whenever civil or criminal proceedings are instituted against them,
the executive officer having charge of the civil or criminal case from
beginning to end shall be content with the payment of a single solidusby way of
fees; and two solidishall be paid by them, or their wives, for recording
Imperial letters, or for filing a simple claim against persons presumed to be
liable; and whenever copies are demanded, those whose duty it is to give them
shall not hesitate to do so, after having demanded and received a solidus.
We order that the executive officers shall not have authority to collect more
than three solidifor furnishing documents to those who are entitled to them,
and that not more than one solidusshall be paid to an arbiter, and half a
solidusto the attorney of the Treasury, and half a solidusshall be paid to
notaries for the preparation of any papers which they may be required to draw
up from the beginning to the end of the case, as has already been stated.
Where, however, suit is brought, not before an arbiter but before a superior
judge, the said illustrious magistrate cannot collect more than four solidifor
instituting the proceedings, and for the record of the papers only two
solidishall be paid. No one shall be annoyed by the exaction of any other sums
for costs than those above mentioned; and this rule shall apply to all persons,
whether the parties bring actions against others, or whether they are sued as
defendants.
TITLE XXIII.
CONCERNING SPIES AND DETECTIVES.
1. The Emperor Constantine to Julian, Prsetorian Prefect.
Spies and detectives, or any persons whose duty it is to inform the judges of
crimes which have been committed, are required to establish their accusations,
and they will run great risk if it should be proved that they have falsely
accused anyone who is innocent, for the disgraceful practice by which they are
permitted to arbitrarily imprison persons must be abolished.
2. The Same Emperor to Taurus, Pr,astorian Prefect.
We think that agents employed in the transaction of business should be mindful
of Our orders in the care and inspection of the public post, and that this will
be in every respect to the advantage of the State; therefore, We order that
this duty shall entirely devolve upon officials of this kind and upon no
others. The said officials must use extraordinary diligence to prevent any
interference with the transport of the mails, and prevent more from being
demanded than is customary.
He who attempts to do anything of this kind shall be deprived of the profit of
his dishonorable conduct, and notice should be given of his act either .to the
judges, or the detectives, even though he may assert that We have directed
great speed to be used because of the urgency of the matter; and no persistency
nor the rank of the individual concerned will have any effect. Therefore, We
forbid any money to be demanded for an animal not set apart for the transport
of the mails. Whoever perpetrates an offence of this kind shall be compelled to
pay fourfold the amount that he received.
3. The Emperor Constantine to the Agents Employed in the Transaction of
Business.
All condemnations by prefects of those among you who have been charged with the
inspection of the post, and have honestly discharged their duty, are hereby
annulled, but the sentences of any who have acted dishonestly, or have
tarnished the honor of the service, shall not only be confirmed, and a more
severe penalty shall be inflicted, in additien.
4. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Marcellus, Master of the Offices.
We decree that agents employed in the transaction of business shall be sent, in
turn, to each province, where they should be charged not only with the
inspection of the post, but also with the transportation of public property.
They shall have nothing in common either with the judges, or the inhabitants of
the provinces, nor shall unlawful contributions be collected by them from
ships, nor shall they gratuitously receive petitions, take testimony, or decide
legal controversies, which they are not authorized to do, nor shall they commit
anyone to prison, but they must attend to postal matters exclusively.
TITLE XXIV.
CONCERNING OFFICERS OF THE PALACE ATTACHED TO THE BUREAUS OF THE IMPERIAL
LARGESSES AND PRIVATE
AFFAIRS.
1. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens.
Palatines are only liable to the payment of the poll-tax, and impositions on
land, and are released from all extraordinary and ignoble contributions,
tributes, and burdens of every description.
Given at Constantinople, on the Nonesof May, during the Consulate of
Constantius, Consul for the fourth time, and Constans, 342.
2. The Emperors Valens, Gratian, and Valentinian to Count Tatian.
No fiscal officer, or subordinate of the Count of the Treasury, who has once
been convicted of breach of trust can, under any circumstances, be reinstated,
or obtain any other dignity by intrigue or other means, or perform the
functions of any public employment whatsoever.
3. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Pan-cratius.
The former rule having been restored, a Palatine, in preference to all others,
shall be despatched to Cappadocia to act as Count of the Houses, and if he
should be guilty of dishonesty, you will be responsible, therefore you should,
every year, select a Palatine suitable for this place and send him there.
4. The Same Emperors to Hesperius, Prsetorian Prefect.
There shall be nothing in common, nor any connection between the different
judges and the officers of the palace who are despatched by the counts upon a
mission; but (with the exception of the respect which is due, and should be
shown not only by inferior officials, but also by those of exalted rank, as
well as by residents of the provinces, to the Governors of the same), the
Palatines shall not go beyond what is required of them.
5. The Same Emperors to Nebridius, Praetorian Prefect.
Certain members of the Order of Palatines, after their terms of service have
expired, have tried to obtain admission among those employed in the Bureaus of
Transportation. Hence We order, by this law, that hereafter, no one who
attempts to do this shall be heard, but each shall remain attached to the
bureau in which he chose to serve, and he shall not be transferred to another
place, even if he has already attained to the highest rank in his own order.
6. The Same Emperors to Probus, Prsetorian Prefect.
Your Excellency is hereby informed that you can exercise no authority over the
subordinates of the Palatines, and that hereafter you
will not be permitted to make any addition to them whatever. We also forbid the
Governors of the provinces to attempt anything of this kind.
7. The Same Emperors to Trifolius, Count of the Imperial Largesses.
We decree, by the present law, that all persons employed in the Bureau of the
Imperial Largesses shall be of the number hereinafter specified, so that they
may remain satisfied, and be aware that no addition can, under any
circumstances, be made to their number, even though someone may desire to
obtain admission through the benefit of a special privilege obtained from the
Emperor. We also desire to determine the amounts of the contributions of grain
to be made, dependent upon the rank of the person, and to provide that they
shall not, hereafter, be increased.
(1) The following is the list of the employees of each of the Bureaus of the
Imperial Largesses.1
8. The Same Emperors to Trifolius, Count of the Imperial Largesses.
The suggestion which you have made concerning all Palatines who should be sent
upon missions is hereby confirmed, and it is decided that every year three
ducenarii,and as many centenariias you may deem advisable, shall be despatched
as aforesaid.
9. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius.
Let no one think that he can assume any official duties, either in the Bureau
of the Imperial Largesses, or in that of Private Affairs, unless he has been
especially authorized to do so by the Emperor.
10. The Emperors Theodosius, Arcadius, and Honorius.
We order that those Palatines who, after having been employed in the Department
of Accounts in the Bureau of Imperial Largesses, and have finished their terms
of service, shall, as assistants and primiceri,of different offices, enjoy the
same privileges which We have recently bestowed upon agents employed in the
transaction of business; that is to say, they shall be exempt from the payment
of the contributions required of those entering the said Orders, and shall not
be liable to other burdens.
11. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius.
We establish the same regulation for the Bureau of the Imperial Largesses, as
well as for that of Private Affairs, which We have promulgated with reference
to the proximiof the Imperial Secretaries' office, and decree that the chief
shall remain for two years in the discharge of his duty, and that the
privileges which have already been conferred by the laws upon those offices, or
upon the primiceria,by the Imperial Constitutions, shall remain unchanged and
unimpaired.
1 This has been omitted because the translation could serve no useful purpose,
and many of the words employed are not to be found in any dictionary.ED.
12. The Emperor Theodosius.
It will not be necessary for the Palatines residing in this Imperial City to
appear in court before the illustrious Urban Prefect, unless the case involves
the erection of houses, servitudes, or the contribution of grain; and in all
other legal proceedings, pecuniary as well as criminal, they shall only be
obliged to answer before the illustrious counts. We permit the Governors of
provinces to only have jurisdiction over the civil and criminal cases of such
Palatines as are subject to their administration in civil as well as criminal
cases, where the said Palatines are not engaged in public matters, provided
that, if a criminal sentence must be pronounced against them, this shall not be
done unless the illustrious count, in whose service the defendant is engaged,
has first been notified and given his consent at the instance of the Governor
of the province.
13. The Same Emperor and the Csesar Vcdentinicm to Eudoxius, Count of the
Imperial Largesses.
Among the other prerogatives which have previously been conferred upon the body
of employees attached to the Bureau of Imperial Largesses is the one that its
Primiceriusand the three other Primiceriiof the secretaries' office shall
receive the military dignity of Prastorian Tribune; and no contribution, either
public or private, shall be imposed upon them by the authority of any judge
whatsoever.
14. The Same Emperors to Florentius, Prsetorian Prefect.
We order that the Palatines attached to the Bureau of Our Private Affairs shall
enjoy the same privileges conferred upon those who belong to the Bureau of the
Imperial Largesses. For, as the nature of the service is the same, it seems to
be only just and proper that both offices should enjoy similar privileges.
Therefore, We decree that the Primicerii,as well as the three first officers of
the Bureau of Private Affairs, after their terms of service have expired, shall
be permitted to adore the Emperor with the praetorian military tribunes, and
that they shall retain all other privileges bestowed upon them by the Imperial
Constitutions, so that they will not be subject to any tax or contribution of a
private or public character, imposed by any judge whomsoever; but shall enjoy
the dignity to which they have attained, exempt from all requirements and all
molestation.
TITLE XXV. CONCERNING STRATORS.
1. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Zosimus, Governor of New Epirus.
We have published a general edict throughout all the provinces providing that
only one soliduscan be demanded by stratorsas a fee for their services; and We
have prescribed a certain form to be observed in the offering of horses for the
public service, in order that the
people of Our provinces may know what rule must be observed. We have also made
persons liable to the Treasury for a certain number of solidi,by way of fine,
if they should venture to give to stratorswhat they are forbidden to demand.
The office of Your Excellency shall be fined a hundred pounds of gold, if,
being aware that the above offence has been committed, you do not immediately
punish it with all the severity authorized by law.1
TITLE XXXXVVII..CONCERNING CASTRENSIARII AND MINISTERIANII.
1. The Emperor Constantine.
The successors of those employees in the office of Your Excellency whose terms
have expired shall be appointed in accordance with their merits, and their time
of previous service, in compliance with the formalities prescribed by the
Imperial Rescripts, that is to say, after the lapse of two years; and
permission shall not be given those who have completed their terms of service
to be reappointed, or again to perform the same official duties.
2. The Same Emperor to Scholasticus, Castrense of the Imperial Palace.
If anyone of the Castrensiariishould be raised to the first, second, or third
class in the body to which he belongs, he shall be entered upon the registers
as the last supernumerary of the third class.
3. The Emperors Valentinian and Theodosius.
Those who are attached to the service of the Imperial Wardrobe, as well as
their mothers and wives, cannot have civil or criminal proceedings instituted
against them, unless this is done before Your Highness.
4. The Emperor Augustus.
The officials above mentioned, who are in Our Imperial service (whose functions
are-enumerated in detail in the note hereto annexed) can, under no
circumstances, be subjected to the jurisdiction of any inferior or superior
judge, but can only be brought into court by Your Highness; so that they
cannot, at any time, be sued in the tribunal of any other magistrate, and be
compelled to answer, except in that pre-
1 There were several kinds of stratoresknown to the Romans. Those above
referred to were officials assigned to collect horses for the use of the
government, or the private stud of the Emperor.
Others performed the functions of grooms or equerries, had supervision over the
imperial stables, and assisted the Emperor to mount. Officials of high rank,
also, were entitled to attendants of this description.
Others, again, acted as pioneers, moving in advance of the main body of troops,
and some were charged with the inspection of prisons. Owing to their duties,
which were more or less of a military character, stratoresof all classes were
considered to belong to the army.ED.
sided over by Your Highness. But, in order that, in this court, they may not be
subjected to enormous expense, or too readily and without good cause be called
to account by any judge whomsoever, We have deemed it advisable to fix the
amount of fees, and prescribe the number of sureties, providing, above all
things, that such persons cannot be sued without a signed or written order
issued under the direction of Your Highness.
Moreover, after having been sued, they shall not be compelled to furnish any
other surety than the agent having charge of their affairs, or one of their
principal subordinates, who will be responsible for the person of the defendant
without the execution of any bond; and they shall answer in court either in
their own proper persons, or by a regularly appointed attorney, whether a civil
action is brought against them, or they are criminally accused. Nor shall they
be obliged to pay the bailiffs, by way of fees, more than one aureus,during the
whole of the litigation. They shall not be required to give more than three
solidito those who appear for them in the case, and conduct it, whether it is
terminated in the lower court, or an appeal is taken and prosecuted, or whether
any other legal proceedings take place from the beginning to the end of the
action; and We order that those who receive these sums shall always remain
satisfied with the same. In ordinary judicial inquiries, only two solidishall
be paid for the service of notices.
(1) Again, these privileges shall not only apply to the parties themselves, but
also to their mothers and their wives, and shall remain inviolate.
We also decree, by this law, that where necessity demands, the latter shall
only be obliged to furnish their sons and their husbands as sureties; and that
the above-mentioned persons, during their term of service, as well as
afterwards, shall enjoy all the privileges and benefits granted by the
Constitution of the Emperor Martian, of Divine memory; all of which shall
remain in force, with the exception of the provision by which they were, at
that time, placed under a different jurisdiction.
(2) They shall be compelled to pay to the Advocate of the Treasury, or the
clerks who discharge their duties before arbiters, only the third part of a
solidus,from the beginning to the end of the litigation. When the case is tried
before arbiters, they shall be obliged to pay half a solidus,and where the
party resides in the provinces, and after having been sued is unable to furnish
sureties, he can only be compelled to be sworn, and no proceedings can be
instituted against him, at any time, unless in pursuance of an order of Your
Highness; except where they have reference to tribute, the performance of civil
functions, and the prosecution of crimes, which the general provisions of the
laws require to be examined and tried in the places where they have been
committed.
We decree, by the present law, that the illustrious Assistant of Your Highness
shall be charged with the duty of seeing that none of the regulations which We
have established are violated in any way.
TITLE XXVII. CONCERNING DEANS.
1. The Emperors Theodosius, Valentinian, and Arcadiiis.
Four of the body of deans, who have attained to the highest rank of their
service, shall discharge the duties of Primiceriusfor the term of two years,
and cannot remain any longer in this office; and those next in order shall,
after the expiration of two years, as aforesaid, succeed them, without either
favor or intrigue being allowed to have any effect.
2. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Nonius, Master of the Offices.
Mindful of the consideration to which the members of Our household are
entitled, We decree that deans shall not be brought into other courts in
compliance with the wishes of their adversaries, but shall only be subject to
the jurisdiction of the Masters of the Offices, for in this way the respect due
to Us will not be violated, and those who bring suit against them will be
answered in accordance with law. We order that, as in the case of agents
employed in the transaction of business, no one shall be permitted to bring the
above-mentioned persons before another tribunal, and that the defendants shall
be permitted to choose their sureties from the chiefs of their organization.
TITLE XXVIII. CONCERNING SURVEYORS.
1. The Emperor Zeno.
The Primiceriusof the surveyors shall, after two years of service, be admitted
into the body of agents for the transaction of business.
TITLE XXIX.
CONCERNING THE PRIVILEGES OP THOSE WHO ARE EMPLOYED IN THE IMPERIAL PALACE.
1. The Emperor Constantine.
We order that the Palatines, as well as those whose duty it is to render Us
their personal attendance, and the employees of the Imperial Secretaries, that
is to say, those who are attached to the Bureaus of Records, Letters, and
Petitions, shall be exempt from any appointments to offices involving ignoble
services; and We decree that their sons, grandsons, and other descendants shall
enjoy the same privileges, and, together with all their personal property and
urban slaves, shall be exempt from all base public charges; and no injury shall
be inflicted upon them by anyone whomsoever.
Anyone who violates this law, no matter what his rank may be, shall pay the
prescribed penalty.
2. The Same Emperor to Rufinus, Prsetorian Prefect.
We desire Our chamberlains, who have retired from office, as well as the
Palatines employed in different branches of the service, and the subordinates
of the Bureaus of Records, Letters, and Petitions, and also all Palatines
stationed either in the palaces of the different cities of Our Empire, or in
the camps, to enjoy the same privilege; so that neither they, nor their sons or
grandsons, shall be compelled to accept public office or discharge municipal
duties. We release them all from performing the functions of any base or
corporeal public employment, for they are worthy of Our favor to such an extent
that they shall be entitled to their castrense peculium,whether they are still
attached to the palace, or have been permitted to go into retirement.
We also concede all these privileges to agents employed in the transaction of
business, even though they may be considered to belong to the military
profession.
3. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius.
Men who have been employed in Our palace shall be exempt from all
contributions; and, although they may be persons of property, shall not be
subjected to the arrogance and rapacity of government officials.
4. The Same Emperors.
We desire all those who have held different positions in the palace to obtain
only the insignia of the one which they occupied at the time of their
discharge. All must be promoted in regular order, and shall receive the
Palatine honors, in accordance with seniority of service.
Anyone who is rash enough to violate this law shall suffer the penalty for
sacrilege.
TITLE XXX.
CONCERNING THE PRIVILEGES OF THE FAVORED DIVISIONS OP THE ARMY.
1. The Emperors Theodosius, Arcadius, and Honorius.
We deny distinguished military counts the right to scourge and degrade senators
and ducenarii,for when any acts are committed which deserve punishment of this
kind, We wish them to be brought to the attention of Your Highness.
Moreover, We decree that their domestics cannot be created senators,
ducenarii,or centenarii,and anyone who violates this Imperial Constitution
shall be fined five pounds of gold. If anything of this kind should be
attempted in the Bureau of Barbarians, or, if attempted, should not be
denounced, a fine of ten pounds of gold shall be imposed.
It has been established, not without reason, that anyone who, on account of his
rank, We have decreed shall be excluded from the office of domestic either
permanently, or for the term of five years; cannot, through the favor of the
count, and, under another name, administer the said office which he is
forbidden by law to hold.
2. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius.
We decree, by this law, that those who have served in different organizations,
and, when their terms have expired, have attained to the rank of Primicerii,and
whom after their adoration, the Emperor has raised to the illustrious dignity
of count, shall enjoy all the rights and privileges attached to the above-
mentioned rank; and, subsequently, until the end of their lives, shall only be
subject to the jurisdiction of Your Highness, and shall not be compelled to
take part in any civil litigation by the order of any other magistrate
whomsoever. We desire, however, that in criminal controversies and public
tributes, they shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Governors of
provinces, lest the public welfare may suffer, or crime increase, under the
pretext of privileges which have been granted them.
3. The Emperor Anastasius.
We order that whenever members of favored divisions of the army and their wives
(if their husbands are still living, or even when they have become widows
through their death), as well as their mothers who are widows, and their
children, if they have not been specially placed under the jurisdiction of some
other judge, together with their slaves, have been made parties to either a
civil or a criminal proceeding, and judgment has been rendered against them in
the tribunal of Your Highness, they shall not be annoyed by being required to
furnish a strange surety, but, in accordance with ancient custom, can provide
the surety from their own organization.
The following rule must also be observed, namely: in criminal cases, five other
persons selected among the thirty principal members, counting from the
Primicerius,to the thirtieth in rank, shall be appointed sureties, together
with the accountant (provided the latter is willing and does not refuse), or if
the five principal members should refuse (as above stated) a single surety
along with the accountant, to be selected from strangers, shall be given in
criminal cases alone.
Officials shall not be paid more than one solidusby the parties, as a fee,
whether they answer in person, or by an attorney.
(1) We decree that where the case is submitted to an arbiter, only one
solidusshall be paid as a fee for joining issue, and another, and no more, for
the rendering of the final award by the arbiter.
(2) If the case should be brought before your tribunal, either in the first
place, or on appeal, the parties shall only be obliged to pay three solidifor
filing the papers and reading the same, and two others for the trial of the
case and the rendition of the judgment.
(3) Whenever a case in which the members of the aforesaid organization, their
wives, or children are interested, has been sent from the tribunal of Your
Highness to that of the Governor of the province, We decree that not more than
half the ordinary costs shall be collected.
It should also be added that, where any of these persons, having obtained leave
of absence, have gone to the provinces, no actions except criminal prosecutions
and cases involving the payment of tribute shall be brought against them for
five months, within which term they must
return. When, however, after the expiration of the fifth month of their leave
of absence, proceedings are instituted against them before the tribunal of Your
Highness, they will experience no inconvenience in furnishing sureties, for We
order that recourse be had to juratory security.
(4) Moreover, We decree that when legal proceedings have been begun against
members of the said organization, or their mothers, wives, children, or slaves
(as has already been stated), verbally and without having been committed to
writing, they shall not, in accordance with the distinction above set forth, be
compelled to pay anything by way of sportulse,nor shall their mothers, wives,
children, or slaves be obliged to do so. If, however, the matter is of such a
character that, with the consent of the parties, cognizance can be taken of it
even without its being reduced to writing, the case shall be tried without the
proceedings being written; and if the above-mentioned persons should lose their
case, they will only be required to pay one solidus,by way of fees, to the
executive officer having charge of the same. Where, however, the nature of the
case demands that the proceedings be committed to writing, in this instance, it
will be necessary for the proper legal documents to be drawn up, and the rules
above stated, which prescribe the amount of fees to be paid when suits are
decided and disposed of, shall be observed.
TITLE XXXI.
CONCERNING THE CASTRENSE PECULIUM OP ALL PALATINES.
1. The Emperor Constantine.
We order that all the Palatines, upon whom Our Edicts have heretofore bestowed
certain privileges, shall hold as castrense peculiumany property which they may
have obtained through their own frugality, or by Our donations, while they
resided in the Imperial palace. For what is there that should rather be
considered castrense peculiumthan property acquired with Our knowledge, and
almost under Our eyes? Nor are persons strangers to the dust and toil of camps,
who, belonging to Our retinue, are always ready to execute Our commands, are
diligent and learned, and undergo the tediousness of journeys, and the hardship
of expeditions. Therefore, Our Palatines, who are entitled to the benefits of
the privileges of the Edict, shall retain as their individual property whatever
they may have acquired while in Our palace, either by their industry (as has
been already stated), or by Our donations.
TITLE XXXII. CONCERNING THE EQUESTRIAN DIGNITY.
1. The Emperor Justinian.
We order that the Roman knights shall be placed in the next rank after those
who are designated as most illustrious.
TITLE XXXIII.
CONCERNING THE DIGNITY OF PERFECTISSIMATUS.
1. The Emperor Justinian.
Those who have obtained patents conferring the distinction of
perfectissimatusshall not be entitled to the same unless they have been
liberated from the servile condition, are not indebted to the Treasury, oorrthe
curia,,do not belong to the guild of bakers, or any other body of this kind,
have not purchased the honor with money, or managed the business of any private
individual.
TITLE XXXIV.
WHO CAN SERVE IN THE ARMY AND WHO CANNOT, AND CONCERNING SLAVES WHO ASPIRE TO
ENTER THE MILITARY SERVICE OR BE RAISED TO ANY DIGNITY. No ONE CAN HAVE Two
EMPLOYMENTS, OR HOLD Two DIGNITIES
AT ONCE.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus.
If you desire to enlist in the army, apply to those who have the right to
accept you. Moreover, you should not be ignorant of the fact that those who
enlist in the army for the purpose of avoiding litigation can be discharged
upon the demand of their adversaries.
2. The Emperor Alexander.
It has been established that enlistment in the army, even by the sons of
decurions, in order to fraudulently evade municipal duties to which they are
liable, will be of no avail.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian.
Your Highness should use the greatest diligence to prevent serfs and foresters
from being enrolled in the army, whether they are volunteers, or are compelled
to do so against their will.
4. The Emperor Leo.
No one of the condition of decurion, or cohortal, shall hereafter be permitted
to enlist in the army.
5. The Emperor Justinian.
Those persons who, up to this time, have been invested with two, three, or more
dignities, which, according to former custom, are not compatible, but separate
and distinct, shall be given the choice to retain whichever one they prefer,
and reject the others; so that they may permanently hold the one which they
have chosen, and may, undoubtedly, be excluded from those which they have
rejected.
Moreover, no one shall, hereafter, have the right to belong to more than one
order at the same time; and all persons are forbidden (as
has previously been stated) to have two or more employments, or to add another
dignity to which one he may already possess; and those who think that they can
petition for something which has been prohibited by Us shall be sentenced to
pay ten pounds of gold as a fine for their presumption, even though they may
have derived no benefit from it; and all who surreptitiously obtain authority
from the Emperor for this purpose (which sometimes happens) shall be fined ten
pounds of gold.
When the officials attached to the different bureaus having charge of matters
of this kind do not resist such applications, and violate the law, they shall
be punished with a fine of ten pounds of gold. If this law should be
disregarded in any respect, all persons are hereby notified that whatever has
been illegally permitted, done, or inscribed upon the public records, shall be
considered as not having been obtained or decreed in any way, or entered upon
any register.
All persons who have obtained promotion in the military service, as well as in
the civil administration in the provinces, whether they are employed at present
or may be employed hereafter, are also notified that their rank, when
authorized by the Emperor, shall be retained by them, and that, after their
terms of service have expired, they will have permission to choose between the
two dignities which they have received (whichever one they may prefer), so that
they can decide whether they will keep their former dignity and renounce the
one subsequently bestowed, or vice versa.
We, however, through Our inclination to be indulgent, have determined that all
shall be free to adopt the above course, if the post which is to be
relinquished is included among those that can be sold and transferred to
others, and the price paid for the same is received; hence this can now be
done, as was previously the practice in the army. Those, however, are excepted,
and are not required to obey this Imperial law (which shall prevail for all
time) who have two similar employments, as in the case of the members of the
favored divisions of the army, whom it is customary to appoint as candidates,
as well as the laterculiiand the pragmaticarii,and private secretaries who
enjoy the distinction of being attached to the Bureau of the Imperial Records,
and the agents engaged in the transaction of business, who are invested at the
same time with several dignities which have a common resemblance.
6. The Emperor Justinian.
With reference to slaves who, either with or without the knowledge of their
master, may hereafter aspire to any office, We order that in case the latter
was ignorant of the fact, he can appear before a competent judge, and prove
that his slave was prompted without his knowledge (and this will be sufficient
where the contrary cannot be proved), and if he does so, the slave shall, in
consequence, be removed from office, and again brought under the control of his
master.
Where, however, the slave obtained promotion with the knowledge of his master,
the latter shall not only forfeit his right of ownership to him, but also his
right of patronage, and the slave will become free;
and if he proves to be useful in the service in which he is employed, he shall
continue in it, but if he should not be fit, he shall be dismissed. So far as
these slaves, who are at present engaged in such employments, and who have
already served a considerable time, are concerned, We grant permission to their
masters, within the term of thirty days (to be reckoned from the promulgation
of the present law) to either appear before Us, or before judges having
jurisdiction, and prove that their slaves were promoted to office without their
knowledge, and recover their ownership of them. When, however, the said term
has expired, they shall be deprived of all rights of ownership and patronage.
7. The Same Emperor.
Where any master permits his slave to be raised to any honor, for instance,
where he consents for him to enter the army, he shall be deprived of the
ownership of the slave and of the rights to which patrons are entitled. For how
can it be tolerated that men who have received donations at Our hands should
still be considered in bondage, and, perhaps, along with their masters, be
admitted to the presence of the Emperor? Therefore, under such circumstances,
where not military service, but some other honor has been acquired by slaves,
with the consent of their masters, the same rule as previously established
shall be observed, in order that Our laws may not be considered to contain
imperfections.
Again, masters are notified that, as in the case of the previous constitution
which treats of slaves of this description, unless they proceed within thirty
days from the time when they were notified, appear before a judge having
jurisdiction, and take measures to deprive slaves of their dignities, they
shall lose their ownership of said slaves, and their right of patronage over
them. After the said slaves have become free and are included among freeborn
persons, We will decide whether they shall retain the dignities to which they
have attained, or whether they shall be deprived of them as being unworthy.
TITLE XXXV. MERCHANTS SHOULD NOT SERVE IN THE ARMY.
1. The Emperor Justinian.
We forbid those engaged in trade, either in this city or in the provinces, with
the exception of bankers who are established in this capital, to serve in the
army hereafter. We order them not to enlist, as they are useful in all
contracts, but We authorize them to accept any other employment, without fear
of violating the present law.
When, however, any merchants whom We have forbidden to enter the military
service have already enlisted, We grant them permission to abandon their
occupations and retain their rank in the army, being Well aware that if they
afterwards engage in any mercantile transactions, they will be dismissed from
the service. We wish any bankers
of this city, who have already enlisted, to remain in the army, as they should
be permitted to do so if they abandon their business.
Therefore, after the promulgation of this law, all merchants shall be
discharged from military service with the exception of those engaged in the
fabrication of arms, who shall not be prohibited from pursuing their
occupation, and shall still retain authority to transact business of this kind.
TITLE XXXVI.
CONCERNING MILITARY AFFAIRS.
1. The Emperor Antoninus.
You cannot, under the right of postliminium,legally demand your pay and your
donations for the time during which you allege you were a captive in the hands
of the enemy.
2. The Same Emperor.
If you have served for twenty years in the army, no degrading services can be
imposed upon you.
3. The Emperor Augustus.
Soldiers who have been dishonorably discharged from the service are branded
with infamy, and are not entitled to any honors which are ordinarily conferred
upon men of good reputation. They shall, however, have the right to reside
wherever they please, with the exception of places from which they are
expressly excluded.
4. The Emperor Alexander.
My father, the Divine Marcus Antoninus, decreed that the property of deceased
deserters should be confiscated.
5. The Emperor Gordian.
As you state that your sister's husband, after having been a deserter for seven
years, was pardoned by Us, you have no right to ask that he should be
considered as having been in the military service during that time. Hence, as
We have pardoned him, he will be held to have served in the army, except while
he was a deserter, and therefore he cannot collect his pay during the period of
his desertion.
6. The Same Emperor.
When soldiers have been discharged on account of illness, it is not customary
for them to be reinstated under the pretext that their health has been restored
when they were not hastily dismissed, unless it is shown by the report of
physicians, and after examination by a competent magistrate, that they have
contracted some disease.
7. The Same Emperors.
You have no ground for apprehension that your reputation as a veteran will be
injured because you have been guilty of some violation
of military law, especially as it has been decided that soldiers, after having
been honorably discharged, cannot be branded with infamy for offences
previously committed, even where these could be perpetrated by persons in civil
life.
8. The Emperor Philip.
A soldier who has been discharged because of illness will suffer no loss of
reputation.
9. The Emperor Constantine and the Caesar.
Where anyone, with malicious intent, affords an opportunity for barbarians to
commit depredations against the Roman people, or if he should share the booty
obtained by them in some other way, he shall be burned alive.
10. The Same Emperor.
Soldiers, who have been authorized by Us to have their families join them,
shall only include their wives, children, and the slaves purchased with their
peculium castrense,but not those registered in the Bureau of the Census, and
Your Excellency shall see that this rule is complied with.
11. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius.
Neither tribunes, nor common soldiers, shall have the right to wander about,
but shall remain with their standards in the barracks and other places allotted
to them. If anyone should violate this law, which has been promulgated as
necessary, a report shall immediately be made to Us with reference to the said
soldiers or tribunes, by the Governor or the defender of the district, in order
that the severest penalty may be inflicted upon them.
12. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius.
As all the legions are encamped on the banks of the river, We, by way of
precaution, decree that no one shall defile the waters of the stream, which are
used for drinking purposes, by depositing any filth therein, and that no one
shall violate public decency by washing horses while naked, but this shall be
done in a lower part of the river, far from the sight of anyone.
13. The Same Emperors.
No soldier belonging to the Imperial bodyguard, at present stationed in this
Capital, whether he is attached to a legion or to some other branch of the
service, shall dare to engage in any other occupation, either in his own
behalf, or for the benefit of someone else, without the consent of his
commander; and whoever is convicted of an offence of this kind shall be
discharged from the army and compelled to suffer the usual penalties. Those who
are proved to have employed a soldier in any private undertaking shall be fined
five pounds of gold. Where anyone, having been sent by his company, or by the
tribune (for We
forbid this to be done under other circumstances) comes to Our Court, he must
immediately present himself before the illustrious Counts having jurisdiction
of such matters, and explain the cause of his journey, in order that he may
receive a favorable answer, and speedily obtain permission to return. When the
Governors of provinces ascertain that soldiers, having left their commands, are
wandering about the country, they must cause them to be arrested and placed in
custody until We can be notified and determine what should be done under the
circumstances.
14. The Same Emperors.
We are unwilling for Our soldiers to be transferred from one corps to another.
Therefore the counts and dukes to whom the duty of controlling the soldiers is
entrusted are notified that not only are soldiers not allowed to be transferred
from the corps appointed for the service of the Emperor or the palace to
others, but that they, themselves, have no authority to permit soldiers
belonging to the legions of the Emperor, or stationed in camps established on
the frontiers, to be transferred to the command of either of them, unless the
Emperor orders this to be done for reasons connected with the public welfare;
because every soldier should have an opportunity to increase his reputation,
not through intrigue, but by experiencing the hardships of the service.
If anyone should violate this law, he is hereby warned that a pound of gold
will be exacted by way of fine for every soldier transferred in this manner.
15. The Emperor Leo to Aspar, General of the Army.
Soldiers who are armed and supported by the State ought to devote themselves to
the public welfare alone, and not engage in the cultivation of the soil, the
care of animals, or the pursuit of commerce, but should apply themselves
exclusively to the performance of their military duties; and Your Highness must
not hereafter permit them to concern themselves with any of the above-mentioned
occupations, but order them to be constantly with the company to which they
belong, so that they may be prepared for war by the daily exercise of arms.
If any military judge should, contrary to Our prohibition, cause a soldier to
be employed on any private estate, or in any private houses, or in any other
similar services, he is hereby notified that a fine of one pound of gold for
every soldier so employed will immediately be imposed by way of fine upon him
who violated this law, as well as upon the person who profited by the labor.
16. The Same Emperor to Dioscoms.
We forbid military men to perform civil duties, and if they should undertake
anything of this kind, We decree that they shall at once be immediately
dismissed from the army, and deprived of all privileges.
This law will render Our authority formidable to anyone who may rashly attempt
to violate its salutary provisions.
17. The Emperor Zeno.
We do not permit anyone hereafter to enlist in a corps of cavalry or infantry
on the frontier without first obtaining Our consent. By an ancient custom,
which has prevailed up to the present time, permission was granted to
magistrates or officers to examine those who desired to enlist, so that those
only might serve on the frontiers who had been accepted by the Emperor. The
distinguished generals of the army, as well as the other commanders, thought,
however, that it was necessary to supply the places of those who were killed,
and having made a careful investigation, We have resolved, at their suggestion,
to determine what and how many soldiers shall be enlisted in each corps, and on
each boundary, so that, finally, We have come to the conclusion that this snail
be decided by casting lots.
It is part of the duty of the office of Your Highness to impose a fine of a
hundred pounds of gold if this law, which We have promulgated, should, in any
respect, be violated.
18. The Emperor Anastasius to John, General of the Army.
For the purpose of controlling the collectors of taxes and the inhabitants of
the provinces, as well as soldiers, without subjecting them to any injury or
expense, as far as this can be done, We have decided that it is necessary for
all soldiers who are at present serving in the East to obey the orders of their
illustrious commanders, so that when anything involving the common safety
arises and must be attended to, the proper remedy may be applied by the
military garrison stationed in the neighborhood; in other words, both civil and
criminal cases which affect the soldiers aforesaid shall not be brought for
hearing before the magistrate of highest authority in the East, but shall be
determined by the tribunal of Your Highness, under whose jurisdiction they are,
or by that of their own commanders.
(1) While it has been the custom, up to this time, for the opinions of Your
Highness to be referred to the above-mentioned magistracy, established in the
East, they must now be submitted to the illustrious commanders whom the civil
magistrates and their assistants are required to recognize as judges, and whose
orders they must be careful to obey. Permission shall not be refused to such a
magistrate, or to his successor, to render a decision in cases where Your
Highness cannot interpose your authority according to the rule which We have
promulgated, and which properly come under the jurisdiction of the general-in-
chief.
We also grant permission to the official who formerly had sole cognizance of
these matters not only to have them investigated by his assistants, but to
encourage the latter to aid one another, so that the examination of public and
private causes, and even executions, shall not take place in their absence.
We do not consider it necessary to appoint attendants for each of these
commanders, for fear that such a large number of individuals may cause some
injury to Our soldiers.
(2) But in order that the public welfare, as well as that of our brave
soldiers, may, in every respect be provided for, We think that the amount of
sportulseshould be reduced, and We order that the magistrates themselves shall
not, either in criminal or civil cases, even if they are the result of public
prosecutions, be permitted to exact more than one solidusfrom each individual,
whether the soldiers are unwilling to pay, or voluntarily make the tender, so
that if the entire corps or all the leaders are involved, only a double amount
of fees shall be paid; for in instances of this kind We do not permit more than
two of the principal defendants who have been mentioned at the institution of
the proceedings to be sued, which is provided by the laws, when a syndic is
nominated, as is customary.
(3) This provision having been added, the soldiers, or their syndics, as well
as all those who incur expense by coming into court, cannot be forced to pay
more than one solidus,which should be employed to compensate the magistrates
and their assistants; and the latter shall not be permitted to exact any more,
either personally or through the pious men who comply with the Ducian judgment
or cause it to be obeyed; so that so far as the expenses of litigation are
concerned, the same rule may be observed with reference to those who desire to
bring actions against soldiers.
(4) It will depend upon the judgment and wisdom of the illustrious generals,
according to the nature of the matter in dispute, or the amount which is
demanded by their adversaries from the soldiers, whether the case shall be
referred to the military commanders themselves, or to the judges invested with
jurisdiction in the same district.
(5) These commanders shall have supervision over the magistrates and their
assistants, and shall see that the decurions, or collectors of taxes, do not
cause soldiers who are under the orders of their commanders any expense, so
that the said commanders can, in time of peace, review and call the troops
together whenever they desire to do so.
(6) If, however, it should become necessary for the soldiers to go elsewhere,
they must, by all means, abstain from committing any wrong against the
decurions, or the collectors of taxes; and if, in going and coming, only thirty
days should be required, they can compel their expenses to be paid (without,
however, subjecting the collectors or decurions to annoyance), but if they
should be forced to remain longer in strange places, the expense incurred
during the thirty days, as aforesaid, shall be paid after they have arrived at
their destination.
(7) But as We have ascertained that certain persons have been so rash and
unjust as to bring some of the soldiers above mentioned not only before the
tribunal of Your Highness, but also before that of the eminent magistrate who
presides in the East,, for the purpose of accusing them at the same time before
both tribunals, and obtaining different judgments against the same persons for
the same causes, in order that, hereafter, such snares may not be laid for Our
soldiers, and to prevent confusion from arising in complaints brought against
them, no one shall be permitted to accuse any soldier, or soldiers, before
the tribunal of Your Highness, and prosecute him, or them, either civilly or
criminally, even though he may have obtained an order of the judges, or of the
commanders, when the former have any matter before you which has not yet been
decided.
(8) On the other hand, it should be observed that, when any soldier, or
soldiers, attached to the service of the Emperor, are accused by order of the
distinguished commander-in-chief, and reprimanded, permission shall be refused
the prosecutor to accuse, or bring the same soldier, or soldiers, before the
tribunal of Your Highness, and he shall not be permitted to do so, even if he
can prove that the said soldier, or soldiers, have committed a criminal
offence, or are civilly liable; and the complaints having been separated, Your
Highness must decide the criminal cases, and the military commander, the civil
ones, or vice
versa.
(9) Where any such soldier has committed an offence audaciously, as well as in
violation of justice, he shall be punished in pecuniary cases by the loss of
the suit, and shall have judgment rendered against him for damages on account
of the act for which he was responsible; and, in criminal cases, he shall
suffer the penalty of the law for malicious prosecution.
(10) We intend that the laws previously enacted shall be applicable to the
preservation of public security and the protection of different places, and not
employed for the purpose of diminishing the power of the magistrate invested
with the administration of justice in the East, as there is no doubt that the
military commanders themselves, whom the soldiers are obliged to obey, are
subject to the supreme authority of this official.
TITLE XXXVII.
CONCERNING THE CASTRENSE PECULIUM OF SOLDIERS AND THE SUBORDINATES OF THE
PREFECTS.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Priscianus.
If your son was under your control at the time when he purchased property in
his own name, there is no doubt that it belongs to you. Movable property,
however, which is given to a son by his father, or his mother, or any other
relatives or friends, on his departure to the army, is included in his peculium
castrense,to which also belongs any inherited personal effects which he could
not receive except as a soldier; and even immovable property is placed in this
category. The estate of a mother, however, even when it passes while her son is
in the army, is not embraced in his peculium castrense.Land which is donated is
also not included, but that which has been purchased with money taken from the
castrense peculiumconstitutes part of the latter.
2. The Same Emperor to Felix.
The son of a family cannot alienate any property without the consent of his
father, unless he has a castrense peculium.
3. The Same Emperor to Felicianus.
He who informed you that the bond of paternal authority is abolished by the
military oath, is mistaken, for soldiers still remain under the control of
their fathers, but their peculium castrenseis their own, and their fathers have
no right to it.
4. The Emperor Gordian.
Asyou state that you have been appointed heir by your brother, who is serving
with you in the same camp, it is reasonable that the estate should rather be
included in your castrense peculiumthan that it should belong to your father,
under whose control you are; for it is certainly probable that association with
your comrade-in-arms in the toils and privations of foreign military service,
and your participation in the same rewards, has increased fraternal affection,
and rendered you dearer to one another.
5. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian.
We understand that the peculiumof a son who died while in the army belongs to
his father, even though the latter may not have acquired his estate.
6. The Emperor Constantine.
It is well known that the Imperial Secretaries, the Recorders, and all others
employed in the offices of Your Highness, can claim the right of castrense
peculium,just as if they were enrolled in the First Legion of Our Empire, and
We decree that this right shall remain inviolate.
TITLE XXXVIII.
CONCERNING THE DISTRIBUTION OP MILITARY SUBSISTENCE.
1. The Emperors Constantine and Julian.
A custom which has recently been revived provides that during the time of an
expedition Our soldiers usually have not only biscuit and bread, wine and
vinegar, but also pork and mutton, issued to them; so that they receive biscuit
every other day, bread every third day, wine on one day and vinegar on another,
pork every day, and mutton every two days.
2. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens.
We order that soldiers shall not bring straw for themselves beyond the
twentieth milestone.
3. The Same Emperors to Victor, General of the Army.
Neither soldiers nor their commanders shall, under any circumstances, dare to
take anything from the inhabitants of the provinces by way of subsistence; for
all soldiers are notified that the advantages which they derive by having
rations issued to them should cause no loss to residents of the provinces.
4. The Same Emperors.
We order by a salutary provision that, on all frontiers, the purveyors
appointed by the inhabitants of the adjacent provinces shall transport
provisions to cantonments from places in the neighborhood, so that the soldiers
stationed in the veteran camps may thus obtain two-thirds of their supplies,
and not be compelled to transport more than the third part of the same.
5. The Emperors Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian to Probus, Prse-torian
Prefect.
Commissaries must, before the expiration of thirty days, punctually render
their true accounts, and they shall be compelled to make restitution from their
own property for any supplies which they may have misappropriated, or failed to
deliver to their corps, and for which they are responsible, either to the
soldiers themselves, or to the warehouses belonging to the government.
6. The Same Emperors to Modestus, Prsetorian Prefect.
Our brave and devoted soldiers shall receive their rations from the public
stores and their pay, every day, or at the proper time, that is to say, before
the expiration of a year; and if they wish to defer the receipt of what they
are entitled to, and do not apply for it within the term designated by law, it
shall be claimed by the Treasury for Our benefit.
7. The Emperors Theodosius, Arcadius, and Honorius.
No soldier shall be permitted to demand the price of supplies sent into the
provinces during a time of scarcity, which he rejected in time of plenty, so
that where anyone neglects to claim them on account of the abundance of the
crops, during the year, and afterwards, what was rejected should be valued at a
high price because of the dearth, he cannot, without violating this law, either
demand, or obtain what he once declined to accept.
8. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Hilarius, Prsetorian Prefect.
It is proper that We should go to the relief of the inhabitants of the
provinces, and therefore, Your Highness will communicate to the tribunes of all
reserves, divisions, or corps, and to the illustrious commanders of the same,
that they must remember to furnish hay to the soldiers in proper quantities, in
accordance with the law of the Divine Valentinian, without their being required
to convey it into the towns.
9. The Same Emperors.
Your Excellency will see that contractors enter upon the registers the nature
and amount of the supplies distributed, so that it may clearly appear upon what
day they were furnished to each company. And if it should be ascertained that
the commissaries, or their subordinates, have received more than was recorded
in the office of Our
Secretary, they shall be compelled to restore twofold the amount, which shall
be given to the contractors as soon as they themselves demand it, for numerous
applications have been made to the generals of both branches of the military
service, asking that We decree, by a law, that, before the beginning of the
indiction, schedules shall be faithfully and truly drawn up, and filed in the
office of Our Secretaries, in accordance with which distribution may be made by
the contractors.
10. The Same Emperors to Eutychianus, Pr&torian Prefect.
We order that, in all the provinces, from the month of November, new wine shall
be distributed to the soldiers, as old wine is considered to be too expensive.
11. The Same Emperors.
Commissaries, that is to say officials employed in the distribution of rations
to the soldiers, shall not engage in trade of any kind with the people of the
provinces, so that everything which is due can be demanded by the military
commanders, or the officials appointed by the provinces, and be paid within the
term of a year.
12. The Same Emperors and Theodosius to Anthemius, Prsetorian Prefect.
For the seven days during which the praetorian tribunes are authorized to
obtain'provisions at a low price, for their own benefit, they cannot purchase
any other kind of property for less than it is sold in the market.
13. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to 'Anthemius, Prsetorian Prefect.
We decree, by this second law, that when any soldier attempts again to claim
supplies which have already been furnished, or dares to change the rates which
have been established, if he is a general, he shall be fined a hundred pounds
of gold, and his subordinate officers shall be condemned to pay an equal sum,
in addition to the penalty for sacrilege which is imposed upon all those who
openly violate the Imperial Decrees.
14. The Same Emperors to the General Constantine.
It is necessary for paymasters to give, without delay, to those officials whom,
on account of their services, We have assigned to the command of regiments, as
many solidifrom the Treasury of Subsistence as there are commissaries, and they
shall render an account of their administration of the provender issued for
horses, when this is required by the soldiers, so that if any of them should
die before receiving what he was entitled to for any reason whatsoever, payment
may be made to his heirs.
15. The Same Emperors to Asclepiodotus, Prsetorian Prefect.
We order that all supplies that are ordinarily issued to the officers and
attendants of the Imperial palace, as well as to the staff of the
offices of the secretaries and all other bureaus, and which those who are
commissioned to collect them, actuated by cupidity and license, are accustomed
to exact with severity from the inhabitants of the provinces, shall be
estimated in the same way as the supplies issued to the soldiers from the
Department of Subsistence; and that Your Highness cause the distribution of the
same to be made to all the persons above designated, conformably to the amount
demanded by the public welfare.
16. The Emperor Anastasius to Longinus, General of Cavalry and Infantry.
We decree, by this Imperial Constitution, that those to whom, by order of the
office of Your Highness, the distribution of rewards, or the bestowal of any
other benefits upon soldiers is entrusted, shall, in the first place, swear to
discharge the duties imposed upon them in accordance with justice, and that, in
compliance with the provisions of this Our most salutary law (as has been
previously stated), the paymaster must disburse with his own hands, and without
any deceit or fraud on his part, the pay to which each soldier is entitled; so
that he can, consistently with the principles of equity, transact with a
commissary such business as is usually despatched under such circumstances.
After having done this, the commissary shall be permitted, either immediately
or after the lapse of one or two yearswhere the sum due to the soldier has
been paidto collect not more than the third part of a solidusfor everyone
disbursed, as no commissary will be allowed to contract to receive more than a
third of a solidusfor any period or term of years, nor shall he be permitted to
exceed this amount, no matter how long a time may have elapsed.
(1) When, however, any controversy arises between a commissary and a soldier
with reference to the agreement or transaction entered into at the time of
payment, We order that the sums of money which are due to the soldier from the
Imperial paymaster shall, according to the custom observed up to this time,
remain either in the hands of the latter or in those of the commissary until
the case has been heard, and the dispute between the commissary and the soldier
settled by a written decision, so that the soldier cannot, in any way or under
any circumstances, suffer loss, except where it is proved that he is indebted
under a just and legal contract made with the commissary.
(2) We desire that the following rule shall be observed with reference to those
who are away under leave of absence, namely: that the money which, according to
the provisions of the Imperial constitutions, is payable to soldiers to the
number of thirtythis number only being entitled to furlough at onceshall be
deposited with their commanders, provided they are included among those who, at
the time of payment, were registered by the commissary as having obtained leave
of absence, and are not more than thirty in number, as aforesaid; so that when
the said soldiers return, they may be entitled to indemnity, after having
stated the reason for their absence to their commander. Per-
mission should not be granted to the tribune to send away more than thirty
soldiers at one time under the pretext of a furlough.
(3) If, by the violation of Our most salutary Constitution, a tribune should
venture to dismiss more than thirty soldiers on furlough, the money payable to
those over and above the said number of thirty should undoubtedly be entered by
the paymasters upon the public registers.
(4) The tribune, moreover, is hereby notified that, in addition to the
penalties already prescribed for an offence of this kind, he will be compelled
to pay out of his own property to each of the soldiers exceeding the number of
thirty, not only what they are entitled to from the government, but also any
sums which they may have lost on account of their unjust mission, and the said
tribune cannot relinquish his command until he has indemnified the said
soldiers, and repaired all the injury which he inflicted upon them, that is to
say, upon those above the number of thirty to whom he granted leave of absence.
(5) It should be added, with reference to the evidence to be submitted, that
ten of the principal commanders, as well as the other officers, having been
sworn, must each state that payment was made in his presence and under his own
eyes, and that every soldier received from the right hand of the paymaster the
sum to which he was entitled. These facts, having been established and reduced
to writing, shall be sent to Us by the tribune, or by the commanders, within
three months from the time when this took place.
(6) Care should especially be taken that the paymaster should have no doubt, at
the time, that, after the money had been paid to him out of the public
Treasury, he must perform his duties within the space of from two to four
months, in accordance with the rule which has been established; and when, by
delaying payment, he dares to retain the public money in his possession for a
longer period, he is notified that he will be liable, under all circumstances,
to indemnify the soldiers out of his own property for any loss which the latter
may have sustained through this transaction.
All those who violate the above-mentioned law, either by deferring payment for
a longer time than was prescribed, or in any other respect, are warned that
they will not only lose their rank, but also will be liable to the confiscation
of their pay; and if they are subjected by Your Highness to a fine exceeding
the amount of their pay for the violation of the Imperial Constitution, the
surplus shall be distributed among the other soldiers.
(7) When, however, the same official, at the same time, commits an offence, the
guilty party should be sent before Us, or at all events before the supreme
magistrate, as an offence of this kind cannot come within the jurisdiction of
him who takes the place of the latter. Where the crime of one who has dared to
violate the provisions of Our most salutary Constitution, or any of the
Imperial ordinances, has been detected and perfectly established, the guilty
party can, under no circumstances, escape the penalties provided; so that all
soldiers who have been injured by the violation of the terms of the above-
mentioned constitutions shall be permitted to appear before Us by one or two of
their
number, commissioned to represent them all; and, after having filed their
complaints, and proved what they have suffered as the result of the violation
of Our Constitution, he who has been guilty of doing so shall suffer the
punishment prescribed in such cases.
(8) Moreover, We decree that, under all circumstances, the paymaster shall have
no hesitation in paying the wives or children of deceased soldiers the sums to
which, in accordance with an Imperial Constitution already promulgated, they
are entitled from the date of the death of the former.
17. The Emperor Justinian.
As it often happens that, for good and imperative reasons, soldiers are
detailed as guards, or for some other duty of this description, and it is not
proper for the public to be subjected to any loss or expense, We decree that
where any soldiers, no matter to what corps they may belong, have been, or may
hereafter be appointed by Us as guards for some decurionate, or church, or for
certain persons (as previously stated), or for any other purpose, and in order
that no injury may be sustained by the public being compelled to furnish them
subsistence, or pay, We order that the expenses incurred by them shall, by all
means, be paid out of the property of the person or persons whom they have
been, or may hereafter be appointed to protect, and that the Public Treasury
shall only be liable for subsistence or pay in the places from which the
soldiers aforesaid have already or may hereafter come; or, if the persons above
mentioned should refuse to provide for them, the said soldiers shall not leave
the places where they are stationed, or if they have done so, they must return
without delay.
The following rule shall be implicitly observed, namely, that no soldier shall
be detailed to protect anyone whomsoever, without the special written order of
the Emperor, and it shall be the duty of Your Highness, whenever an order of
this kind is issued by Us with reference to the appointment of any soldiers as
guards, to have the fact registered, as well as what should be given to them by
the persons whom they are appointed to guard, and also to cause this to be
published; and if the public should be subjected to any expense on this
account, you will be obliged to pay the amount out of your own property, as
well as a fine of thirty pounds of gold, as a penalty for your negligence, or
even for your connivance. The Governors of provinces and their subordinate
officers will be liable to the same punishment if they either violate Our
ordinances, or permit them to be violated.
18 and19. These Laws are not Authentic.
TITLE XXXIX.
CONCERNING THE COOKING AND THE TRANSPORT OF PROVISIONS FOR THE ARMY.
1. The Emperor Arcadius to the General of the Army.Commissaries who have charge
of provisions in the different provinces shall not compel persons with families
to bake bread for the
army, contrary to established custom. Therefore Your Excellency must visit with
proper punishment any usurpation of power of this kind, and when such officials
are sent into the provinces the ancient custom must be observed.
2. The Same Emperor.
No one shall be exempt from the requirement of baking biscuit for our brave
soldiers, or from the transport of supplies, and even Our household shall not
be excused from duties of this kind. If anyone should fail to obey what is
ordered, which We do not think will be the case, he shall be punished with the
greatest severity in the person of his agent, so that if it should be proved
that the principal was aware of his refusalafter he is known to have been in
defaulthe shall be compelled to pay fourfold the amount allotted to him as his
share of the general contribution.
TITLE XL. CONCERNING THE CLOTHING OF SOLDIERS.
1. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius.
We order that all distributions of clothing shall be made by the Treasury of
Our Largesses between the Kalendsof September and the Kalendsof April, and if
this is not done, the Governor of the province, or he who represents him, shall
suffer the penalty which your sense of justice may prescribe.
2. The Emperors Valentinian, Arcadius, and Honorius.
The Provinces of Thrace must furnish clothing for twenty soldiers, Scythia and
Mysia shall furnish clothing for thirty, every year; Egypt, and a part of the
East, shall each provide clothing for three hundred, and Asia and Pontus shall
furnish the same quantity annually; but, throughout the provinces of the East,
money can be paid instead of providing clothing. Among these, however, the
provinces of Osroena and Isauria are excepted; for it is settled that they
shall, by no means, be required to pay money instead of furnishing clothing.
3. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius.
We decree that for each military cloak, not two-thirds of an as,but a
solidus,shall be paid to our brave soldiers of Illyria.
4. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius.
Sums representing the estimated value of military clothing shall be collected
from contractors to be paid into Our Treasury of Largesses, so that five-sixths
of the same may be paid in silver to the soldiers, and the remaining sixth paid
by Our employees, without any inconvenience to themselves or to the public.
When it is proved that they especially desire it, the contributions shall be
made in kind to those of inferior rank.
TITLE XLI.
CONCERNING FURRIERS AND QUARTERMASTERS.
1. The Emperors Theodosius, Arcadius, and Honorius.
If any of Our quartermasters should remove the marks from houses destined for
lodgings, or the names of those who are to be entertained there, he shall be
liable to prosecution for forgery under the terms of this Constitution.
2. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius.
For the purpose of preventing any injustice being committed by quartermasters
or hosts in whatever city We ourselves may be, or in whatever place Our
soldiers may be encamped, We desire that the owner shall undisturbed and secure
retain two-thirds of his house, and that the other third shall be devoted to
the reception of guests, so that, the building having been divided into three
parts, the owner may have the privilege of choosing the first, and the guest
select the one which he wishes, but the remaining one shall be relinquished to
the owner; for it is entirely consonant with equity and justice that he who has
become the owner of property by inheritance, purchase, or construction, shall
have the right to select and hold that part of his building which he prefers,
as well as the one not selected.
Warehouses intended for the storage of merchandise shall not be included in the
division above mentioned, but shall remain untouched and free, and shall be
protected from any injury by guests, and shall be set apart for the sole use of
the owners, or lessees.
If, however, there should be no stable in the third part of the house assigned
to the military (as is usually the case), a portion of the outbuildings shall
be set apart for that purpose, according to the number of animals which require
shelter, or the size of the house, unless the owner should make some other
arrangement.
To promote hospitality, We decree that half of a house, instead of a third,
shall be reserved for the use of persons of illustrious rank; under the
condition, however, that one of the parties (if he is free and desires to do
so) shall make a division of the building in accordance with justice, and the
other have the right to take his choice, and We order that this shall remain
unchanged; and those enjoying the rank of illustrious are hereby notified that
if they take more than We have established by a general rule, and rashly
violate the latter, they shall be compelled to pay a fine of thirty pounds of
gold to Our Treasury, and the others be deprived of their positions.
3. The Same Emperors.
We desire all judges to know that whenever they are present, Praetors must not
render ordinary decisions.
4. The Same Emperors.
We order that the obligation to receive soldiers as guests shall not be imposed
upon artisans, no matter where their houses may be, and
that the same exemption shall also be granted at Antioch, and other cities
where factories are situated, of course in the absence of the Imperial retinue.
5. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius.
We free all members of the Imperial household from any anxiety with reference
to the lodging of soldiers. Therefore, in the first place, no quartermaster
shall encroach upon any public property or private residence, no matter what
right he may claim, or by whom he has been appointed. For We give permission to
any owner, or agent, and even to the people, to drive away anyone who may
attempt to take possession of the premises of another for the purpose of making
such preparations, and he need apprehend no criminal accusation; but he is
notified that the right of private vengeance is granted him, and that he can
legally restrain the first one who comes, as he could a person guilty of
sacrilege.
We also decree that any Governor and his subordinate officials, by whose
direction a field has been set apart for someone forbidden to enter it, shall
be temporarily suspended from office.
We grant hospitality only under the following condition, namely: that nothing
be demanded from the host which is necessary for the sustenance of either man
or beast, that the journey of all be accelerated and continuous, and that no
one shall be permitted to long remain, lest a protracted stay may cause some
injury to the property. Any superintendent, collector, or subordinate officer,
while serving in the army, or on a journey, shall be punished with a fine of
ten pounds of gold if he demands anything from those in whose house he has
obtained lodging. We wish in this way to abolish the custom of certain wicked
persons, so that if they should be proved to have voluntarily obtained
anything, contrary to Our order, they shall not remain unpunished.
6. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian.
It is also provided that no improper demands shall be required under the
pretext of hospitality, nor can anyone even ask a bath from the owner of the
house.
7. The Same Emperor.
Soldiers returning from the army, or leaving for the seat of war, shall be
lodged at the base of towers on the walls of the Imperial City.
8. The Same Emperors.
We order that the Chief Physicians of Our palace, as well as professors of
letters in the City of Rome, and those employed in the necessary, or liberal
arts, together with teachers of painting (provided they are freeborn) shall be
exempt from furnishing lodgings as long as they live.
9. The Same Emperors.
All those who are required to furnish lodgings in their houses, whether they do
so on the requisition of quartermasters, or whether
they have been promised indemnity under some agreement, cannot be compelled to
suffer the annoyance of charges or contributions on account of their houses.
Hence We do not wish that anyone of this Flourishing City, or anywhere else, no
matter what his rank or position, after having had his own house exempted by a
military privilege from the obligation of lodging soldiers, can himself demand
to be lodged in the house of others. This rule must also be observed in the
provinces; and We refuse this right of having their houses exempt to all those
upon whom an illustrious dignity has been conferred, either while they still
hold it, or after it has been relinquished by them.
We order that these regulations shall, likewise, be observed with reference to
those whose administration of office has rendered them distinguished, even
where they have obtained from Us the title of illustrious. All persons are
hereby notified that, when anyone who has had an honor conferred upon him, and
has secured the privilege of having his house exempt from lodging soldiers, so
far as a third part of it is concerned, demands at the same time lodging for
himself in the houses of others, on the ground that he has a right to the
exemption because of the honor which was conferred upon him, he shall be
deprived of the legal privileges which he has attempted to abuse.
When, however, he is included among those upon whom no dignity has been
bestowed, he shall be fined ahundred pounds of gold for the benefit of the
Treasury of the Imperial Largesses.
10. The Emperors Valentinian and Martian.
We order, by this law, that if anyone should have obtained both consular and
patrician rank, he shall enjoy the right to have three of his houses exempt,
and to hold them secure from the obligation of lodging guests; and his heirs,
his sons, his father and his mother, his grandchildren as well as his brother,
his sister and his wife, shall enjoy the privilege of having two of their
houses exempt. One who has only obtained the honors of the consulship shall
have two-thirds of his houses exempt, and, after his death, his heirs shall
have the right to have one-third of their houses free from the obligation of
lodging soldiers. One who has been decorated with the dignity of patrician, but
not with that of-the consulship, shall be entitled to the same privilege as the
heirs above mentioned. Prefects, as well as generals of the army, as long as
they live, shall have two houses exempt from furnishing lodgings. Heirs of the
above-mentioned persons, however, can only protect one of their houses by a
similar exemption. Masters of the Offices, or Quaestors, shall have only one-
third of their houses free from the obligation of lodging soldiers during their
lives, and their heirs shall only have a single house exempt. The Counts of
Domestics, of the Protectors of the Imperial Largesses and of Private Affairs,
as well as the eminent Primicerius,and Chief of Notaries, shall each have all
their houses free from the burden of furnishing lodgings during their lifetime;
but their heirs are notified that they can only enjoy this privilege for half
of one of their houses, and the third part of the remaining half shall be
assigned for the use of guests.
Where illustrious persons have demanded any honorary exemptions whatsoever,
without having obtained the consent of the Emperor, they shall, after the
promulgation of this decree, give up all their houses to guests instead of the
third prescribed by law, with the exception of buildings set apart for the
storage of supplies, which are situated in streets or narrow lanes.
We order that this rule shall be observed with reference to all houses which
are subject to the obligation of lodging, so that no one can allege any ground
for exemption on account of an Imperial rescript, annotation, or pragmatic
sanction; and the provisions which We have established by this law shall be
observed by all persons in this Eternal City.
11. The Emperor Zeno.
We order that the ten tribunes, in their order of rank, after the
primicerius,shall be exempt from the obligation of furnishing lodging in the
houses which they own in this Imperial City.
12. This Law is not Authentic.
TITLE XLII.
CONCERNING SUPPLIES WHICH SHOULD NOT BE FURNISHED TO GUESTS.
1. The Emperor Constantine.
No one in the name of counts, tribunes, officers, or soldiers shall, under the
pretext of supplies, extort from their hosts mattresses, wood, or oil, nor
shall he take anything of this kind, even with the consent of his hosts, but
the inhabitants of our provinces shall be safe from impositions of this kind,
and all counts, tribunes, officers, and soldiers who exact them will be liable
to severe punishment.
TITLE XLIII. CONCERNING FURLOUGHS.
1. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius.
No commander, chief of cohorts, their lieutenants or friends, shall be
permitted, at any time during an expedition, to grant soldiers leave of absence
from the camp and their standards, even in places where they are stationed, no
matter what their rank may be.
If anyone should be so bold as to violate this law, and, contrary to its
provisions, should grant a furlough to a soldier at a time when an attack of
the barbarians is expected, and when the soldiers ought to be in camp, under
their standards, he shall be punished with death.
2. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius.Persons employed in the
offices of the Imperial Secretaries, of those of the Agents for the Transaction
of Business, or of those of the
Palatines, and any official charged with the distribution of Imperial and
private rewards, who has been absent for the space of six months after the
expiration of his furlough or order to depart, shall be degraded to a place
after the five which immediately follow him.
Moreover, anyone who, unmindful of the commands which he has received,
voluntarily remains absent for a year after the expiration of his furlough,
shall be degraded to the eleventh rank among those serving below him; and
finally, if anyone should neglect his duties in this respect for the term of
four years, he shall be placed after the fortieth of those who succeed him.
Those who do not appear after the end of the fourth year shall, with good
reason, be stricken from the rolls of the army.
3. The Emperors Honorius and Valentinian.
If any soldier, without having obtained leave of absence, should pass a year at
home, or anywhere else in idleness, he shall be reduced ten grades; if he
should be convicted of having been absent for two years, he shall be reduced
twenty; if he should be absent for three years, he shall be reduced thirty; and
one who, having been absent for four years, has been stricken from the rolls of
the army, shall not be pardoned.
TITLE XLIV. CONCERNING NEW RECRUITS.
1. The Emperors Valentinian and Theodosius.No raw recruit, veteran, or any
employee of the Census shall be admitted into the army.
2. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius.
Any slave who enlists as a recruit, after having been convicted, shall be
compelled to pay a pound of gold to Our Treasury, and shall then be restored to
his master, if the latter was not aware of what he had done.
3. The Emperor Anastasius.
New recruits should always be placed in the rear ranks of the army, and We do
not permit any of them to obtain a higher place, unless their assiduity in the
discharge of their duties and the requirements of the service render this
advisable.
TITLE XLV.
CONCERNING THE PROTECTION OF THE SHORES OP THE SEA, AND HIGHWAYS.
1. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius.
We decree, by this most salutary law, that prohibited merchandise shall not be
transported to barbarous nations; and that any vessels which depart from any
port or shore shall not be molested, or sustain
any damage; provided, however, that their masters state for what province they
are bound; so that this having been proved, they cannot afterwards be subjected
to any indignity or annoyance.
TITLE XLVI. CONCERNING DESERTERS AND THOSE WHO HARBOR THEM.
1. The Emperor Theodosius.
If any person should receive a deserter on his land or under his roof, and
permit him to remain concealed for a considerable time on his premises, the
steward or agent of the place, who knowingly and intentionally committed such
an offence, shall be subjected to capital punishment, and the owner of the
property where the deserter remained concealed shall be punished with the loss
of the same, if he was aware of the facts. Again, when any freeborn person
betrays a deserter, he shall obtain the ownership of the property by way of
reward. We do not merely speak of those who, serving under fortunate standards,
respect the rules of discipline, but also of those who, while receiving their
pay, are shown to have revealed the hiding place of deserters. He shall be
considered a deserter who absents himself from his standards in time of war.
A soldier who voluntarily returns shall not be liable to punishment for his
offence, but anyone who conceals himself through criminal idleness should be
denounced by him in whose house he has taken refuge, or by the public
officials; and, wherever he may be found, shall be given up to the vengeance of
the authorities to suffer death by the sword. When the Governor of a province,
either through favor or dissimulation, defers inflicting the penalty, he shall
be subjected to the loss of his property and reputation, and officials of
superior rank who are guilty of this offence shall be put to death.
2. The Emperor Leo.
If deserters, after having been found, attempt to resist and defend themselves
by arms, they shall be punished as rebels on account of their rashness; and
Governors of provinces must use great caution lest such persons may attempt to
protect themselves from the crime of desertion by the use of forged documents,
and prevent them from escaping by the aid of false or counterfeit letters.
3. The Same Emperor.
Those soldiers who, after having left their camps, commit depredations or
robbery, shall not escape the severity of the magistrate.
TITLE XLVII. CONCERNING VETERANS. 1. The Emperor Constantine.
When the Emperor was saluted by the prefects, tribunes, and distinguished
officers, he was acclaimed as follows: "Emperor Constan-
tine, God preserve you for us, for your safety is ours; we speak the truth, and
we confirm it by our oaths." The assembled veterans cried out: "Emperor
Constantine, what will become of us, if we have no privileges?" The Emperor
replied: "I should increase the happiness of My veterans more and more, rather
than diminish it." The veteran Victorinus said: "We are not allowed to be
ordered to all places for the discharge of duty and the performance of military
service."
The Emperor Constantine responded: "State more clearly what are the principal
disabilities under which you labor." All the veterans answered: "You yourself
are aware of them." The Emperor Constantine replied: "From this moment, through
My liberality, I perceive that it is necessary for the privilege to be granted
you that no veteran shall be obliged to perform any civil duty, or public
service, pay any tax imposed by magistrates, contribute anything to the
markets, or be subject to any imposition on account of sales. The framers of
the revenue, also, shall not interfere with veterans who, after their long
service, shall forever enjoy tranquillity.
"By the same letter, We also forbid the Treasury to molest veterans in any way,
but they shall be permitted to buy and sell, earn money by engaging in any
profitable business, trade in merchandise, and shall not only enjoy these
privileges in quiet and peace during Our reign, but We do not permit them to be
liable to municipal duties, that is, to any corporeal or personal service, or
to any charge for transportation."
2. The Same Emperor.
Provision should be made that veterans who have been raised to the dignity of
protectors, or who have attained various honors on account of their merit,
shall not be subjected to scurrilous abuse of any kind. If anyone should be
convicted of this offence, the Governors of the provinces having jurisdiction,
after having ascertained the facts, must punish the guilty party in accordance
with his rank.
3. The Same Emperor.
Veterans who, through negligence, do not cultivate their lands, or lead honest
lives, but commit robberies, shall be deprived of all of the privileges of
their order, and shall suffer the penalties imposed by the Governors of the
provinces.
4. The Emperors Theodosius.
No one who has ceased to belong to the army can be obliged again to enter the
service, either with his consent or without it. The decisions of magistrates
which have been rendered in violation of this provision shall have no validity,
except when it is found that the investigation began at a time when the accused
party was still in the army, for then We order that the case shall be heard and
decided by the military judges, as the accused person was still in the service,
unless the parties can defend themselves under a privilege specially granted by
the Emperor.
TITLE XLVIII.
CONCERNING THE SONS OF MILITARY OFFICERS WHO DIE DURING WAR.
1. The Emperor Constantine.
The sons of military officers, whether their fathers are still in the service
or have been discharged, are called to the same division to which their fathers
belonged.
2. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius.
The sons of centurions of first companies of the triariimust follow the
condition of their fathers.
3. This Law is not Authentic.
TITLE XLIX. CONCERNING THE OFFERING OF GOOD WISHES.
1. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius.
When the Happy New Year is begun by a common exchange of good wishes, We freely
receive what is offered to the officers in pounds of gold and solidiof full
weight; ordering that, hereafter, in subsequent years, everyone shall bring and
bestow gifts of this description upon his commander.
TITLE L.
CONCERNING ACCOUNTANTS, RECORDERS, CLERKS, ASSISTANTS, SECRETARIES AND
COLLECTORS OF THE CAPITAL, AND OTHER JUDICIAL OFFICERS, MILITARY AS WELL AS
CIVIL.
1. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens.
The insatiable and fraudulent conduct of accountants, who perform different
services for the Governors, must be restrained, as we formerly ordered, and now
again order, by subjecting them to torture, placing them upon the rack, and
lacerating their flesh.
2. The Emperors Gratian and Theodosius.
Those who were formerly called the accountants of Consuls and Governors shall,
hereafter, by this Our law, be designated registrars, and are notified that
they will be liable to torture if they do not frequently render reports of
their administration in writing either to the judges, or to those who, under
Our authority, visit the provinces, or to the collectors of debts and other
claims.
They are also notified that they will be liable to payment along with debtors,
unless all obligations are discharged upon their demand; still, I order that
the term of two years shall be granted registrars to comply with this law.
3. The Same Emperors.
We direct the accountants attached to your office to wear the belt, and have
the rank of soldiers.
4. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius.
In every province two accountants, styled registrars, shall be appointed, one
of whom shall have charge of the accounts of the Treasury, and the other
control of that of the Largesses; and both of them are hereby warned that if
anything should be unlawfully removed, or misappropriated during the
administration of either, he who has concealed his guilt from the judge shall
be subjected to the severest punishment.
5. The Same Emperors.
We forbid officials belonging to the retinues of provincial judges, who are not
attached to the cohortal service, and receive no pay from the Treasury, to have
any apprehensions of being molested in the discharge of their duties, even when
they are decurions; provided they perform the municipal functions of their
respective cities; and, after having retired from office, they should not
forget to return to their own curise.
6. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius.
In order that the recorders of military organizations may not be assisted by
their colleagues to the detriment of all concerned, Your Illustrious Highness
will order all soldiers of the division to avoid associating or entertaining
any relations with them. If, after having been warned, they fail to obey
orders, there is no doubt that they can be subjected to the same penalties as
the recorders themselves.
7. The Emperor Leo.
Your Highness will see that the Recorders of the City of Constantinople, as
well as of Thymela, and of the different curiasof other cities, are not
appointed except with the approval of the Emperor, as has been customary. If
anyone within your jurisdiction should be convicted of having done what is
forbidden by this law, he shall be suitably punished.
8. The Same Emperor.
We order that the secretaries and accountants attached to the office of Your
Highness shall, hereafter, under no circumstances, borrow money, or be
compelled to render themselves liable to anyone for public expenses, as We do
not wish them to be subjected to any annoyance after having retired from
military service.
9. The Emperors Leo Junior and Zeno.
We order that, hereafter, no one without regard to his military rank shall
perform the duties of bookkeeper, or, after having retired from that
employment, shall aspire to service in the army; for, where
anyone transacting business for individuals is deprived of all military
privileges, it will be of no use for him to attempt to carry on any trade or
commit any fraud with reference to the accounts for the correctness of which he
is responsible.
10. The Emperor Zeno.
No secretary shall be permitted to accept the services of accountants more than
four times, nor to continue them in this employment. We decree that this rule
shall be observed with reference to notaries, when for a time they aid
accountants, so that the continuance of their service, as assistants, shall be
interrupted by an interval of two years, and for notaries by an interval of
one. Permission is not given to assistants to descend to the rank of notaries,
except when they have once been dismissed, so that, in the countries of the
East, the services of temporary assistants shall be granted to accountants,
provided they are selected out of thirty whose names have been suggested by the
accountant himself. In the provinces of Asia, also, they shall be appointed by
the accountant from fifty whose names have been mentioned by the latter; and in
the provinces of Pontus and Thrace, the power of selecting assistants from all
the people shall be indiscriminately granted to accountants at their pleasure.
(1) It is necessary for all notices, orders, claims and, generally speaking,
any public documents whatever, not only to be examined and signed by the
assistants, but also that mention shall be made of the others with whom the
contract was entered into, as well as of the notary who examined and signed the
document.
(2) If any instrument should be issued from any bureau in the East, in Asia or
in Thrace, without the observance of this provision, the officer responsible
shall be prosecuted for forgery, with the exception of such public documents as
may proceed from the offices of the Secretary of the Provinces of Pontus, for
the reason that Your Highness has established the rule that the assistant and
notary shall alone sign such papers; so that, if this law should be violated in
any respect, the accountants shall be punished by the loss of rank and pay for
the term of a year; but the assistants shall be fined fifty pounds of gold, and
the notaries fifteen pounds of gold by way of penalty.
11. The Same Emperors.
In pursuance of petitions presented to the office of Your Highness, praying
that the time within which the documents of accountants shall be valid, be
fixed, not for the term of two years, but for that of one year, We, approving
these petitions, revoke the provision promulgated with reference to the term of
two years, and substitute therefor the term of only one year.
12. The Emperor Anastasius.
We order, by this Imperial pragmatic sanction, that what formerly was
prescribed with reference to praetorian tribunes, which dignity was conferred
upon those who had retired from military service in
the office of Your Highness, shall be re-established, and that this honor shall
be conferred upon them, in addition to any which they at present enjoy, so that
the decree releasing them from military duty shall also contain the mention of
the honor aforesaid.
This shall also suffice to enable them to obtain that dignity and the
privileges attached to the same, without any special order issued with the
sanction of the Emperor; provided, however, that by a decision of the said
authority, they obtain the distinction of Count of the First Rank, that is to
say Cornicularius,Notary, First Secretary, Chief-Accountant of the Bureaus of
Macedonia and Decia, Inspector of Public Works, and State Treasurer.
This rule shall also apply to those who, after the promulgation of the New
Constitution of the Emperor Zeno of Divine Memory, have relinquished their
military rank; which constitution refers to the same penalties and the same
persons.
TITLE LI.
CONCERNING THE PUBLIC POST, POST-HORSES, AND VEHICLES.
1. The Emper.or Constantine.
We decree that the horses set apart for the service of the public post shall be
urged on, not with clubs or sticks, but only with whips; and those who violate
this law shall be punished.
2. The Same Emperor.
Permission is refused to Governors, Receivers of the Public Treasury, and other
persons in the service of the State who distribute grain and provender for
cattle, to make use of post-horses. Nor shall anyone have the right to travel
on any other road than the public highway, with the exception of Your Highness,
who is entitled to use the public vehicles and to travel wherever reason or
necessity demands.
3. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius.
Permits for travel can be demanded by everyone, and judges, as well as guards
of the public posts, shall permit no one to pass without first having examined
his permit. When anyone refuses to produce it, or is convicted of travelling
without one, or attempts to use the public posts beyond the time specified by
his permit, We order that he shall be arrested wherever found, and if he is in
the enjoyment of any dignity, his case shall be referred to you, and to the
illustrious Count and Master of the Offices. Moreover, a penalty which you
think to be proper must be inflicted upon others, dependent upon the place
where they have been arrested, and their rank in the army.
4. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius.
He shall be presumed to have a mounted comrade, who, while only one or two
horses are mentioned in his permit, takes a third. This,
however, does not make any difference, and it should not be considered a crime
for anyone in the transaction of his business to take a journey, or to commit
his affairs to a courier, provided he does not violate the terms of his permit.
5. The Emperor Theodosius.
When anyone, no matter what his dignity or military rank may be, while
travelling in a public vehicle, turns aside from the direct route, a suitable
penalty shall be inflicted upon him.
6. The Same Emperors.
We have granted members of the Senate the right to make use of public
conveyances when they travel, where it is necessary for them to come to Us;
provided, however, that they do this either when they are summoned by Us, or
when they depart from Our court. Therefore, if anyone should hereafter rashly
presume to make use of a public conveyance contrary to what has been provided,
he will incur Our displeasure.
7. The Same Emperor.
The fourth part of the post-horses shall be replaced in every province, but it
is unreasonable for the stables to be built at public expense. Hence We have
decided that this shall be done at the charge of the provinces in which the
stables are situated, as they are very advantageous not only to the public but
also to the people of the provinces, to whom we give the manure of the animals
by way of compensation.
8. The Emperor Valentinian.
In order that moderation may be observed in travelling, two post-horses shall
be dispatched each way every day, and the penalty of five pounds of gold shall
be imposed upon those who fail to observe this regulation.
9. The Emperor Leo.
We deny to judges the power to grant permission to travel in public
conveyances, as this privilege is solely reserved for Us, yourself, and the
illustrious Master of the Offices; for it is not granted either to the Prefect
of the City, to the generals or commanders of armies, to vicegerents, or to
anyone else, except the two officials above mentioned, to whom this privilege
has been conceded by Us. Judges have the right to allow this privilege only to
persons whom they know to be engaged in the exercise of public functions, and
they are notified that if they violate Our law that they will be fined twenty-
five pounds of gold, and their subordinates will be fined fifty.
10. The Same Emperor.
Under the severe penalties above imposed, We forbid persons engaged in buying
and selling to make contracts for transportation, and to treat animals
belonging to the public as merchandise.
11. The Same Emperor.
No private individual shall make use of the privilege of having horses
furnished, even though he may have the right to ask it.
12. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius.
As, for the same reason, the care of post-horses should become the subject of
discussion, We decree that the saddle, with the bridle, shall be valued at six
pounds of gold, and that a horse shall not be valued at more than the same sum,
with the understanding that, if anyone should exceed the amount established by
the Emperor, the saddle shall be confiscated to the Treasury, with the
exception of the gold ornaments which are required to be kept by the groom in
bags provided for that purpose.
13. The Same Emperors.
We do not permit grooms to be annoyed by the shameful depredations of those who
use post-horses; and, therefore, if anyone should remove or cut off any of the
harness of the horses, the wretch shall be punished by the judges and
inspectors of highways. All persons are hereby notified that if Our order is
not obeyed, the guilty party will be compelled not only to make good all losses
sustained, but will also be branded with infamy, and fined.
14. The Same Emperors.
The charge of the public post shall, in accordance with the custom of the
neighborhood, be committed either to the decurions, the cohor-tals, or to those
who are willing to receive it from the Eminent Prefecture, on their own
responsibility.
15. The Emperor Zeno.
If anyone should think that he can bring an extra horse with him for a journey,
he shall pay the Treasury four times the value of the animals brought in excess
of the prescribed number.
16. The Same Emperor.
Those only shall be permitted to use public vehicles who, being sent as envoys
by different nations, desire to arrive speedily in Our presence.
17. The Same Emperor.
Let no one dare to remove a driver attached to the postal service from his
duties, either by solicitation or by receiving him, under the penalty of ten
pounds of silver.
18. The Same Emperor.
When forage is valued at a high and exhorbitant price, animals belonging to the
public are openly ill treated by slaves and attendants, and, to avoid this
taking place, Your Highness must see that forage is not lacking at the
different stations, and that the inhabitants of the
provinces are not subjected to annoyance beyond what is reasonable and just.
19. The Same Emperor.
We have ascertained that the inhabitants of the provinces are compelled to
furnish, at a reasonable rate, not only forage for horses, but also the money
required for the postal service, and that, in addition to this, they are
oppressed by being required .to provide harness for the same. Therefore, the
Governors of provinces must take care that no dispute shall arise with
reference to the public post, and that decurions or provincials are not,
through fraudulent representations, forced to furnish animals which they are
not obliged to.
20. The Same Emperor.
No military commander, after having once entered his province, can, afterwards,
for the purpose of travel, make use of the vehicles or horses belonging to the
postal service, nor can anyone attached to his office do so, but he must use
his own animals even for military expeditions. We order that the same rule
shall apply to the officers of cohorts, so that none of them travelling through
his own province may hereafter attempt to avail himself of a post-horse, as he
will know that this is prohibited by an Imperial Constitution.
When any military commander, or any of his retinue, or any officer of a cohort,
thinks that he can violate what We have decreed, he shall be fined a pound of
gold for every animal which he has made use of.
21. The Emperor Anastasius.
No one, no matter to what order he may belong, or what rank he may hold, or
what duties he may discharge in the Holy Church, or the Imperial palace can,
during an expedition, employ any animal or vehicle belonging to the postal
service.
22. The Emperor Justinian.
We decree that the ambulatory post shall be abolished and suppressed throughout
the entire East, as well as in the cities of other regions, under the
jurisdiction of Your Highness; provided, however, that where We have made any
arrangement for the passage of Our brave soldiers, and ordered their transfer
from one place to another, a requisition shall be made on the Treasury of Your
Highness for the transport and repair of arms, and payment be made to owners,
who are accustomed to hire out their animals; and We decree that, under the
above-mentioned circumstances, no judge but yourself, no matter what his rank
may be, shall have power to grant the use of such animals.
23. The Same Emperor.
Weorder that no oneno matter to what organization he may belong, what office
he may hold, what military rank he may have, or what his status may be,
throughout the entire region of the East, and
regardless of the reason for his journey, or his returnshall employ more than
one horse either belonging to the Government or to himself, even if the judge
has permitted him to take more than one, unless a special permit has been
granted by Us, setting forth the number of animals which he shall be entitled
to use; those, however, undoubtedly being excepted who are engaged in
transporting the public money; for, in this instance, it is proper that as many
animals be furnished, without Our express authority, as may be required for the
transport and protection of the coin; and anyone who, at any time or in any
way, violates Our commands, or permits them to be violated, shall be condemned
to pay a fine of fifty pounds of gold.
TITLE LII. CONCERNING DRIVERS AND STATIONS.
1. The Emperor Constantine.
Drivers of post-horses are only entitled to two days, in addition to the
ordinary delays, at the different stations, and no longer time shall be granted
to anyone, even if he is accompanied by necessary persons, unless he is one of
those who have charge of animals and horses intended for the use of the
Emperor; so that, after having been sent back to the Organization of Drivers,
he can be allotted the number of five days, and no one shall have authority to
remain beyond that period of time in any place that he pleases.1
1 It was not until the foundation of the Empire that a regular, systematic
postal service was established by the Romans. During the existence of the
Republic, special messengers were employed as occasion required, whenever it
was found necessary to communicate with military commanders, government
officials, or foreign potentates. No private individual could, in those early
times, make use of the post, except by permission of the authorities, and,
under the Empire, this privilege became still more difficult to secure, and was
only obtainable by the written consent of the Emperor himself. To Augustus is
due the credit of the organization of the postal system which, facilitating and
maintaining intercourse with the most distant provinces and cities, was one of
the greatest and most important factors of Roman civilization. It was, first
and last, a purely official institution, designed to inform the sovereign at
the Capital of what transpired everywhere throughout his dominions, in order
that he might, at all times, and especially in cases of emergency, provide for
his own security and the continuance of his power. Post-houses were established
at frequent intervals where young men of approved intelligence and activity
were stationed, charged with the care of horses and vehicles, as well as with
the speedy transmission of despatches, and the expediting of officials, whose
duties carried them either to Rome, or compelled them to journey to the
frontiers of the Empire. Suetonius refers to the organization of the postal
service by Augustus as follows: "Et quo celerius ac sub manum annunciare
cognoscique posset, quid in provincia quaque gereretur, juvenes prima modicis
intervallis per mttitares vias, dehinc vehicula, disposuit." (De Vita Ceesarum,
Octav, August,XLIX.)
Inspectors, styled euriosi,were appointed in every province, whose duty it was
to see that supplies were furnished, animals provided, and every facility
afforded government officials in the prosecution of their public errands. Forty
horses were ordinarily allotted to a station, and so excellently and thoroughly
was the service managed that, in case of necessity, nearly two hundred miles
could be traversed
TITLE LIII.
CONCERNING THE SUBORDINATES OF THE PRAETORIAN PREFECTS AND THEIR PRIVILEGES.
1. The Emperor Leo.
We desire that the officials of the Prefecture who retire every year shall do
Us homage after their terms have expired; and when they have done so, We grant
them the right to enjoy repose, so that they shall not be compelled to accept
any office or employment of any description whatever.
2. The Same Emperors.
We forbid the subordinates of praetorian prefects to interfere with the
collection of taxes in the provinces, to the injury of the people, or for their
own advantage; and, moreover, We do not allow them to act as guards of
warehouses, or to assume any of the rights or authority of the curias.If one of
them should be so rash as to violate the present
in a day; the accomplishment of one hundred, a great distance in those times,
was not an unusual performance. A judge or proconsul, travelling post, could
calculate, within an hour, when he would arrive at his destination.
The military roads of the Romans have no counterpart in works constructed for
this purpose anywhere, at the present day. Of more than a yard in thickness,
and composed of alternate layers of concrete, cement, and stone, they seem to
have been built for eternity. They were fourteen or fifteen feet wide, and, in
the time of the Antonines, were three hundred and seventy-two in number,
aggregating more than sixty-four thousand miles. The cost of construction has
been estimated by competent authority at about a billion and a half dollars.
These roads were laid out in perfectly straight lines, when this was at all
practicable, without taking into consideration any natural obstacles that might
be encountered: ascending mountain summits, crossing wide and treacherous
streams by means of massive bridges, and traversing deserts to which building
materials had to be transported from great distances. Under the Republic, the
censors, who were the directors of public works, had control of the highways;
but during the Imperial era, their charge was committed to officials designated
curatores viarum,who were held responsible for the repair and preservation of
these all-important means of communication, upon which depended the safety and
integrity of the Empire.
The post of the Romans being, to all intents and purposes, restricted to the
use and convenience of the government, bears little analogy to the extensive
and vastly complicated mailing systems of the present age. The monopoly of this
method of receiving and transmitting intelligence gave the Emperor an enormous
advantage, equal, if not superior, to the control of the army. By means of it
the administration of government was thoroughly centralized; information of the
presence of an enemy, or the existence of rebellion, became known to the
capital almost immediately; new laws were published in the most remote
provinces a few hours after their enactment; and the subjects and tributaries
of the Empire were made acquainted with any important or even trivial events
transpiring in the Eternal City. In order to foster this interchange of
communication, news-letters, or journals, called acta,issued under government
supervision, were regularly despatched and distributed. The effect of these
measures upon the promotion of national unity and pride, upon the education of
all classes, upon the increase and security of commercial transactions, and the
consequent prosperity and happiness of the people in general, may readily be
imagined. No institution of Roman genius did more for mankind than the
establishment of the Imperial postal-service, originally established, and
subsequently perpetuated in the interest of despotism.ED.
law, We wish him to be subjected to a penalty in proportion to the gravity of
his offence.
3. The Emperor Anastasius.
The officers of the Praetorian Prefect, his principal secretaries and
accountants, in addition to all those who, in the office of Your Highness and
in the course of the performance of their military duties, desire to rest from
their labors shall, by way of reward for the many hardships endured for the
State, always be exempt from every civil or military tax, and be subject to the
jurisdiction of civil judges, and not to that of those belonging to the army.
We decree that the following provision shall be added to this law, namely: that
if any officer attached to the Prefecture should, either while he is in active
service, or after he has retired, die without making a properly executed will,
and leave no legal heirs, his entire estate shall not escheat to the Imperial
Treasury, but can be claimed by the treasurers of Your Highness. We concede to
your secretaries and collectors, as well as to all other persons attached to
your office, who serve in Our First Legion, the right to a hearing, solely in
cases where proceedings have been brought against them. We order that those who
reside in the provinces shall, however, only answer before the Governors,
unless the performance of some public duty has been imposed upon them.
TITLE LIV.
CONCERNING THE ATTENDANTS OF THE PREFECT OF THE
CITY.
1. The Emperors Oration, Valentinian, and Theodosius.
No one, with the exception of those belonging to the retinue of eminent
officials having charge of the collection of taxes, of posts, and of the Urban
Prefecture, shall be permitted each year to appear before the Emperor and
render his homage. None of the incumbents of office in the provinces shall have
the right to come before the Emperor and adore him, and all privileges of this
kind are hereby abolished.
2. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius.
Any attendant of the Illustrious Prefecture of the City who has, by fraud,
deceived the baker of the palace, shall, after having been accused and
convicted, remain forever attached to the Organization oi Bakers.
TITLE LV.
CONCERNING THE STAFF OFFICERS OR GENERALS AND
THEIR PRIVILEGES.
1. The Emperors Valens, Valentinian, and Gratian.Those who hold the offices of
generals of cavalry and infantry are released from the responsibility of any
appointment.
2. The Emperors Theodosii and Valentinian.
Those who, while discharging the duties of generals of cavalry or infantry,
have drawn any office by lot, shall be considered members of the Military
Order.
3. The Emperor Martian.
We do not wish the attendants attached to the offices of magistrates, or
members of curiseor cohorts, to be enrolled for service in the Census.
4. The Same Emperor.
We decree that persons having charge of the accounts of generals, whether they
are attached to the immediate service of the Emperor, or are serving in the
East, and who have been admitted to the privileges and receive the pay of
soldiers, when they retire from office, shall live with the praetorian tribunes
of the Military Order, and be treated by them with the respect to which they
are entitled by their labors; so that, after the ranks of the army are
complete, they may be exempt from all contributions, as well as from all
military and civil duties. We wish that those of them who occupy the highest
positions shall rank with the military tribunes of the guards.
5. The Emperor Zeno.
We order that those under your command (provided they are registered among the
number established by law) shall enjoy the prescription of the bar, but that
those who are above this number, and are regarded as not included in the
military service, shall be excluded, and assigned to the Illustrious
Prefecture, and the distinguished Governors of the provinces, without being
allowed to avail themselves of this prescription, which is the peculiar
privilege of soldiers.
TITLE LVI.
CONCERNING THE ATTENDANTS OF THE PROCONSUL AND THE LIEUTENANT OF THE EMPEROR.
1. The Emperor Constantine.
We do not wish any decurions, or members of some other body, to be attached to
your office, and if there should be any of these acting as your attendants, We
order that they shall be immediately restored to the duties which they are
required to perform.
2. The Emperors Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian.
We are of the opinion that four hundred deputies should be set apart for the
service of your office from among those against whom no complaint can be made
by any member of the Government.
3. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius.
In any province where there is a proconsul, his duty requires him to perform
those functions which are customary, and not insolently interfere with other
matters.
TITLE LVIL
CONCERNING THE ATTENDANTS OF THE COUNT OF THE
EAST.
1. The Emperor Zeno.
Not more than six hundred attendants shall be attached to the office of Count
of the East, which number We are satisfied will be sufficient for the
requirements of the public.
TITLE LVIII.
CONCERNING THE ATTENDANTS ATTACHED TO THE
COHORTS OF PRINCES AND THEIR CORNICULARII AND
PRIMIPILARII.
1. The Emperor Constantine.
Soldiers stationed in garrisons shall not venture to extort more taxes than are
due, nor put anyone into prison, nor, themselves, keep anyone in custody, even
though he may be clearly guilty of crime. Anyone who commits an offence of this
kind is hereby notified that he will be punished with death.
2. The Emperors Theodosius, Arcadius, and Honorius.
No judge shall presume to try or convict anyone, unless evidence is given under
oath. We, however, except those who have charge of the public post in the
provinces, for the general welfare does not permit assistance to be refused in
a service of such importance.
3. The Same Emperors.
We also extend to ordinary privileges which were granted by the Emperor
Diocletian to the cohortals of Syria, and We order that they shall not be
required to transport necessary supplies for either the army or navy, and that
they shall not be inscribed upon the registers of the curisewithout their
consent. When, however, their military service has expired, and the duties of
the Chief Centurion properly discharged, We grant them the right of exemption.
4. The Same Emperors.
We desire that the subordinates of the Governors of the provinces subject to
your authority shall be notified that, after having been installed in their
offices, or accepted in the name of the cohorts or legions, they shall be
entitled to all privileges.
5. The Same Emperors.
Any centurion in Osroena, who rejoices in the possession of a large number of
sons, can appoint one of them to his place, as succeeding to it by hereditary
right; and, by way of showing his devotion to his country, he can place another
in the curiaof ^desena, and pro-
vide for the others in any way that he may desire. If, however, he should only
have two sons, he will be compelled to satisfy the cohort and the curia.Where
he has only one, he must restore him to the Order of his country, and no
privilege will avail against this rule. Hence We grant authority to their
fathers, as well as to those who, by the terms of this law, are placed under
the control of municipalities, to produce any members of a curiafound to be
exempt through the indulgence of princes, in order that they themselves, having
been designated for the discharge of the same duties, may be compelled to
perform them.
6. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius.
If an official subordinate, after having committed a crime, should take to
flight, the edict by which he can be recalled must be complied with, under the
condition prescribed by the laws; and if he does not appear, the court shall
pass sentence upon him as a fugitive from justice, according to the nature of
his offence. We do not grant pardons for crimes of this kind, nor do We remove
them by indulgences.
7. The Emperor Theodosius.
The attendants of ordinary judges, who have attained the rank of investigators,
or continue in their employments, cannot be discharged on account of age or
length of service, before they have rendered their accounts. And if, before the
account has been submitted, he who is liable should think that he is entitled
to dismissal on account of some corporeal disease, or extreme old age, he shall
not obtain it before paying everything due to the centurion.
Moreover, We desire that those who have been dishonorably discharged on account
of the commission of crime shall not, under such circumstances, be permitted to
retain their peculium,but shall be subjected to condign punishment, so that
none of their property shall be removed from the office to which they are
attached, which rule shall apply to the smallest company of the army.
8. The Emperor Valentinian.
In appraising different kinds of military supplies, the same rule shall be
observed with reference to their price as applies to the same articles when
exposed to public sale.
9. The Same Emperor.
A hundred attendants shall be attached to the office of each magistrate in
Illyria (in which province the necessaries of the public welfare especially
demand that employments be granted to the subordinates of Governors) but, in
excess of this number, no person shall aspire to this military rank or remain
in it with the connivance of judges. Again, those who are summoned to the
performance of functions of this kind should not be such as may attempt to
obtain extraordinary profits under the empty name of military service, but
those who will discharge their official duties with proper care and diligence.
10. The Same Emperor.
Anyone who desires to take charge of the papers or registers, or obtain any
other office in the cohorts, shall not be permitted to do so until his name has
first been entered upon the records; and the penalty already prescribed shall
be imposed upon those who think that, contrary to the Imperial enactments, any
persons can be accepted, or any office whatsoever can be bestowed upon them.
11. The Emperor Leo.
When anyone, belonging to the cohorts, has been dismissed from the service on
account of prosecution for crime, or for idleness, if, after having solicited
forgiveness, he should desire to be reinstated in his former position, he shall
be required to present to Your Highness a pardon granted by the Emperor.
12. The Emperor Zeno.
If the attendant of a cohort, or anyone attached to the same, should aspire to
some dignity, he shall be deprived of all the insignia of the honor which he
has obtained, and reduced to his former status. Any children born to him while
in this condition will share the fortune of their father.
(1) If one of them should presume to aspire to military service, he cannot take
advantage of any prescription of time, except that based upon the lapse of
thirty years, but he shall be restored to his former status; nor shall he, or
his children born afterwards, be permitted to refuse to pay what is due to the
cohort.
(2) But in order that the attendant of a cohort, or his son, may not venture to
aspire to another position, the example of his ancestors shall present an
insuperable obstacle.
(3) Moreover, We order that all those who are engaged in different kinds of
trade, as, for instance, money-brokers, jewelers, vendors of silverware and
clothing, apothecaries, and others dealing in various articles of merchandise,
or who have warehouses, shall be exempt from provincial employments, in order
that all honor and military service may be free from contagion of this
description.
13. The Same Emperor.
We do not permit any centurion, or other officer attached to the Imperial
bodyguard, to aspire to any other military place or civil occupation contrary
to the public welfare, or to any other dignity to the prejudice of his former
status. If anyone should be so audacious as to violate this most salutary law,
or any Imperial edict to this effect, his act shall be considered as not having
taken place, even though he may have obtained the position through a special
display of Our indulgence, and We order that, without notifying him who, by the
practice of the above-mentioned arts, has attempted to evade the duties which
he owes to the public, he shall be immediately delivered up to the city from
whence he came.
14. The Emperor Anastasius.
Anyone who, up to this time, has been obliged to discharge official duties in
the cohorts, or was attached to the government of the province, or to any other
branch of the military service, or has been raised to any dignity whatsoever
shall, by no means, be permitted to enjoy the advantages which he has usurped
and obtained contrary to law, even though he may be able to boast that the
right to administer the affairs of a province, or of some command in the army,
or of any other office whatsoever, has been bestowed upon him by a voluntary
act of Our liberality. Henceforth, being deprived of all the benefits of the
condition which he despised, he will not be able to acquire any of them either
himself, or through the intervention of others, but will only be compelled to
discharge the duties of a centurion ; and, from that time during the remainder
of his life, he shall be obliged to perform the functions as a member of the
curiaof the city in which he was born, so that those who, after having aspired
to any kind of military employment, or other office, after having completed
their term of service in the army, must be restored to their native curia.
TITLE LIX.
CONCERNING THE ATTENDANTS OF THE PREFECT OF SUBSISTENCE.
1. The Emperor Antoninus.
The subordinate officials of the Urban Prefecture must not interfere with
matters relative to subsistence, but the duties of the Prefecture of
Subsistence shall be performed by means of the secret emulation of its
attaches.
2. The Emperor Constantine.
The Prefect of Subsistence must collect the taxes required of his office by the
instrumentality of his attendants, and, together with his subordinates, will be
responsible for the exaction of the requisite contributions.
TITLE LX.
CONCERNING THE DIFFERENT OFFICIALS AND ATTENDANTS OF JUDGES, AND THEIR
PREROGATIVES.
1. The Emperor Constantius.
When the Praetorian Prefect, his deputy, or the Governor of a province,
notifies anyone having charge of the public documents or records that he has
been transferred to other duties in the camp or in the army, someone must be
appointed to whom he can render his accounts, and he who is assigned to his
place should preferably be a person eminently worthy of distinction.
2. The Same Emperor.
None of those who have been dishonorably discharged from the army can again
aspire to a place to which they are not entitled, without the consent of the
Emperor. If anyone should fraudulently obtain such a place, he shall be fined
five pounds of gold.
3. The Emperor Justinian.
No attendant of Your Highness, nor anyone attached to the office of the palace
shall, under the pretext of the public welfare, transact the business of a
private individual in the same province in which he was born, or in which he
resides, or where he has already discharged the duties of an employment of this
kind. If this rule should be rashly violated, it will be the duty of the First
Secretary of Your Highness to impose a fine of three pounds of gold upon the
culprit, for the benefit of the Treasury. Moreover, any attendant who permits
himself to be appointed to such a position shall be dismissed from the army.
This penalty shall also be inflicted upon others, for instance, where a
domestic, a protector, an attendant, or an agent for the transaction of
business, or the employee of any office of the palace, persists in an
usurpation of this kind in the same province in which he was born, or in that
where he has established his domicile, and his name shall be stricken from the
rolls; and he who allows himself to hold such an office shall be compelled to
pay a pound of gold to the Treasury. Your subordinates, and the accountants and
notaries of Palatines and counts, shall pay a pound of gold to the Treasury,
unless what has been enacted is observed.
4. The Same Emperor.
Persons who have but little property are not forbidden to serve as attendants.
5. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius.
Any attendants who, after a hearing, have been dismissed on account of some
fault or negligence, cannot hereafter aspire to any military employment; nor
will a rescript be of any advantage to those who may be subjected to a penalty
of exemplary severity, if, contrary to what has been prohibited by the Imperial
Constitutions, they are guilty of contumacy in aspiring to such a position.
6. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian.
No one shall be permitted to hold the following offices, that is to say, those
of the distinguished Proconsul of Asia, Count of the East, Augusta! Prefect,
and their deputies, whom We have warned as being liable to a penalty of thirty
pounds of gold, unless he has been recommended by a letter issued by the
Imperial Secretaries. If any such person in your jurisdiction should be
convicted of this offence, he shall be suitably punished, after the illegal
acts which he committed have been declared to be void.
7. The Same Emperors.
We admit to the highest privilege of military distinction those who, after
having performed with assiduous care the duties required by their former
position, may think that they are worthy to obtain these honors; but not those
who have withdrawn with the intention of indulging their cupidity, or to obtain
a more profitable situation, or for the purpose of concealing crimes which they
have previously committed, or in order to be able afterwards to commit others
with impunity.
8. The Emperor Theodosius.
We decree that the distinguished commanders and their attendants, both those
serving on the frontiers and those in command of camps, shall be solely under
the jurisdiction of Your Highness, and not subject to any other judges;
reserving for the illustrious and eminent generals of the army the power to
decide any controversies arising between the soldiers on the frontiers in the
provinces of the Orient, Thrace, and Illyria, in accordance with long-continued
custom observed up to this time.
9. The Emperor Valentinian.
We decree that the honors to which registrars, clerks, and all other attendants
of the PraBtorian Prefecture of the East, as well as those belonging to the
offices of the different judges are entitled, shall be distributed according to
custom, as prescribed by the Imperial regulations having reference to military
service; and not indiscriminately or arbitrarily, or merely by magisterial
authority alone, or in pursuance of letters drawn up by officers of the army,
but with the authentic and written sanction of the Emperor in accordance with
Our will, so that no deceit or fraud can possibly attach to them, and We order
that only such persons shall be eligible who profess the true and Catholic
faith.
Others, however, who are in the service (unless they belong to the number whom
ancient custom has associated with the corps of attendants by those who
established it) shall not only be dismissed from the service, if, on the
accusation of anyone, they have been found guilty of fraud, but We decree that
they shall undergo the penalty of proscription, and be deprived of all their
property by confiscation.
10. The Same Emperor.
We order, by this law, that hereafter no one shall be allowed to issue permits
to those who should be enrolled in some branch of the military service, who
cannot legally obtain such positions without the approbation of the Emperor;
but the Imperial letters containing Our consent with the signature of those
under whose jurisdiction the applicants are placed shall, at the risk of the
commanding officers of every division, be furnished those who desire to enter
the army.
The above-mentioned documents, signed by the said officers, shall, as is
proper, be deposited with each of the authorities, and although
it is clear that all other magistrates should be excepted from the
: observance of this act of approval, still, in order that no opportunity
.for the assertion of ignorance may remain, We decree that public
notice shall be given by recording the same in the registers of all the
officials who are required to admit such persons into the military
service as are entitled to the same by instruments containing the
sanction of the Emperor.
Therefore, application shall, in obedience to this regulation, hereafter enter
the Imperial service either in Our palace or in any other office whatsoever;
but (as has already been stated) those who are incapacitated by the terms of
the Imperial Constitutions and cannot, either in compliance with ancient custom
or, under the preceding rule requiring the consent of the Emperor, enter his
service as set forth in the following notice, We order may do so; all persons
being hereby notified that if they should attempt, either by connivance or
negligence, to trifle in any respect with the Imperial regulations herein
promulgated, they shall not only be punished by the confiscation of all their
property, but also by death, as being guilty of the crime of deceit.
This notice shall be observed by all the employees of the Imperial Secretaries,
and of those charged with the business of the palace and the Imperial
Largesses, as well as with the private affairs of the Empress. It also applies
to the Secretaries of the Imperial letters; the subordinates of the illustrious
Praetorian Prefectures of the East, of Illyria, and of Rome; to those of the
Proconsuls of Asia and Africa; of the Count of the East; of the Augustal
Prefect; of the Count of the Houses Consecrated to God; of the Vicegerents of
Asia, Pontus, Thrace, and Macedonia; and to the Treasuries of the Roman people.
It is likewise applicable to the Bureau of Imperial Petitions; to the employees
of the generals of both branches of the service; to the Prefect of the East and
Illyria; to all ushers, clerks, teachers, stewards, persons having charge of
the tables and lamps, who are set apart for the service of the Imperial palace;
to the chiefs of the first ten military corps of the Emperor; to the Imperial
couriers, the distinguished generals of Palestine and Mesopotamia, the noble
Counts of Phoenicia, Osrosnia, Syria, the Euphrates, Arabia, Thebes, Lydia,
Pentapolis, both provinces of Armenia, both provinces of Pontus, Scythia, the
first and second provinces of Mysia, Dacia, Pannonia, and the distinguished
Counts of Egypt, Pamphilia, Isauria, Lycaonia, and Pisidia.
TITLE LXI.
CONCERNING EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND COLLECTORS OF
TAXES.
1. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius.
In order that the collector attached to the palace, or the attendants of men of
illustrious rank, may not wander through the different parts of the provinces,
and the dread of military license cause apprehension,
We decree, by this law, that all those who have been mentioned as being under
the jurisdiction of the Governor of a province shall act with him, and that he
shall inspect, order, and supervise everything, so that all business may be
transacted with his approbation and on his responsibility.
2. The Same Emperors.
Anyone attached to Our palace, who is in the provinces for any reason
whatsoever, either for the purpose of compelling obedience to law, collecting
taxes, or as adviser, the bearer of despatches, agent, Palatine or attendant of
illustrious officials, shall only exert such authority as he has been
especially invested with by his decurionate, and shall not, as a colleague,
presume to discharge any duty which someone else has been directed to perform,
so that these persons may not share one another's functions, and all do what
has been entrusted to each individually.
3. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian.
When anyone has been selected from the office of the Pra5tor, from that of the
illustrious Count of the Imperial Largesses, from that of Our Private Affairs,
or from any other place held by a subordinate, to occupy some other position,
he is hereby notified that he must render his accounts to the proper official
within a year, show that he has performed his duty, what collections he has
made as well as what remains unpaid, who are in arrears, and through whose
fault, or for what reason any deficiency has occurred in that province.
If, after the said term of a year has elapsed, he should still be found there,
he shall be arrested as a robber, be removed from office, and condemned to a
fine of ten pounds of gold, if he refuses to return. He shall also be placed in
irons by the officials of the province and subjected to examination, and he
shall not be entitled to defend himself on the ground of any privilege, or the
pretext that some other business or task was subsequently imposed upon him, as
We deprive him of the power to continue to make collections in the said
province.
4. The Emperor Zeno.
We order that no property belonging to another shall be taken for the public or
private debts of any individual.
5. The Emperor Anastasius.
If anyone should, through rashness and insolence, venture to violate Our
orders, the Governor of the province, after having arrested him, shall be
permitted to bring him before Your Highness for prosecution; and, where the
collector is proved to have been guilty of having illegally exacted anything
for himself, the provincial magistrate must punish his temerity as prescribed
by law.
6. The Emperor Justinian.
We order that the collection of public money shall be committed to whoever has
been selected, in accordance with your judgment, or
through the zealous care of the accountants, or magistrates, or under the
direction of those temporarily in charge of the administration of your high
office; but he will not be allowed to take up any other matter before having
disposed of the one in question.
If, however, anyone should happen to depart for the purpose of attending to
public business, in some province, and another case remains to be despatched by
him; he will not be prevented from undertaking the settlement of both of them,
but no more, if he has left this Imperial City, as he is not permitted to
dispose of three without having previously obtained authority to do so from his
official superiors. Those who have undertaken to decide a second case, or have
permitted themselves to determine two at once, or even a third, shall be
punished, not only with the loss of their positions and the confiscation of all
their property, but also with perpetual exile. This same penalty shall be
inflicted upon accountants and their assistants, whose duty it is to see that a
violation of this kind does not occur.
7. This Law is Not Authentic.
TITLE LXII.
CONCERNING THE PROFITS OP ADVOCATES AND THE EXTORTIONS OF OFFICIALS OR THEIR
SUBORDINATES.
1. The Emperor Constantine.
When anyone finds that he has been injured by the military commanders of two
hundred, or one hundred soldiers, or the Advocates of the Treasury, he should
not hesitate to go into court and prove the injury which he has sustained, so
that the guilty party, after having been convicted, may be punished with proper
severity.
2. The Same Emperor.
In addition to the regular and legal contributions required, many extortions
are committed by officials against the people of the provinces, not only in the
different cities, but also in private houses, where they and their animals are
gratuitously entertained. Hence all judges must take care not to permit
injuries of this description to remain unpunished.
3. The Emperors Gratian and Valentinian.
Whenever a collector is accused and convicted of depredations, he must suffer
the penalty prescribed by the law, without appealing to Our clemency.
4. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius.
We desire to come to the relief of members of the curise,and persons interested
in navigation, as well as those of all other organizations, in order that the
attendants of judges may not be permitted in any way to plunder the people of
the provinces.
TITLE LXIII. CONCERNING THE CHIEF CENTURION OF THE TRIARII.
1. The Emperor Gordian.
The pay of centurions of the first rank begins to be due after their
administration, and if anyone entitled to it should die before that time, it
can be claimed by his heirs.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian.
Civil actions should not be transferred to the tribunals of other magistrates
in the name of the Chief Centurion of the Triarii.
3. The Same Emperors.
The public welfare should take precedence of the contracts of private
individuals, and therefore if it should be established that the Treasury has
received what was due to it in the case of the centurion, you can demand the
property hypothecated for the dowry, so that the latter may be paid.
4. The Same Emperors.
As the Emperor Aurelian decreed that children were liable for an obligation
arising solely from the office of centurion held by their father, even though
they were not his heirs, so, if you should not succeed to your father, and have
none of his estate in your possession, the result will be that you cannot be
sued by his creditors.
TITLE LXIV.
THOSE WHO ANNOUNCE THE OCCASIONS OF PUBLIC REJOICING OR THE NAMES OF THE
CONSULS, OR WHO PUBLISH THE IMPERIAL CONSTITUTIONS OR ANY OTHER IMPERIAL OR
JUDICIAL DOCUMENTS, SHOULD NOT RECEIVE EXCESSIVE SUMS FOR EXPENSES FROM PEOPLE
AGAINST THEIR CONSENT.
1. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius.
Where an announcement of public prosperity is to be made, for instance, where
war has ceased; or a victory has been won; or the honor of a royal, a consular,
or any other robe of state is conferred; or where tranquillity follows the
establishment of peace; or where We appear in answer to the demands of the
people; We order that these announcements shall be made and received without
incurring excessive expense.
We decree that the publication shall be unostentatious; that gifts shall be
bestowed upon persons who are in want, and not upon those who are possessed of
wealth; and We order that judges shall take care that the price of rejoicing
shall not, by dishonorable collusion, be wrung from the poor.
If this law should be violated by sacrilegious dissimulation, the person who
profits by what is collected shall be deprived of hisi reputa-5on andThis
fortune; the same penalty shall be imposed upon him who ejected the money, and
the officer who permitted it to be done shall be punished with a fine of thirty
pounds of gold.
2. This Law is Not Authentic.
