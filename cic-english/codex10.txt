THE CODE OF OUR LORD THE MOST HOLY EMPEROR JUSTINIAN.
SECOND EDITION. BBOOOOKK XX..
TITLE I. CONCERNING THE RIGHTS OF THE TREASURY.


1. The Emperor Alexander to Atticus and Severus.
If your father is proved to have made a legal donation of the land in question,
before he became indebted to the Treasury, the transaction will not be
rescinded, as it was not entered into for the purpose of defrauding creditors.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Serenius.
A computation made by accountants does not obtain the force of a legal
decision, unless it has been confirmed by the Attorney of the Treasury.
3. The Same Emperor to Attica.
If the property hypothecated to the Treasury was through manifest fraud or
favor sold to the purchaser for less than its value, the Attorney of the
Treasury, having been applied to, will order the land to be returned, after you
have tendered the payment of the amount which is due.
4. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian to Nicetus.
A positive rule has been formulated with reference to metroicians who have been
transferred to another city by order of the Emperor. For if the lands which
they possessed before they were compelled to move have not been sold, it was
long since decreed that they shall be forfeited to the Treasury, unless the
Emperor, by a special decree, has provided otherwise. As this salutary
regulation has been established by former emperors, with this exception, no law
has been passed preventing them from becoming the heirs of their parents.
5. Extract from the Imperial Epistles of the Same Emperors to Flaccus.
It has been forbidden to seize without Imperial authority the property of
anyone who is thought to be indebted to the Treasury. And that every precaution
may be taken to prevent Caesarians 1from doing so, We order that all the
parties in interest shall be permitted to resist by force those who attempt
without Our permission, to seize the property of anyone who has become subject
to penalty of the law, so that even if officers should venture to violate the
terms of the present decree, they can be prevented from committing injustice by
the resistance of private persons. For he whose interest it is that the
property of anyone should not be interfered with, when officers appear to seize
it, ought to acquiesce, provided they produce their authority, as he will
ascertain from Our letters, and not from the arbitrary acts of the Csesarians
(that is to say, the officers) whether they have the right to take the
property, and that the law has empowered this to be done.
6. The Emperor Constantine to the Inhabitants of the Provinces.
We order that all documents through which the Treasury acquires legal rights of
action shall be burned, if they have not been made use of during the time
prescribed by law; so that no unjust suits may be brought by private persons,
and the example which We have ordered to be given by disposing of legal causes
of action belonging to the Treasury in this manner may be followed.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of Constantine,
Consul for the fifth time, and the Caesar Licinius, 319.
7. The Same Emperor to Volusianus, Prefect of the City.
The right of defence is granted to those whose property can be interfered with
in any way by the Treasury, as it is not right that it should be occupied or
seized while an action is still pending. Therefore, when a controversy arises
through the Treasury claiming the property of anyone, the party in possession
of the same shall have power to avail himself of all suitable defences; and if
the result should
1 Csesaria-ns were executive officers charged with the collection of claims
belonging to the Imperial Treasury; Catholici were the Receivers-General oi a
district. --- ED.
establish the fact that the property should be confiscated, then it shall be
lawful for it to be seized, and an inquiry made to ascertain the amount of it,
which must be done by conditional slaves, so that if anything has been
abstracted, it may be recovered, and as much more be exacted by the imposition
of a fine as was fraudulently removed.
If, however, an official should be implicated in an offence of this kind, he
should not enjoy the benefit of the right of seizure granted by this law;
especially if the practice of fraud has-caused any of the officials aforesaid,
who are accustomed to rashly indulge in such practices, to be excluded.
8. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Dracontius, Vicegerent of Africa.
Those persons who, by means of fraudulent contracts, entered into for the
purpose of injuring the Treasury, have implicated themselves in criminal acts,
shall be required to refund fourfold the amount obtained.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof December, during the Consulate of
Valentinian and Valens, 365.
9. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Patricius, Count of Private Affairs.
We order that the decision of Your Highness concerning the responsibility of
the Stewards of the Imperial household for the appointment of collectors of Our
revenues shall be confirmed, so that all intriguing for office shall cease, and
that all the provisions enacted with a view to the maintenance or expenses of
the Imperial household which have been established and confirmed by ancient
custom, shall remain inviolate; and that the ancient practice relative to the
Irenarch and the Optio shall continue to be observed.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Theodosius, Consul for the ninth time, and Constantius, Consul for the second
time, 420.
10. The Same Emperors to Palladius, Praetorian Prefect of the East.
We decree that the estates of deceased persons who, during their lifetime, are
said to have been guilty of various crimes, shall, under no circumstances, be
confiscated to the Treasury, unless it should be established that they were
convicted of said crimes after having been publicly accused.
Given at Ravenna, on the eighth of the Idesof July, during the Consulate of
Eustachius and Agricola, 421.
11. This Law is not Authentic.
TITLE II.
CONCERNING SUITS BROUGHT AGAINST DEBTORS OF THE
TREASURY.
1. The Emperor Gordian to Saturninus and Others.
You are not unreasonable when you request that where the Treasury has a claim
against yourself and others, those debtors should be sued first who are
responsible for the balance due, and that recourse should afterwards be had to
you, who purchased certain property from them.
2. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus, and the Cazsar Valerian, to Erophilus.
The Treasury still has a right of action against you, even if it was stated in
the accounts that you paid the money due, if the registrar did not note the
receipt given to you for the same. It is, however, only just that power should
be given to sue the collector in order that the amount may be obtained from his
own property, if he is solvent, and the Treasury be indemnified, and afterwards
recourse can be had to you, if he should be unable to make payment.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian and the Cassars to Januarius and
Others.
As you allege that you are colleagues and associates of Augeriua and his son in
the collection of unpaid balances of taxes, and that they alone are charged
with the collection of other claims, and that the responsibility rests
principally upon them, and not upon them jointly with the others who were also
appointed collectors, and as you assert that since the persons being separate,
the responsibility should be divided, it is not contrary to law for the
Treasury to be indemnified out of the property of those who were first
designated to collect the unpaid taxes, and that afterwards those who appointed
them should be sued, if the entire indebtedness is not discharged.
Therefore, Our Receiver-General must observe the provisions of the law, that is
to say, he must first exhaust the property of the collectors, as well as of
those responsible for their appointment, and, if the Treasury should not obtain
enough for the payment of the entire indebtedness, it can also compel you to
pay whatever may still be due to it.
4. The Emperors Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian to Archelaus, Count of the
East.
Persons who are indebted to the Treasury shall, by all means, be held liable,
and be compelled to pay out of their individual property the debts which they
have contracted in their own names; and when they have done so, they will have
a right to collect from their debtors any valid claims which they may have
against them, in order that they may know that they can legally proceed against
those whom they assert are indebted to them.
Given on the third of the Nonesof July, during the Consulate of Our Prince
Valentinian, and Victor, 369.
5. The Same Emperors to Fortunatianus, Count of Private Affairs.
A memorandum which contained the names of debtors, or persons who have entered
into contracts with him, is said to have been found among the papers of a
person whose property was confiscated, but there was no proof either by
witnesses, or by any written evidence of indebtedness that the money had been
lent, as was stated in the memorandum; hence, We think that it would be unjust
for anyone to render another his debtor merely by a statement written by his
own hand. Therefore We desire by the present law to prevent the prosecution of
fraudulent claims by such means, so that the memorandum having been rejected as
without foundation, no one of those whose names were mentioned therein may be
compelled to make payment.
We order that this rule shall be observed in all similar cases.
Given at Hierapolis, on the day before the Nones ofJuly, during the Consulate
of Gratian, Consul for the fourth time, and Nerobaudus, 327.
TITLE III.
CONCERNING THE AUTHORITY OP AND THE RIGHTS CONFERRED BY SALES MADE AT AUCTION
BY THE TREASURY, AND CONCERNING BIDS.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Curtia.
State to My Attorney what you have set forth in your application, as your
request comes under his jurisdiction; and if you can prove to him that the sale
was not authorized by an agent, or by someone who had the right to do so, and
that the property was not sold at auction, nor disposed of in accordance with
the formalities required by law, if you pay what you owe under the judgment,
the sale which was contracted in bad faith must be rescinded, and you will
receive the property, together with the profits which fraudulently came into
the hands of the purchaser, or which it may be established ought to have come
into his hands.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Heracleo.
There are two reasons in favor of your claim: first, as you state your property
has been sold by public authority without having been offered at auction; and
second, because you allege that, through the Tow price paid on account of the
small amount of the debt, the sale was to the advantage of My Treasury and to
your loss; therefore, take steps to have these unlawful proceedings annulled as
much for the purpose of indemnifying the Treasury as to provide for your own
security.
3. The Same Emperors to Crispus.
If there are no written proofs of the sale in existence, and your wife can show
by any evidence that the house which you state she
bought from the Treasury in her own name is hers, and that she paid the price,
the ownership of the property transferred to her, My attorney will not permit
her to be annoyed by the Treasury, on the ground that the property belongs to
her mother.
4. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csssars, to Marcellina.
If the time prescribed by law with reference to sales made at auction by the
Treasury has not expired, as you state that you will pay more, apply to Our
Receiver, in order that he may accept your legal offer of a higher price.
5. The Emperors Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian to Viventius, Prsetorian
Prefect of the Gauls.
Property liable for unpaid taxes arising from the tribute of grain, or other
claims due to the Treasury, which should be sold at auction by the authority of
the latter, shall, no matter what the nature of the said property may be,
forever belong by the right of ownership to those to whom anything of this kind
has been regularly disposed of at public sale with the sanction of the
Treasury. And if a rescript should ever be obtained by anyone, for the purpose
of setting aside a sale of this kind made by the Treasury, it shall be null and
void; as where any of their property has been adjudged to purchasers on account
of fiscal indebtedness, even minors shall not have the power of recovering the
same at any age, by pleading their minority when the transaction
took place.
Given on the third of the Nonesof .November, during the Consulate of Our Noble
Prince Valentinian, and Victor, 369.
6. The Same Emperors to Felix, Count of the Sacred Largesses.
If anyone should buy property at a public sale made by the Treasury for the
payment of debts, he shall only be liable for the price of said property, which
it is apparent that he purchased at auction, after publication has been made,
for We protect such persons to the extent that We do not permit them to suffer
any loss, under the pretext that a balance due to the Treasury remains unpaid.
Given at Martianopolis, on the seventh of the Idesof March, during the
Consulate of Valentinian and Valens.
7. This Law is not Authentic.
TITLE IV.
CONCERNING THE SALE OF PROPERTY OWNED IN COMMON BY THE TREASURY AND PRIVATE
INDIVIDUALS.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Eupleus.
It is the rule that whenever property is held in common by the Treasury and
private persons, all of it shall be sold by My Attorney,
even though the smaller share belongs to the Treasury, but only the price of
the portion to which it is entitled shall be paid to the Treasury, and the
remainder shall be given to the joint-owner. Therefore, bring your action
against the purchaser of the lands mentioned in your petition, before the
proper judge, so that the former can set up the defences of which he has a
right to avail himself.
TITLE V. THE TREASURY CANNOT EVICT PROPERTY WHICH is SOLD.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Hermia.
Ideeply regret that the Treasury should call in question the payment that it
received, in consideration of which it transferred the property in good faith,
for it is only just that the purchaser should not be molested by having the
title disputed, or for any other reason; as in sales of this kind the officials
can settle their controversies without interfering with the purchaser.
2. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Palladius, Prse-torian Prefect.
The dictates of justice and honesty do not suffer the Treasury to rescind a
sale which it has once made.
TITLE VI.
CONCERNING THOSE WHO HAVE RECEIVED A LOAN OP MONEY PROM THE PUBLIC FUNDS.
1. The Emperors Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian to Probus, Prss-torian
Prefect.
If anyone should receive money as a loan bearing interest from collectors,
notaries, treasurers, or other officials, and is convicted, he shall, by the
authority of this law, be liable to the penalty of quadruple damages.
Given on the fourth of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Valentinian
and Valens, 365.
2. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Palladius, Pr&torian
Prefect.
All persons are hereby notified that no one is permitted to borrow money
belonging to the Imperial Treasury. Therefore, if anyone should, without Our
sanction, borrow money from Our Treasury for his private use, whether he does
so secretly, or after having furnished a bond or other security, for the
purpose of rendering himself a debtor, he shall be deprived of all his
property, and sentenced to perpetual deportation. He, also, who lends or gives
to anyone money out of the Treasury aforesaid, under the pretext of a public
loan, shall be condemned to death.
Given at Heraclia, on the twelfth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate
of Eucherius and Syagrius, 381.
TITLE VII.
'WHERE CREDITORS ARE REFERRED TO THE TREASURY WHEN PECUNIARY PENALTIES HAVE
BEEN PREFERRED.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Marcellus.
The collection of a penalty is postponed until other creditors have obtained
the settlement of their claims. Therefore, as, so far as the amount of the
claim is concerned, the Treasury has the preference, so the same rule should be
observed where triple damages are imposed by way of penalty, and added to the
original amount.
TITLE Vill. CONCERNING FISCAL INTEREST.
1. The Emperor Antoninus to Antigonus.
Interest cannot be collected on the sum which you can prove has been imposed
upon you by way of penalty, for My Attorney will not demand any more than the
fine which has been imposed, but he will order you to pay the penalty.
2. The Emperor Alexander to Victorinus.
Where the claim was secured by a pledge, the Treasury, which took the place of
the debtor, will be required to pay interest, if it was inserted in the
original contract that this should be done.
3. The Emperor Justinian to Menna, Prsstorian Prefect.
We order that the Treasury shall also obey the law which We have promulgated,
by which We permit creditors, with the exception of certain persons, to
stipulate for the payment of six per cent interest, so that the Treasury itself
cannot exact a higher rate than this from its debtors; whether they are
indebted to it in the first place, or whether rights of action have been
transferred to it by prior creditors in any way whatsoever.
TITLE IX.
CONCERNING THE REVOCATION OF DECISIONS RENDERED AGAINST THE TREASURY.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Acutianus.
It is a well-known rule of law that cases in which judgment is rendered against
the Treasury can be revoked within the three years next ensuing, and, even
after that time, if collusion should be established, or fraud clearly proved.
TTIITTLLEE XX..
CONCERNING PROPERTY WHICH HAS No OWNER, AND INCORPORATION.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian and the Caesars, to Euchiarius.
Your Highness should know that the property of persons dying intestate and
without leaving any lawful heirs is confiscated to Our Treasury,1 and that
municipalities which attempt to claim such property for themselves, on the
ground that they have permission to do so, ought not to be heard. Hence, if you
should afterwards ascertain that the property of persons dying intestate has
been seized by municipalities, under the pretext of certain privileges which
they enjoy, you will not hesitate to claim the said property for the benefit of
Our Treasury.
2. The Emperor Constantine to the Receiver ZEmilms.
If, when we make a donation of land or a house, in writing, and state that it
is given in its original condition, this expression signifies that it is
transferred with all its appurtenances; that is to say, with everything
belonging to it, including slaves, flocks, crops, and all rights attaching to
the property; so that whatever is necessary for the cultivation of the land, or
belongs to the house, may be embraced in the donation.
Given at Milan, on the sixth of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of
Constantine, Consul for the third time, and Licinius, 313.
3. The Emperors Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian to Florentius, Count of
Private Affairs.
Whenever any money is paid into Our Treasury as the result of confiscation, or
for any other lawful reason, it should be formally added to the funds of the
Empire, by the Count of Private Affairs, and a record of it made by the
receivers of the different provinces, and everything should be carefully set
forth in detail.
The written evidences of title by which lands become the property of Our
Treasury must be publicly attested, and those who, on their own authority,
attempt to appropriate anything for themselves from property of this
description, shall suffer the severest punishment.
Given on the fourth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of Our Prince
Valentinian, and Victor.
4. The Emperors Honorius, Theodosius, and Constantius to Pal-ladius, Prsetorian
Prefect.
We order that the property of persons who die intestate shall be transferred to
the Treasury, if the deceased left no blood-relative in the line of descent,
nor any lawful heir.
Given at Ravenna, on the eighth of the Idesof July, during the Consulate of
Eustatius and Agricola, 421.

5. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Hieritocrates, Count of Private
Affairs.
Where property has no owner, or where, for any other reason, the title to it
vests in the Treasury, certain Palatines should be chosen and sworn, so that,
at their instance, the Governor of the province, in the presence of the
Attorney for the Crown, can make diligent inquiry whose property it was that
has no owner, and has escheated to the State, and how much there is, as well as
what is the nature of the same; and if, after proper notice has been given, it
should appear that there is no one legally entitled either to hold said
property, or to claim it, it shall be forfeited to the Treasury, and this shall
be established by the report of the Governor, as well as by documents drawn up
for this purpose; and the inventory of said property shall be forwarded to Us,
so that by Our command, if there is no owner, or there is some other good
cause, it shall be placed at the disposal of the Treasury.
This rule shall be observed with reference either to a portion of the property
or all of it, and where there is one claim, or several. If any fraud has been
committed at the expense of the Treasury, the persons who have been appointed
and are responsible shall not escape punishment. The Governor shall be fined
half the amount of his possessions, and the Attorney of the Treasury shall be
compelled to make good any loss which the Treasury has sustained through his
fault.
Given at Constantinople, on the seventh of the Idesof October, during the
Consulate of Our Lord the Emperor Theodosius, Consul for the fifth time, and he
who may be appointed his colleague, 435.
TITLE XI. CONCERNING INFORMERS.
1. The Emperor Alexander to Haterins.
Where an implied trust has been left to someone who is entitled to receive it,
there is no ground for information, for property cannot be left tacitly to
those who have no right to receive it openly.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Nicontius.
The duties of your office require that you should, by all means, diligently
prosecute the case of which information has been given by another by order of
the Attorney of the Treasury, and the perusal of the documents which have been
inserted into the petition clearly indicates that you did not voluntarily act
as informer. Therefore, the illustrious Governor of the province will take
special care that you shall not be personally molested, which would be an act
contrary to the practice of My reign.
3. The Same Emperor to Clcelius.
Anyone who is alleged by officials to have in his possession land or buildings
belonging to the Treasury cannot be branded with the disgrace or crime of an
informer, who can show that not he, but another, is the possessor of the
property.
4. The Emperor Philip to Candidus.
From the consideration of various laws, the conclusion is arrived at that
persons who defend the interests of the government cannot be accused of being
informers, as it is well known to all persons that only those who denounce
others to the Treasury belong to that execrable class.
5. The Emperor Constantine to the Inhabitants of the Provinces.
We order all judges to exercise great diligence, in the punishment of informers
who denounce others without first making application to the Advocate of the
Treasury, for it is a perfectly clear rule of law that where the Treasury is
entitled to any property from an estate which has no owner, or by the law, that
it can only legally be claimed by advocates representing the Treasury. But for
the reason that some persons, acting hastily, do not hesitate to denounce
others as having possession of property belonging to the Treasury, those who
consider themselves injured can invoke the severity of the law which is
provided against informers.
Given at Constantinople, on the eleventh of the Kalendsof April, during the
Consulate of Constantius and Albinus.
6. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Pallius, Consular of
Lydia.
We order that a slave who informs against his master shall, as an example to
all traitors, be subjected to the severest punishment, even if he should prove
his accusation. The crime of high treason, however, is excepted in such cases.
Given at Constantinople, on the seventh of the Kalendsof November, during the
Consulate of Antony and Syagrius, 382.
7 and8. These Laws are not Authentic.
TITLE XII.
CONCERNING THE ABOLITION OF THE DEMAND FOR PROPERTY.
1. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Eutro-pius, Prsetorian
Prefect.
When anyone has been convicted of the crime of treason and punished, his
property shall be confiscated to the Treasury (as is customary in the expiation
of this offence) and let no one venture to claim the said property as his own
under the pretext that it has been given him by the Emperor. Anyone who plans
anything in opposition to this law shall be considered to have violated it. As
We, however, are in certain cases frequently constrained by the importunity of
petitioners to grant what should not be conceded, We decree that if anything
should be obtained by an Imperial Rescript contrary to the provisions of this
law, as enacted, it shall be void.
Moreover, if We desire to grant anything out of property of this kind, We shall
do so at Our own instance, and not in compliance with the request or demand of
anyone whomsoever; and a concession of this kind shall, alone, possess
validity.
Given at Thessalonica, on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof December, during the
Consulate of Gratian, Consul for the fifth time, and Theodosius, 380.
2. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Florentius, Pras-torian Prefect.
As We desire to eradicate every pretext for seizing the fortunes of others, We
decree that hereafter no one shall have a right to claim such property. If any
person of either sex should die intestate, and leave no relatives, or a wife or
a husband, no matter what his or her status may be, nor to what sect he or she
may belong, nor under what title the estate may revert to the Treasury, let no
one dare to demand the property of said deceased person, no matter to what rank
or sect he or she may belong, if Our Treasury has a legal right to the same; as
it is not proper even for those who have authority to act by reason of their
official positions to violate Our laws with impunity. If the illustrious
Qusestor should, at any time, grant a petition presented to him for this
purpose, or should give a favorable answer to it, or if the illustrious Count
of Private Affairs should permit a petition to be drawn up, or authorize what
is included therein, he shall be punished and his rashness made an example to
others.
Again, We decree that those who draw up such papers for the purpose of
obtaining rescripts of this kind, or which have in view their enforcement
shall, as well as the Palatines who granted the prayers of the petitions or
were instrumental in their execution, be punished with confiscation. We decree
that, in like manner, property belonging to the State shall not be made the
subject of any petition, and that no pragmatic order, or Imperial note or any
other response proceeding from the throne, or any mandate obtained in violation
of this Our law, shall hereafter have any force or effect.
TITLE XIII. CONCERNING THOSE WHO DENOUNCE THEMSELVES.
1. The Emperor Constantine to Maximus.
If he to whom an estate has been tacitly left by a trust should immediately
communicate the fact to Your Highness, produce the documents establishing the
fact, and at once renounce all claim to the trust, he shall receive the third
part of the entire estate of the deceased as a reward for his good faith.
When a communication of this kind is made to you by the widow of the deceased,
and documentary evidence shows that the latter intended that she should be his
heir, she will be entitled to half of the estate by way of recompense, and it
shall be equally divided between herself
and the Treasury. She shall also have the privilege of the first choice of the
property, and the person who was guilty of the fraud, and was the enemy of both
the Treasury and the woman, shall be deprived of all his possessions, which
shall be confiscated to the Treasury, and he shall be deported to an island.
Given during the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Gallicanus and Bassus,
317.
TITLE XIV.
WHERE A JOINT OWNER OF PROPERTY DONATED BY THE EMPEROR DIES WITHOUT HEIRS.
1. The Emperor Constantine to Mygdonius, Marshal of the Palace.
We order that if anyone of those to whom any property has been given by Us
should die without leaving an heir, his share of the same shall, by way of
consolation, pass to his associate, rather than to any other person.
TITLE XV.
CONCERNING TREASURE TROVE. 1. The Emperor Leo to Erythrius, Praetorian Prefect.
Let no one hereafter annoy Us with petitions having reference to treasure found
either by himself or by someone else upon his own land or upon that of another,
for We give full power to everyone to seek for treasure on his own premises,
provided he does so without the practice of wicked arts and sacrifices
punishable by law, or by any other prohibited means (that is to say, where the
treasure has been hidden for a long time by the owners, who are unknown), and
having found the same, to make use of it. This manifestation of Our liberality
has been conceded in order that hereafter no malicious prosecution may be
instituted against those who have experienced the kindness of the Deity, as it
would be superfluous to request by a petition what has already been granted by
law, and the generosity of the Emperor.
Moreover, let no one dare to seek for hidden treasure for himself on the land
of others, without their consent, and especially where they are unwilling, and
do not know that this is being done. Where anyone thinks that an application
should be made to Us on this subject, or he has been found to have sought for
treasure on the premises of others, contrary to the provisions of this law, he
shall be compelled to surrender it to the owner of the land, and be punished as
a violator of this most salutary decree. If, however, he should find any
treasure on the land of another, while plowing or cultivating the same, or
under any other circumstances, without having had the design of searching for
it, he shall have the right to retain half of what he finds, and must restore
the other half to the owner of the land, and in this way each one will enjoy
what he is entitled to, and will not covet what belongs to others.
TITLE XVI.
CONCERNING TRIBUTES PAYABLE IN GRAIN AND MONEY.
1. This Law is not Authentic.
2. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus to Alienus.
An heir will be liable for the debts of the estate in proportion to his share
of the same, but the tribute of grain is absolutely payable by the person who
is in possession of the land, and gathers the crops.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Caesars, to Herennius.
Taxes are ordinarily imposed not on persons, but on property; and therefore the
Governor of the province will see that you are not compelled to pay more than
the value of your possessions demands.
4. The Emperor Constantine to Proculiamts.
All persons should be familiar with the amount of taxes which We have imposed,
and with the fact that no one has any power to collect more or less than that
amount. For if any vicegerent or Governor of a province should think that
someone ought to be released from the payment of any portion of his tax, that
from which he released another, he shall be forced to pay out of his own
property.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof July, during the
fourth Consulate of Constantine and Licinius, 315.
5. The Emperor Constantine to Uranius.
All persons should be compelled to pay their share of the public obligations,
for, by the law which We have promulgated, the taxes which We have imposed upon
Our beloved inhabitants of provinces are not extraordinary, and should not be
so designated.
Given on the third of the Nonesof February, during the Consulate of
Constantius, Consul for the second time, and Constans, 339.
6. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Dracontius, Vicegerent of Africa.
We order that tributes consisting of grain shall be transported to the
frontiers, when the places where they are situated and the proximity of the
land permit this to be done.
Given at Milan, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of
Valentinian and Valens, 365.
7. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Princi~ pius,
Prsetorian Prefect.
It is clear that a rescript obtained for the purpose of defrauding the public
by evading the tribute of grain can have no legal force. Therefore the
imposition of this tax shall affect all persons in the same manner.
Given at Aquileia, on the eighth of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate
of Arcadius and Bauto, 385.
8. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Cyne-giuSf Praetorian
Prefect.
No owner of land shall have an excessive tax for the construction of buildings
or the transport of grain imposed upon him, but all shall bear the burden
equally, the distance and requirements of transportation having been duly taken
into account.
Given at Constantinople, on the tenth of the Kalendsof January, during the
Consulate of Arcadius and Bauto,.385.
9. The Same Emperors to Cynegius, Prsetorian Prefect.
The inland cities had formerly burdens imposed upon them by those situated on
the sea, and vice versa,so that they were subjected to more expense than the
amount of the tax. By the present law We forbid this to occur both now and
hereafter, and those who commit such acts are notified that they will be
punished with death.
Given at Valentia, on the third of the Nonesof September, during the Consulate
of Our Prince Honorius, and Evodius, 386.
10. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Minervius, Count of Private Affairs.
The privileges of rank cannot interfere with the public welfare, or the
requirements imposed by law; therefore, where anyone is entitled to the use of
land, and has not paid his taxes within the term of a year, nor during the
following six months, the person to whom he is said to be bound will be
compelled to pay whatever is due; and We desire this to apply to those who are
the owners of the property.
Published during the Consulate of Honorius, Consul for the fourth time, and
Eutychianus, 398.
11. The Same Emperors to Eutychianus, Prsetorian Prefect.
Judges who are negligent with reference to the claims of Our Treasury, and are
proved to have been careless in this respect shall be compelled to surrender
all the emoluments which they have acquired during their term of office.
12. The Emperors Theododius to Isidore, Prsetorian Prefect of lllyria.
We decree that only the amount shall be collected in every province which Your
Highness stated has recently been promised by each. No appraiser shall,
hereafter, be appointed for the valuation of land (which the inhabitants of the
provinces especially dread).
The remainder of the provinces shall not follow the example of the Macedonians,
and only half of the amount of the tribute, which they are known to have
offered, be collected. Those, however, who can show that no more than the third
part of what they owe can be raised by them, shall pay the same; after which
they may be released, so far as the remainder is concerned.
This rule shall always be observed hereafter, but is not applicable to the Holy
Church of the City of Thessalonica, which is notified that,
through Our indulgence, it is released from the payment of all taxes, and that
the State should not be injured by the exemption of private individuals from
the payment of tribute through the abuse of the name of the Church.
Given at Constantinople, on the sixth of the Idesof October, during the fifth
Consulate of Victor, 424.
13. This Law is not Authentic.
TITLE XVII. CONCERNING ADDITIONAL TAXES.
1. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Palladius, Prsetorian Prefect.
All persons, who are in possession of land under any title whatsoever, upon
which land a supplementary tax has been imposed, shall be compelled to pay the
same, as in the case of ordinary taxes. And in order that no doubt may arise on
this point, We hereby decree that a tax of this kind shall be considered an
ordinary one. Therefore no house either owned by the Crown, held under the
right of emphyteusis, or belonging to a private individual (even if it should
be shown to enjoy such a privilege) shall be released from the necessity of
payment of such a tax which shall not now, as heretofore, be considered
extraordinary, but by the terms of this law shall be deemed an ordinary one.
Given at Ravenna, on the seventh of the Idesof January, during the Consulate of
Theodosius, Consul for the seventh time, and Palladius, 417.
2. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Darius, Prsetorian Prefect.
Your Highness should indicate, by a regular notice despatched to the different
provinces, the amount of taxation to which each province is liable, before the
payment of the same becomes due, so that the owners of land may know in advance
what they will be required to pay, and not be taken unawares, no additional
expense be imposed upon the people of the province, and the exertion of
unlawful severity by officials charged with the collection of taxes be avoided.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of Isidore
and Senator, 436.
TITLE XVIII. CONCERNING SUPPLEMENTARY TAXES.
1. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to the Proconsuls, and all
Governors of Provinces.
No inhabitants of a province shall, in obedience to the written commands of the
Prefect, be compelled to pay any supplementary tax,
or any kind of tax whatsoever, unless the order has been confirmed by Us, and
strengthened by the Imperial authority, after which it may be imposed and
collected.
Given at Milan, on the seventh of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of
Antony and Syagrius, 382.
TITLE XIX. CONCERNING THE COLLECTORS OF TRIBUTE.
1. The Emperor Constantine.
The Ducenarii, Centenarii,and Sexagenariishould not attempt to collect the tax
due from debtors before having received complete lists of the said debtors, and
the amounts they owe from the Registrar of the City. The collection should be
made without any peculation.
Given during the Kalendsof November, during the fourth Consulate of Constantine
and Licinius, 315.
2. The Same Emperor to the People.
Let no one apprehend being placed in prison, whipped with leaded scourges,
tortured with weights, or subjected to any other punishment by perverse or
angry judges, for having been delinquent in the payment of taxes. Imprisonment
should only be inflicted upon those who are guilty, and judges and their
subordinate officials should be aware of this fact, and if they violate this
law shall be branded with infamy. Persons liable to the payment of taxes can,
with safety to themselves, appear before the Governor; or, if anyone should be
so destitute of human feeling as to abuse Our indulgence by being guilty of
obstinacy, he shall be confined in a military prison which is open, healthy,
and fitted for the occupation of men. If he should continue in his perverse
wickedness, the collector shall seize all his property, and make payment of the
taxes out of the same.
We believe that by granting this power to collectors, all persons will be more
inclined to the payment of those contributions which are demanded by the common
welfare for the use of Our army.
Given on the Kalendsof February, during the Consulship of Constantine, Consul
for the sixth time, and the Csesar Constantius, 320.
3. The Emperor Constantine to Nemesianus, Count of the Imperial Largesses.
Anyone who is ascertained to be indebted both to a private person and to the
Treasury, and has been arrested by an officer, shall be required to discharge
the entire debt; and anyone who rescues him shall be punished, and himself be
compelled to pay all that is due, if he is proved to have seized and removed
the said debtor.
Given at Nisibis, on the fourth of the Idesof May, during the Consulate of
Amantius and Albinus, 345.
4. The Same Emperor to Eustachius, Praetorian Prefect.The stewards and other
officers of Our private affairs can, when necessity demands it, be compelled by
the authority of the law to pay
any legal indebtedness in order that immunity from contribution to Our private
purse may not be imposed solely upon the people of the provinces.
Given at Rome, on the eighth of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of
Liminius and Catulinus, 349.
5. The Emperors Theodosius, Arcadius, and Honorius to Rufinus, Prsetorian
Prefect.
Those whose duty it is to collect taxes must state in writing the amount due,
and make a memorandum of their receipts, so that by this means the officials
may ascertain what has been collected> and what has been omitted; and the
receiver may not be compelled to undertake a long journey, and be absent from
his curia,and his private business suffer in consequence.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Idesof April, during the
Consulate of Theodosius, Consul for the third time, and Abundan-tius, 393.
6. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius.
Where debts are due to the Treasury, that is to say, contributions of grain and
other things which should be delivered at the Prefecture, as well as those
which require the services of Registers, the Governors of the provinces shall
be liable for the same, as they are required to provide for their collection,
and their authority must be exerted for that purpose.
7. The Same Emperors.
The opinators,that is to say, the collectors of military contributions,
together with the appointed judges and the subordinate officers of the latter,
are obliged to collect what is due within the term of a year. There is nothing
in common between them and the party in possession, for the latter must not
proceed against the soldier, but against the collector, if he is responsible.
Therefore, judges who permit the people of the province to be annoyed by
opinatorsare liable to the penalty of double the amount involved; and the
attendants of any official shall be liable to the sentence of deportation, if
they delegate to soldiers collections which should be made by themselves, and
members of the curiashall be condemned to temporary exile, if they think that
collections which they are required by law to make can be entrusted to
opinators.
The judge must decide who the debtors are, and see that their names are
carefully inscribed upon the registers, and that the officials, or members of
the curia,in compliance with the custom of the neighborhood, obtain from the
debtors the amounts of their assessments, so that, the taxes having been
collected, the opinatorsmay, at the end of the year, be able to rejoin the
divisions of the army to which they belong. When the collection is protracted
beyond the term of a year, the judges and their subordinate officials shall be
compelled to make up the deficiency to the soldiers without delay, and they
themselves shall be entitled to recourse against the persons Liable to the
payment
of the taxes. In case complaint is made to Us that the military collectors did
not make their returns within the prescribed time, double damages shall be
immediately collected from them, half of which shall be paid to the soldiers,
and the other half to the Treasury. For the purpose of aiding judges and their
officials, We permit them to employ all the authority of their offices against
obstinate debtors, without reward to their rank. If payment is delayed without
any good reason, recourse can be had to the stewards and agents, and their
land, and their names must also be communicated to Us.
Given on the third of the Idesof July, during the Consulate of Vicentius and
Fravittus, 401.
8. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian.
If the household of the Emperor, or indeed that of any other person, no matter
what his rank or fortune, actually possesses lands outside the principal town
of the district, which were not acquired through patronage, but by sale or any
other title whatsoever, and taxes imposed upon them by the State, and for which
the former owner was liable are not paid, the said lands shall be confiscated,
and assigned to the curiaof the city to whose jurisdiction they are subject.
It has appeared to Us advisable to provide for the public welfare and the
collection of the taxes to which the State is entitled by the enactment of this
law.
9. This Law is not Authentic.
TITLE XX. CONCERNING ILLEGAL COLLECTIONS.
1. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Apollodorus, Proconsul of Africa.
Where any sum over and above what is due has been exacted by officials of the
curia,their subordinates, or any other collectors, they shall be required to
surrender double the amount received, which shall, at once, be refunded to the
persons who paid it.
Where any collector is convicted of the crime of extortion, his avarice shall
be punished with death, if he should commit the offence a second time, after
having once been forbidden to do so.
Given on the day before the Idesof March, during the Consulate of Stilicho and
Aurelian, 400.
TITLE XXI.
CONCERNING THE SEIZURE AND SALE OF PROPERTY FOR THE PAYMENT OF TAXES.
1. The Emperor Constantine to the Africans.
The property of those who, through obstinacy, refused to pay what is due from
them to the Treasury, shall be sold, and the right of possession for the future
shall be fully assured to the purchasers.
Given on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of the
Cffisar Constantine, Consul for the fifth time, and Maximus, 327.
2. The Same Emperor.
It is sufficient for a debtor to be compelled to pay his tribute of grain, by
means of the seizure of his property.
Given on the eighth of the Idesof December, during the Consulate of
Constantius, Consul for the seventh time, and Constans, Consul for the third
time, 354.
TITLE XXII.
CONCERNING PUBLIC RECEIPTS, CURIAL SURVEYS OF LANDS, AND CIVIL APPOINTMENTS OF
TAXES.
1. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Anthemius.
For the purpose of exalting the fortunes of decurions that are of inferior
rank, and to repress the encroachments of others who are more powerful, as well
as to keep both classes under control, it has been decided that the official
valuations of property, which are required to be made under various
circumstances among the different orders of the people, shall not be carried
into execution before having been submitted to the Governors of provinces, and
approved in accordance with their decisions.
The money collected from contributions of this kind must be certified for by
the Receiver of the Treasury, and the receipt must contain the date, the name
of the consul, the month, the description of the land, and the amount, in which
way the nature of the property, as well as the justice of the tax, may appear,
and be established by documentary evidence.
The rule shall also be observed that, at the end of every four months, the
reports formally submitted to Your Excellency must include a detailed statement
of what has been collected, as well as of any balance due; so that all persons
who stand in awe of your authority may not venture to attempt anything for the
relief of the wealthy, or the oppression of the poor.
It is proper for this law to be obeyed, since the property of the opulent is
derived from the resources of the curia,as well as for the reason that both the
poor and the rich may reap the same benefit.
If any judge, accountant, or decurion should think that he can violate this
law, he shall be punished as Our authority may decide.
Given at Constantinople, on the seventh of the Kalendsof September, during the
fifth Consulate of Varanus.
2. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Celer, Proconsul of Africa.
Where a receipt has once been issued for the payment of taxes, the person to
whom it was given shall not be annoyed by another official. Therefore, Your
Excellency, having complied with the pro-
visions of this most salutary and equitable law, will hereafter prohibit those
who it is clear have obtained a receipt, and hence are not liable, from being
again compelled to discuss a transaction which has already been concluded.
Given at Ravenna, on the fifth of the Kalendsof May, after the fifth Consulate
of Felix and Taurus, 429.
3. The Emperor Martian to Constantine, Pr&torian Prefect.
Any inhabitant of the provinces and taxpayer who can prove payment of his tax,
after the expiration of a certain number of years, that is to say, if he can
produce receipts for three successive years, shall not be required to produce
any for those which precede this time; nor can he be compelled to make payment
of taxes for the time which has passed, unless either a decurion or some
subordinate official, deputy, accountant, or collector of public debts holds a
bond executed by the possessor of the property, or taxpayer; or if it should be
evident from the facts in the case that what he claims, that is to say, the
taxes for the time antedating the three years prescribed by law, are due to
him.
4. The Emperor Justinian.
We do not, under any circumstances, permit an exception on the ground that the
money was not paid to be pleaded against receipts signed by public officials,
evidencing the payment of either the entire amount, or a portion of the same.
TITLE XXIII.
CONCERNING THE LAW RELATING TO TAXES DUE TO THE FUND OF THE IMPERIAL LARGESSES.
1. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Julianus.
We order that the entire quantity of gold, silver, and other contributions
which it is customary to pay into the Treasury of the Imperial Largesses shall,
immediately after it has been collected, be turned over to the treasurer of
each province, or to the one nearest at hand, under the seals of the Registrar
and those whose duty it is to do so, as prescribed by former laws; and We order
those having charge of the Treasury to deliver the amount intact to the Count
of Private Affairs.
2. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Anthemius, Prse-torian Prefect.
The officers of the palace who have charge of the Imperial Largesses, as well
as the private purse of the Emperor, when they are sent into a province, shall
not, on their own authority, presume to institute legal proceedings against
possessors of property, for any cause whatsoever, or under any pretext of a
debt due to the Treasury,
whether any balance of unpaid taxes remains, or whether those of the present
time are payable; but the Governor of the province, having been applied to, may
compel this to be done, and may charge his subordinates with the performance of
this duty.
When, however, the Governor endeavors to avoid the trouble of complying with
the notices served upon him for this purpose; or, for any other reason, by his
own authority, transfers the charge of collecting the taxes to the said
officials of the palace, he himself, as well as his subordinate officers, shall
pay a fine of twenty pounds of gold to the Treasury.
Given at Constantinople, on the seventh of the Idesof December, during the
Consulate of Bassus and Philip, 408.
3. The Emperor Leo.
We decree that the secretaries attached to the subordinate officials of each
province for the purpose of keeping an account of their transactions shall not
be required to travel rapidly from one place to another, nor be subjected to
any other charge contrary to long continued custom; and they are also forbidden
to do this by the authority of the Prefect, so that, being freed from these
requirements, they may with more fidelity discharge their duties with reference
to largesses. If, at any time, this law should be rashly violated, then the
Governor of the province, as well as his subordinate officers, shall be
punished with a fine of thirty pounds of gold.
Moreover, the illustrious Count of the East and his subordinates shall have
power to restrain the illegal acts not only of the Governors, but also'of the
other officials, when information concerning them has been communicated to him
by the Palatines, and they will be liable to the same penalty if they do not,
under all circumstances, see that Our decrees are carried into effect.
(1) We hereby order that, in all the provinces, the appointment of special
collectors for the Treasury of the Largesses, as well as for the defence of the
secretaries, shall not only be made by the illustrious Governors of the
provinces, but also by the distinguished Proconsuls, or the Augustal Prefects,
and Vicegerents, together with their officers, whenever required, and notified
by the Palatines.
This having been done, after the appointment of the special collectors for the
Treasury of the Largesses, neither the Governors of provinces nor their
subordinates, nor the decurions, shall be permitted to remove any of the sums
collected which belong to the Imperial Treasury, or which should be transferred
to the provincial treasurers, or to any other fund than that to which it
belongs. Every four months, reports must be made by the proper accountant of
the amounts collected and appearing on the public registers, to be transmitted
to the capital of the Empire, on the responsibility of the Governor of the
province. The judges themselves, as well as their subordinates, are hereby
notified that they will be subjected to the penalty above mentioned, if the
present law, which We have promulgated, should not be observed in every
respect.
4. The Same Emperor.
We order that if the levy issued by the Prefecture to the different provinces
every year, according to custom, should fail to provide for the taxes payable
to the Treasury of the Largesses, or for some reason the collection of said
taxes should not take place, the illustrious Proconsuls as well as the
Vicegerents and the distinguished Count of the East, the Augustal Prefect, the
Governors of provinces and their subordinates, together with the decurions,
shall have authority to make the collection, and they must constantly bear in
mind that they will be liable to a fine of twenty pounds of gold if anything
less than what ancient and long-continued custom has established as due to the
fund of the Imperial Largesses should be collected or paid into the Imperial
Treasury.
TITLE XXIV. No LABOR SHALL BE REQUIRED OF TAXPAYERS.
1. The Emperors Valens, Gratia/n, and Valentinian to Viventius, Praetorian

Given on the tenth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Our Prince
Valentinian, and Victor, 369.

ONE.
1. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to the People.
Under the terms of the present Edict, the accountants of municipalities shall
be subjected to punishment by fire, if they, induced either by fraud, bribery,
or the exertion of power, afford anyone unlawful immunity from taxation.
All special exemptions not included in the preceding provisions are hereby
absolutely abolished, and the necessity for the payment of taxes, when
confirmed by the judges of the provinces and the officials having charge of the
same, is hereby imposed upon all persons.
Given at Milan, on the third of the Nonesof March, during the Consulate of
Merobaudus, Consul for the second time, and Saturninus, 383.

Owners of property in Bithynia and other provinces shall be compelled to pay

known to possess.

CONCERNING PROPERTY STORED IN PUBLIC WAREHOUSES.
1. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Volusianus, Prefect of the City.
We desire all articles stored in public warehouses to be used in such a way
that what is brought from your prefecture shall not be placed in the warehouses
until the grain now there has been exhausted, and if a portion of the latter
should be found to be spoiled, so that it cannot be used without complaint,
some of what is new shall be mixed with it, in such a way that what has been
damaged may be concealed by the addition, and the Treasury sustain no loss. You
should, according to your discretion and judgment, select a man for this duty
who is of high character, prudent, and faithful, and by all means conscious of
his own integrity, by whom a guard must be appointed, as well as an inspector
who shall either measure the grain, or make a correct estimate of the amount
stored in the warehouse.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof April, during the Consulate of the Divine
Jovian, and Varronianus, 364.
2. The Same Emperors and Gratian.
We desire that whenever you go to a city or a military post, you at once
inspect the public warehouses, in order that provisions of excellent quality
may be furnished Our devoted soldiers; for if through your neglect of the
duties of your office, and the bad condition of the roofs of 'the buildings,
any of the provisions should be spoiled by rain, you will be responsible for
the damage.
3. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Anatolius, Prsetorian Prefect of
Illyria.
No one, hereafter, shall have the right to touch government property stored in
warehouses, for if any person should be so rash as to dare to appropriate for
himself any of the property aforesaid, he is hereby notified that he will be
liable to the penalty of deportation, which has been prescribed by Us, and will
be compelled to suffer the loss of all his property.
Given at Constantinople, on the seventh of the Idesof July, during the
Consulate of Csesarius and Atticus, 397.
TITLE XXVII.
No ONE SHALL BE PERMITTED TO REFUSE TO SELL PROPERTY, AND CONCERNING THE DUTY
OF MAKING PURCHASES FOR THE PUBLIC BENEFIT.
1. The Emperor Anastasius.
We decree that when, through urgent necessity, purchases of wheat, barley, or
other grain take place in any province whatsoever,
no owner of said property shall, under the pretext of any privilege whatsoever,
have the right to refuse to sell it, and that in accordance with the terms of
this, Our most salutary law, permission shall never be given to the possessor
of such articles in any way or at any time, to avail himself of any rescript,
pragmatic sanction, or judicial decree, by which he may claim immunity.
Therefore We desire that these burdens shall be imposed upon all persons in
proportion to the allotment of each, and We do not allow even Our own
household, or that of Our Most Serene Consort, to be exempt from this
obligation.
2 and3. These Laws are not Authentic.
TITLE XXVIII.
CONCERNING THE COLLECTION OF TAXES ON DONATIONS
AND CONCEENING TRIBUTES AND PROPERTY CHARGED
WITH PAYMENTS IN KIND.
1. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Her-mocrites,
Praetorian Prefect.
We decree that the regulation of Antiochus of distinguished memory, which
levied a certain tax on tributary property in the name of the law, shall not be
repealed. For as this became a part of the law, and was required to be paid
every year, We do not permit anyone to be exempt from it, either in the past,
or in the future.
We desire that the rule above mentioned shall be observed, not only with
reference to past time, but also with reference to that which is to come, and
with respect to tributary property, as well as such as has been donated by the
Emperor, along with any charged with the payment of tribute in kind, or whose
nature has been changed, or which passes under some new designation, and that
no trouble need ever be anticipated on account of the imposition of additional
charges.
We not only relax the rule with reference to the past, but decree that nothing
new and no increase of the burden shall be ordered in the future, and that,
hereafter, no one shall be permitted to have hiis property exempt in opposition
to the Imperial Decrees. Your Highness is advised that if, at any time, a
rescript contrary to the present law should be sent to you with Our sanction,
or if you should'obey any Imperial Mandate (even if one should emanate from Us)
which is contrary to the provisions of this law, or anyone should think that
debtors ought to be exposed to a hardship of this kind, he is hereby notified
that he will be liable to a fine of two hundred pounds of gold.
TITLE XXIX. CONCERNING THE PAYMENT OF TAXATION IN COPPER.
1. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Hilarius.
We consent that the payment of taxes in copper, which is collected from the
inhabitants of certain provinces, may be made in gold, so
that one solidusof gold may be paid by the owner of the property instead of
twenty pounds of copper. .
Given at Milan, on the fifth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Arcadius, Consul for the fourth time, and Honorius, Consul for the third time,
396.
TITLE XXXXXX..CONCERNING ASSESSORS.
1. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to An-themius, Vicegerent
of the Spains.
Whenever it is established that property has been unjustly appraised, and the
assessor cannot give a good and sufficient reason for the estimate which he
made, he himself shall immediately be compelled to make good the loss, to which
he wrongfully subjected the debtor.
Given on the day before the Idesof May, during the Consulate of Our Prince
Valentinian, and Victor, 369.
2. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Messala, Prsstorian Prefect.
In order to prevent extortion being practiced against persons liable to
taxation, because of the loss of their receipts, We decree that when receipts
have been mentioned in the public records as having been given either by
assessors or other officials, the sums paid cannot again be unjustly demanded.
Given at Milan, on the fifth of the. Kalendsof December, during the Consulate
of Stilicho and Aurelian, 400.
3. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian.
We decree that in all provinces and cities, no persons, including members of
Our Consistory, soldiers, and advocates, whether they are in practice or not,
or belong to the provincial bar, shall be exempt from the performance of their
official duties, so far as the appraisement of property is concerned.
4. This Law is not Authentic.
TITLE XXXI.
CONCERNING DECURIONS AND THEIR SONS WHO ARE CONSIDERED DECURIONS, AND IN WHAT
WAYS THEY MAY BE RELEASED FROM THE DUTIES OF THE DECU-
RIONATE.
1. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus.
If, in accordance with the wishes of your father, the office of de-curion was
conferred upon you during his lifetime, his heirs will be liable to the State,
for, in this instance, your father is considered to
act as surety for you, but recourse cannot be had to him until after your
property has been exhausted.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximum.
It is necessary for the magistrates, after having formally summoned the
decurions to their place of meeting, to appoint them to their several
employments, and, by means of a public officer to notify each one of them of
the duty which he is to perform, and for which he was appointed; and he will
have the right to appeal if he desires to do so, and present his case before
the Governor of the province in the usual way. If the latter should decide that
the appointment ought not to have been made, the expenses of litigation must be
refunded to the plaintiff by the official responsible for it.
3. The Same Emperors and Ctesars.
As you voluntarily accepted the office of the decurionate, you cannot be
released, even though you state that you are advanced in years.
4. The Same Emperors and Csesars.
As there is no doubt that an adoptive son himself becomes a de-curion on
account of the office of his adoptive father, it is not proper that you should
be guilty of atrocious cruelty to one whom you have accepted in the place of
natural offspring; nor can unlawful bodily torture be inflicted upon him by the
Governor of the province, but he should be punished by the imposition of a
suitable penalty.
5. The Same Emperors and Caesars.
You have been incorrectly informed that sons who are under paternal control can
be called to the performance of official duties. Still, if you did not give
your consent to the appointment of your son, you cannot be held liable for his
administration.
6. The Same Emperors and Csesars.
The laws do not prohibit even illiterate persons from discharging the duties of
decurions.
7. The Same Emperors and Csesars.
Although brothers have an undivided interest in their property, each one will,
nevertheless, be individually responsible for the discharge of his official
duties.
8. The Same Emperors and Csesars.
Infamy, which should be shunned by you, will deprive you of the office that you
have obtained, which the loss of your eyesight will not do.
9. The Same Emperors and Csesars.
It is established that, among decurions, a father will take precedence over
those who have no children.
10. The Same Emperors and Csesars.
If the Governor of the province should find that your father is more than
seventy years of age, he will see that he enjoys exemption from personal
service in office.
11. The Same Emperors and Csesars.
There is no doubt that a wife cannot be held responsible for the obligations of
her husband, as decurion.
12. The Same Emperors and Csesars.
It is settled that anyone branded with infamy is not entitled to immunity, as
this privilege only attaches to persons of unblemished character.
13. The Same Emperors and Csesars.
Neither the decurions of a Governor, the age of fifty years, nor the gout,
affords a valid excuse for exemption from the duties of the decurionate.
14. The Emperor Constantine to Evagrius.
No judge shall, on his own responsibility, release a man from the office of
decurion; for if anyone should be so unfortunate as to deserve relief, his case
must be referred to Us, so that he may be relieved from his official duties for
a certain time.
Published on the Idesof March, during the third Consulate of Constantine and
Licinius, 313.
15. The Same Emperor to Mechilius Hilarian.
We wish all decurions to refrain from exercising the functions of
notaries.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of Sabinus
and Rufinus, 316.
16. The Same Emperor to Hilarian, Proconsul of Africa.
If any decurion should, either on account of his own affairs, or of those of
the State, be compelled to appear before Our Council, he shall not leave before
communicating to the presiding judge the reason for his journey, and obtaining
his permission to depart. If anyone should be so audacious as to disregard this
law, he shall undergo suitable punishment for his act.
Published at Carthage, on the sixth of the Idesof July, during the third
Consulate of Crispus and Constantine, 324.
17. The Same Emperor to Evagrius, Praetorian Prefect.
Anyone who abandons the office of decurionate to enlist in the army shall be
recalled to his curia.
Given on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate of
Constantine, Consul for the second time, and the Caesar Con-stantius, 326.
18. The Same Emperor.
Where anyone appointed to the magistracy takes to flight, and, while sought
for, obstinately remains concealed, his property shall be given to those who at
that time are called to perform in his place the functions of the duumvirate,
so that if he should afterwards be found, he may be compelled to act as duumvir
for two years. All persons who refuse to discharge their public duties shall be
liable under the same rule.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof October, during the Consulate of
Constantine, Consul for the ninth time, and Constantius, Consul for the fourth
time, 326.
19. The Same Emperor to Lucretius Paternus.
Having annulled the rescripts by which exemption from the duties of civil
office is conceded to all, persons are hereby subjected to the discharge of
these civil duties, so that no release will be valid, even if granted with the
consent of the people or the curia,but all citizens are required to perform
their civil obligations.
Given at Heraclia, on the eighth of the Kalendsof November, during the
Consulate of Constantine, Consul for the eighth time, and Constantius, Consul
for the fourth time, 326.
20. The Emperors Constantius and Constans to the Decurions of the City of
Constantine.
Your Highness must require the magistrates of the City of the Cyreneians who
have abandoned their places to return, and they shall immediately be required
to refund in full any expense incurred by the City on their account.
Given on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of
Acyndinus and Proculus, 340.
21. The Same Emperors to Count Nemesianus.
The decurions of all cities should suffer no anxiety on account of property
belonging to Our private domain, nor should they be subjected to any
extraordinary burdens of this kind, as it will be sufficient if they properly
discharge duties of their office.
Given on the day before the Idesof August, during the Consulate of Acyndinus
and Proculus, 340.
22. The Emperor Julian to Julian, Count of the East.
Former Emperors permitted children born of mothers whose families are connected
with the decurionate to belong to the curiaof Antioch, when the status of their
fathers did not entitle them to any such privilege.
Given at Antioch, on the fifth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate
of Mamertinus and Nevitta, 362.
23. The Same Emperor to Julian, Count of the East.Provision should be made to
prevent those who have only recently been appointed to the Order of Decurionate
from being burdened with
the debts of their predecessors, for those who have previously contracted such
obligations should be compelled to pay them, and you must not suffer their
successors to be molested on account of the indebtedness of others.
Published on the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate of
Mamertinus and Nevitta, 362.
24. The Same Emperor to Leontius, Consular of Palestine.

from the duties of his office.
Given at Antioch, on the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Julian,
Consul for the fourth time, and Sallust, 363.
25. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to the Byzantines.
Decurions cannot, by the order of a Governor, be compelled to go beyond the
limits of their city, unless public necessity requires it.
Given at Aquileia, on the day before the Idesof September, during the Consulate
of Jovian and Varronian, 364.
26. The Same Emperors to Modestus, Prsetorian Prefect.
Some decurions, induced by idleness, abandon their office in the city, seek
solitude and secret places, and, under the pretence of religion, associate with
hermits. Therefore, by the present law, We order that persons of this kind
shall be arrested, torn from their hiding-places, and recalled for the purpose
of performing their municipal functions; and, by the terms of this Our law, We
decree that those who are obliged to discharge public duties cannot avoid them
under the pretext of attending to their private affairs.
Published on the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of Valentinian and
Valens, 365.
27. The Same Emperors to the Sitisensian Moors.
Anyone required to perform the duties of the decurionate cannot claim exemption
on account of a privilege bestowed upon his father as a reward for service in
the army. If he is descended from a grandfather who was a soldier, and a father
who was a decurion, he will succeed to the duties of his father.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate of Valentinian
and Valens, 365.

Consulate of Valentinian and Valens, 368.

Children born in wedlock to those who are attached to Our household, and whose
father is a decurion, do not follow the condition of their father, but that of
their mother.
30. The Same Emperors.
There is no doubt that the Attorneys of the State can make use of public
actions.
31. The Emperors Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian to Modestus, Prsetorian
Prefect.
Persons, no matter what their lineage may be, who are descended from decurions,
are obliged to perform the duties of public office. Moreover, those who conceal
them, and continue to do so, thereby subordinating the public welfare to their
own interest, shall be condemned to infamy, and their property shall be
confiscated.
Given on the third of the Idesof July, during the Consulate of Gratian, Consul
for the second time, and Probus, 371.
32. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Neo* therius,
Prsetorian Prefect.
Artisans who have renounced their position as decurions, and the official
duties required of them, shall be restored to their order. Other persons
implicated shall be severely punished.
Given at Thessalonica, on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof April, during the
Consulate of Gratian, Consul for the fifth time, and Theodosius, 380.
33. The Same Emperors to Eutropius, Prsetorian Prefect.
All judges and Governors of provinces must refrain from the rash usurpation of
authority, and remember that they cannot subject persons of eminent rank, or
decurions, to corporeal punishment for any negligence or error of which they
may be guilty. Therefore, if a judge, in an outburst of anger, should dare to
subject to torture any man of illustrious rank, or a decurion, or a senator of
his curia(if it is necessary to say so), he shall be fined twenty pounds of
gold, and be branded with perpetual infamy, which he cannot evade by means of a
special Imperial Rescript; and his subordinates shall be compelled to pay a
fine of fifty pounds of gold to the Treasury, for the reason that they did not
resist the illegal act of the judge, which We have given them full power to do.
Given at Heraclia, on the twelfth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate
of Eucherius and Syagrius, 381.
34. The Same Emperors to Florus, Prsetorian Prefect.
When anyone thinks that the management of his affairs should be entrusted to a
decurion, he shall be severely punished, after having been deprived of his
rank. The official, however, who, unmindful of his freedom and his position,
degraded himself by accepting such a servile employment, shall be sent into
exile.1
1 At Rome, not only manual labor, but also the care and supervision of estates,
and the business of accountants, were principally in the hands of slaves, who
were often men of excellent education and great financial ability.
Notwithstanding their talents and acquirements, the occupations exercised by
them were generally considered debasing, and unworthy of the dignity of a
freeman. --- ED.
35. The Same Emperors to Posthumianus, Prsetorian Prefect.
Your Highness must see that the decrees formerly promulgated are obeyed by the
sons of decurions, and that those who, under the pretext of being advocates,
refuse to obey the rules of their order, are compelled to discharge all their
duties; for although necessity may not demand that this be done, still the
country does not release them from
their performance.
Moreover, Your Highness must provide that the sons of teachers, who are
descended from the families of decurions, are, in like manner, forced to
discharge the municipal employments to which they are
liable.
Given at Constantinople, on the eighth of the Idesof April, during the
Consulate of Merobaudus, Consul for the second time, and Satur-ninus, 383.
36. The Same Emperors to Basilius, Count of the Sacred Largesses.
Every decurion, as in the case of the Senatorial Order, shall follow the
condition of his father, nor shall any rescript, obtained for special purposes,
be valid in cases of this kind, where someone, relying upon the origin of his
mother, has passed from a superior to an inferior curia,nor will any exception
to this rule be permitted, no matter what the provincial custom may be.
Given at Rome, on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of
Merobaudus, Consul for the second time, and Saturninus, 383.
37. The Same Emperors to Posthumianus, Prsetorian Prefect.
Whenever persons who have obtained Imperial Rescripts avail themselves of the
same to be released from duties to which their origin, or any decision rendered
between the parties has made them liable, they will hereafter be able to
entertain no hope of evading the responsibility of their office, under the
pretext of an Imperial Rescript.
Given at Constantinople, on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof August, during the
Consulate of Merobaudus, Consul for the second time, and Saturninus, 383.
38. The Same Emperors to Cynegius, Prsetorian Prefect.
Let no person be assigned to a curiaby way of penalty, unless he should be a
fugitive, and have enlisted in the army in order to avoid performing the duties
of the station in which he was born. You will therefore notify all magistrates
under your jurisdiction that they are forbidden to permit any violator of the
law to be assigned to a curiaas a penalty, as one who has been guilty of crime
should not be honored, but subjected to punishment.
Given at Constantinople, on the eighth of the Idesof November, during the
Consulate of Richomer and Clearchus, 384.
39. The Same Emperors to Eusignius, Prsetorian Prefect.

Prince Honorius, and Evodius, 386.

misappropriated the public funds, or to have fraudulently made unlawful
assessments, or to have collected more than was due, shall, in accordance with
the custom of former times, be whipped with a scourge loaded with lead, by your
order, if he obtained his place from you, or by that of the ordinary judges
responsible for his appointment.
Given at Constantinople, on the Kalendsof April, under the Consulate of
Valentinian, Consul for the third time, and Eutropius, 387.
41. The Same Emperors to Cynegius, Prsetorian Prefect.
A decurion shall not, either by the solicitation of votes, or by intrigue,
change the condition in which he was born, and if he is entitled to relinquish
it on account of old age, he cannot do so before the appointment of his
successor, which usually takes place immediately.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Nonesof July, during the
Consulate of Valentinian, Consul for the third time, and Eutropius, 387.
42. The Emperors Theodosius, Arcadius, and Honorius to Abun-dantius, Count, and
General of Both Branches of the Service.
There is nothing in common between military men and decurions, and they are
hereby notified that they can do nothing which will not subject them to
superior authority. And no commander or Count shall permit any decurion or
person of high rank to suffer any injury, or be struck, or seriously beaten.
If anyone should hereafter, by a rash and inconsiderate act, inflict an illegal
injury upon a chief of the decurions, he is notified that he will be fined ten
pounds of gold.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Kalendsof August, during the
Consulate of Arcadius and Rufinus, 392.
43. The Same Emperors to Rufinus, Praetorian Prefect.
You must show no hesitation in causing all persons who are obliged by their
descent to exercise the functions of a decurion to be returned to their duties,
when they claim exemption by reason of various privileges and pretexts based
upon official documents, for We do not permit even rescripts or memoranda to be
of any avail in evading the duties of public office.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Idesof April, during the
Consulate of Theodosius, Consul for the third time, and Abun-dantius, 393.
44. The Same Emperors to Rufinus, Prsetorian Prefect.
No one shall be attached to a decurionate by reason of his claim that his
mother was connected with the family of such an official, because the weakness
of woman never renders persons liable to the performance of duties of this
kind, from which she herself is exempt.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifth of the Idesof August, during the
Consulate of Theodosius, Consul for the third time, and Abundan-tius, 393.
45. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Theodore, Prsetorian Prefect.

incapable of performing their public functions.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof February, during the Consulate of
Olybrius and Probinus, 395.
46. The Same Emperors to Ennoius, Proconsul of Africa.
Appointments should not be postponed when all those who are inscribed upon the
registers of the curiaare unable to be present, for the absence of a few
members, whether it be unavoidable or accidental, does not invalidate an act
formally agreed to by a two-thirds majority, as two-thirds of the order is
considered to represent the voice of the entire curiaof the city.
Given at Milan, on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof June, during the Consulate
of Olybrius and Probinus, 395.
47. The Same Emperors.
Decurions who have obtained the rank of count should exercise carefully
supervision over those subject to their authority, and not' think that by the
acquisition of their new dignity they are entitled to regard the orders of
judges with contempt. If they continue to be guilty of the same fault, they
should be subjected to a fine of five pounds of gold, and be deprived of the
position of which they are unworthy.
Given at Constantinople, on the fourth of the Kalendsof January, during .the
Consulate of Olybrius and Probinus, 395.
48. The Same Emperors.
With regard to the succession of decurions, We decree that even if their
fathers are dead, the right of agnation shall prevail.

50. The Same Emperors to Eutychianus, Praetorian Prefect.
All decurions, without exemption, shall remain forever attached to their
original and proper curia;and all those who, either by fraud or intrigue, have
obtained the government and administration of provinces, are hereby notified
that they shall not only be recalled to their curia,but shall also be compelled
to perform all the duties of their offices from the very beginning.
Given at Constantinople, on the eighth of the Kalendsof November, during the
Consulate of Honorius, Consul for the fourth time, and Eutychianus, 398.
51. The Same Emperors and Theodosius to Messala, Prsetorian Prefect.
Although it has been provided by a suitable amendment that decurions who have
abandoned their duties under a pretext of enlisting in the army shall be
returned to their offices, still, for the reason that they committed this act
with fraudulent intent, so that, having passed the boundaries of their
provinces, and access to them being no longer available, they might obtain
dismissal in foreign countries, in order that they may no longer entertain the
hope of concealment to the disadvantage of the decurionate, and secure the
benefit of immunity, it is hereby decided that if any of them should attempt to
withdraw from the decurionate, or abandon it, their property shall be used to
indemnify the curiawhich they have deserted, if, for the purpose of escaping
prosecution, or evading their civil obligations, they should join the army,
which is forbidden, or be guilty of any fraud whatsoever.
Therefore, if after having been summoned by proclamation (being such persons as
clearly belong to the curia),they prefer to remain concealed, rather than to
return within the period of a year, they are hereby notified that, after the
year has elapsed, their property shall be seized by the authority of the
Governor of the province for the benefit of the curiawhich they have deserted.
No complaints which they may make concerning the shortness of the time shall be
heard.
Given on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof September, during the Consulate of
Theodore, Consul for the fifth time, 399.
52. The Same Emperors to Probinus, Proconsul of Africa.
Can a magistrate be found who is so unjust as to compel a decurion, belonging
to a city which abounds in them, to perform his official functions longer or
more frequently than he should do, simply because some of them do not become
familiar with the duties of their employment, and others are, in consequence,
compelled to perform them constantly and repeatedly?
Given at Milan, on the sixteenth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate
of Csesarius and Atticus, 397.
53. The Same Emperors to Eucherius, Proconsul of Africa.
A duumvir cannot exert the authority of his office with immunity beyond the
limits of the territory of his own city.
Given at Ravenna, on the sixth of the Idesof March, during the Consulate of
Honorius, Consul for the ninth time, and Theodosius, 412.
54. The Same Emperors to Palladius, Prsetorian Prefect.
We order by this general law, that if any official should desire to claim a
decurion belonging to his curia,he shall be permitted to arrest him with his
own hand, if he cannot obtain the aid of the Governor, but he is notified that
the fugitive should be immediately brought before the Governor for examination
(so that if any question should arise as to his having a good defense, it may
be heard), and if the said official does not dispose of the case within three
months from the time of its commencement, and restore the defendant, if
convicted, to the performance of his duties, after having imposed the penalty;
or decide that he is free from liability, he shall be compelled to pay a fine
of ten pounds of gold, and his subordinate officers shall also be mulcted in an
equal sum.
Given at Ravenna, on the fifth of the Nonesof May, during the Consulate of
Theodosius, Consul for the seventh time, and Palladius, 415.
55. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Isidore, Prsetorian Prefect.
If a decurion, or any other member of the curia,should be so bold as to enlist
in the army, he shall not be permitted to avail himself of any prescription,
but must be returned to his former condition; and neither he himself, nor any
of his children born after an event of this kind has occurred, shall be
permitted to renounce the duties which they owe to the State.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Nonesof April, during the
Consulate of Isidore and Senator, 436.
56. The Same Emperors to Isidore, Prsetorian Prefect.
The Chief decurions of Alexandria, although they perform the functions of
advocates, are, nevertheless, not charged with any duties outside of the city,
nor are they compelled to perform any public duty except in their own
municipality. The decurion highest in rank who, after having filled all the
subordinate offices, has obtained this position, shall, after having enjoyed,
for the term of two years, the dignity to which he has attained, be raised to
the rank of count, but he will still continue to be a decurion.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Nonesof June, during the
Consulate of Isidore and Senator, 436.
57. The Same Emperors to Isidore, Prastorian Prefect.
We decree that the five Chief Decurions of the City of Alexandria shall be
exempt from all corporeal punishment, and free to defend the advantages of
their country with their voices. They can, however, if guilty of any criminal
act, be subject to a pecuniary fine, which shall
be imposed by the distinguished augustal prefect in the presence of the curia.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Nonesof June, during the
Consulate of Isidore and Senator, 436.
58. The Same Emperors to Isidore, Praetorian Prefect.
Anyone who has served as a public official for forty years, in the City of
Alexandria, shall, in consideration of his merits, be exempt from corporeal,
but not from pecuniary penalties, so that persons who are well and favorably
known may be entitled to this privilege, and those who are unworthy may not
indiscriminately enjoy it.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Nonesof June, during the
Consulate of Isidore and Senator, 436.
59. The Same Emperors to Isidore, Prsetorian Prefect.
If the hypomnematographishould appoint persons to public office with their
consent, We order that the confirmation of the illustrious augustal prefect,
who is frequently corrupt, shall not be required, but that the consent of both
parties will be sufficient in order that the appointee may begin to discharge
the duties which he has not refused; still, the above-mentioned judge must be
notified of the appointment which has been made without his sanction, and if he
should delay to acquiesce in, or confirm the appointment, he is hereby notified
that he will be liable to a fine of twenty pounds of gold.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Nonesof August, during the
Consulship of Isidore and Senator, 436.
60. The Same Emperors.
No one who became a member of a curiaby birth can perform his official
functions by means of a substitute, but he himself must discharge the duty
which he owes to his city, even though he may be a man of high rank, unless
this has been granted him as a special privilege. Those who have attained to
the rank of illustrious are not prohibited from discharging their duties
through substitutes, but they do so at the risk of their property.
61. The Emperor Leo.
We decree that neither the illustrious Dorotheus, the title to whose property
must not be called in question, nor Irenseus, the eminent tribune and notary,
shall be subject to annoyance on account of their having inherited the
condition of decurion, although their parents had not attained to the rank of
illustrious before they were born. Their children, also, whether they are now
in existence, or may subsequently come into the world, as well as their
descendants to the end of time, shall be exempt from the civil obligations
imposed by the condition of decurion; and the law of the Emperor Julian, of
Divine Memory, which was promulgated with reference to the maternal line and
its relations to the decurionate of the City of Antioch, shall not, in any
respect apply to the illustrious Dorotheus, or the eminent Ironeus, or to any
of
their property, or to their children who are in existence at present, or may be
born hereafter, nor will it have any effect so far as the property of the
latter is concerned. We order, however, that this law shall continue to be
applicable to all persons connected through the maternal line with the
decurionate of the said City of Antioch.
62. The Same Emperor.
If a child born to the daughter of a decurion of the magnificent City of
Antioch, and to a father who is not liable to the performance of civil duties
in any other town, should, while being examined by a judge of the province,
voluntarily acknowledge, or be proved to be the son of the daughter of a
decurion, and his name should be recorded in the register of that order, he
must not expect to have the power to deny or evade the duties imposed upon him
by his condition; and let him not attempt to reject the position in the
curiaacquired through his maternal grandfather, or entertain any doubt that he
is obliged to perform the functions of the decurionate.
If, however, any curiato which the present law refers should think that a child
born of the daughter of a decurion ought to be excluded from membership, it
can, under no circumstances, exclude his offspring, for We do not suffer a
public charge to be imposed upon grandsons, great-grandsons, or the more remote
descendants of a person who has been excluded from membership in the curia,and
is the child of the daughter of a decurion.
63. The Same Emperor.
We decree that neither the persons nor the property of men of illustrious rank
shall be molested on account of their status as members of a curia,and anyone
who makes an attempt to do so shall pay the penalty prescribed for sacrilege.
(1) No one can doubt that all those born to a father who has held any high
employment, or is still discharging the duties of the same, can, with his
father, be subject to annoyance because of his connection with the decurionate,
and both their persons and property shall be free from molestation on this
account.
64. The Emperor Zeno.
We wish that none of those liable to perform the duties of the decurionate who,
from the beginning of Our reign, have been, or may be appointed to the office
of Count of Private Affairs, either of the Emperor, or of the Empress, or to
that of Count of the Sacred Largesses, or Count of Domestic Affairs, or
Qusestor, or Master of the Offices, shall, for this reason, be exempt from the
obligations of the decurionate, but they shall be liable to them, together with
their children, no matter when they may have been born; and a lien shall exist
on their property to insure the performance of the functions of the
decurionate, after they have relinquished the administration of their other
employment, unless they have been exempted in this respect by the grant of well
known legal privileges, for We desire all privileges
conceded by the Imperial Constitutions to be preserved intact and inviolate.
In order, however, that persons appointed to such offices may not appear to
have only an empty name, they can discharge the duties of the decurionate by
means of substitutes selected by themselves, at the risk of their own property,
and will retain the privileges of their rank unimpaired. Moreover, We decree
that those who have acquired any of the dignities aforesaid before the
beginning of Our reign shall, along with their property, be released from the
cpnnections and burdens of the decurionate, and this also applies to any
children which may have been born to them after they attained the dignity
aforesaid.
Again, with reference to those who, at any time, have become, or may hereafter
become patricians, consuls, or men of consular rank, or generals of the army,
or Praetorian Prefects of the East, or of Illyria; or who have obtained the
government of any city while they were administering the offices aforesaid, or
may hereafter adminster them, We decree that they shall, together with their
property and all children born to them after being raised to the dignity
aforesaid, be released from all the obligations and burdens of the decurionate.
65. The Emperor Anastasius.
We think that the Constitution of the Emperor Zeno, of Divine Memory, which was
promulgated with reference to decurions, after their exemption from the
obligations of their condition by the exercise of high employments, should only
be corrected in that part which provides that those who, before the said
constitution was published (and from the beginning of the reign of the Emperor
Zeno, of Divine Memory) had been raised to the dignity of Count of Private
Affairs of the Emperor, or Empress, or to that of Count of the Sacred
Largesses, or to that of Count of Domestic Affairs, or to that of Quaestor, or
Master of the Offices, although they may be engaged in the actual
administration of one of the employments aforesaid, shall, by no means, be
permitted to evade the duties imposed by the decurionate; but shall be bound,
together with their children (no matter when the latter were born) and their
property, to discharge the duties of the decurionate, after they have
relinquished the administration of one of the offices aforesaid, unless they
have been exempted by some well-known legal privilege. For We order that any
privileges which may have previously been acquired by them through their
administration of one of the high offices aforesaid shall be enjoyed by them
intact and unimpaired, as well as by their children and their property, where
they have administered the affairs of all the offices above mentioned, or of
only one of the same, so that by the release of the duties and the civil
functions attaching to their condition which was granted them by former
Imperial Decrees, they themselves, as well as their children born after their
fathers have relinquished the administration of a public employment of this
kind, together with their own property, may enjoy the exemption; even if, in
accordance with the terms of the Constitution of the Emperor Zeno, of Divine
Memory, they should have dis-
charged, either personally or by means of substitutes, the duties imposed upon
them by the decurionate.
The above-mentioned Constitution of the Emperor Zeno, of Divine Memory, shall
remain in force from the day on which it was promulgated, as it is proper to
enact laws for future generations, and not to give rise to vexatious proceedngs
having reference to events which have already transpired.
66. The Emperor Justinian.
With a view to the interest of the members of decurionates, We decree that no
one shall flatter himself that he can be released from the performance of his
duties in any other way than that to be hereinafter specified, but he is
notified that he can only obtain exemption from the duties attached to his
condition, as decurion, in the manner which We prescribe, and that all other
methods which are not included in the present law are, from this day,
abolished. Therefore, if anyone should obtain the highest rank of the
patriciate, or the insignia of the honorary consulate, or should be raised to
that office in the ordinary course of affairs, so as to become either a consul
or a man of consular rank, or should obtain the insignia of the Praetorian
Prefecture, or the dignity of Urban Prefect, in the regular way, or should be
invested with the command of the army, let him rejoice in the knowledge that he
is freed from the condition of decurion, together with his property, and his
children which have been born after he attained the dignity, or administered
the office aforesaid, but any children born before that time shall remain in
their former condition.
All persons raised to these dignities, as well as to that of Advocates of the
Treasury, as well as those attached to the Prefectures of the Orient and
Illyria, and to the Urban Prefectures, shall, whenever they are appointed
Advocates of the Treasury, be released from the duties imposed by the
decurionate, together with their property and their children, whether the
latter were born before or after their father attained the rank aforesaid.
Those illustrious nobles who have been charged with the management of the
affairs of the Empire were also released from their curial duties by the
ancient law, and the illustrious men who discharge the functions of Imperial
Secretaries, and draw up the Imperial Epistles and Memorials, and the records
of decrees and decisions, shall be free from the obligations of the
decurionate, together with their property, and any children whom they have had
after having been promoted to the offices aforesaid. We retain this privilege
for them intact and unimpaired, in consideration of the labors which they have
performed in many ways for a long and extended period of time; hence, in
accordance with what We have previously stated, all these persons, together
with their property and their offspring, are released from the obligations of
the decurionate.
We, however, do not permit children born previously to any future Advocate of
the Treasury to be exempt from curial duties, in order to prevent others from
demanding a privilege which is not accorded
to the offspring of the highest rank, as above mentioned; but any who have been
born before their fathers obtained the office of Advocate of the Treasury shall
remain in their former condition.
With reference to other methods than those which We have specifically
enumerated, whether they were included in the ancient laws or not (as, for
instance, the case of one who was descended from three males, who was formerly
permitted to occupy a high position in the Senate), We by no means allow any of
them to be available for the purpose of securing exemption from curial duties;
no matter if a pragmatic sanction was issued on this subject, or a decision of
the Prefecture was rendered, or any other means whatever was devised; they
shall all be absolutely void, and considered as never having been of any force;
and the decurions who make use of them shall be restored to their cities, and
their property shall still remain liable, and no excuse offered by them shall,
under any circumstances, be accepted.
TITLE XXXII.
WHERE A SLAVE OK A FREEDMAN ASPIRES TO THE OFFICE OF DECURION. .
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars.
Where a freedman has not obtained the privilege of wearing a gold ring, or has
not been restored to his rights of birth, the Governor of the province shall
not permit him to take part in the affairs of the curia,but shall inflict upon
him a penalty in accordance with the severity of the law.
2. The Emperor Constantine.
If the Governor of the province should ascertain that the person who ,is
discharging the duties of sedile is your slave, and finds that he aspired to
that office without being ignorant of his status, he must inflict a suitable
punishment upon him for having defiled the dignity of the decurionate with the
stigma of slavery. If, however, he aspired to that office through mistake, for
the reason that his mother was, by public report, considered to be free, and he
himself was the son of a decurion, the Governor shall merely restore him to
your possession.
TITLE XXXIII.
THE LANDS OF DECURIONS SHALL NOT BE ALIENATED UNLESS BY VIRTUE OF A DECREE.
1. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Cyne-gius, Praetorian
Prefect.
When a decurion, compelled by necessity, desires to sell any land in the
country or in town, he should appear before a competent judge, and explain to
him in detail all the causes which force him to take this step; and he shall
only obtain authority to dispose of the property
where he can prove the necessity for the alienation of the same. The gale will
be void if this formality is neglected. This course is adopted to prevent the
vendor from wasting his property, and the purchaser, whatever his condition may
be, from being subjected to injustice. Hence the vendor cannot make any
complaint that he has either been deceived by fraud, or oppressed by the power
of the purchaser, as it will appear from the records that the necessity for the
sale existed, and that the purchaser consented to it.
If, however, anyone should, in violation of what has been prohibited, by means
of secret machinations, or through the agency of persons fraudulently
introduced, buy land anywhere from a decurion, he is hereby notified that he
will be deprived of the price that he paid, and that the land which he
purchased, together with its crops, will be returned.
Given at Constantinople, on the eighth of the Kalendsof December, during the
Consulate of Our Prince Honorius, and Evodius, 386.
2. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Florentius, Prse-torian Prefect.
No sale of hereditary property acquired by a curia,nor any release of a debtor
to the estate who made the payment, shall be permitted, unless the reason for
making the contract or for releasing the obligation shall have been examined
and approved in writing by all, or a majority of the decurions.
We order that whatever may be obtained from such a transaction shall be
expended for the purchase of land, the entire income of which (as has already
been stated) shall be carefully preserved for the public necessities of the
curia.The farmers of this revenue should be selected with the consent of all
the decurions, and especially of the more wealthy ones, and be required to
furnish proper security for the performance of their duties.
3. The Emperor Zeno.
We forbid decurions to sell any real property of any description, or any slaves
attached thereto, without first applying for a decree. They are, however,
permitted to make donations, or exchanges, or enter into any other contracts
whatsoever, as the Imperial Constitutions, which have been promulgated by
former Emperors, have stated in many places that the purchase-money is not to
be refunded, and for this reason it is clearly to be understood that a contract
of sale cannot be entered into by decurions without a decree. We further order
that when a sale takes place, a decree must be secured by the vendors (as has
already been stated) and those who buy from them will not incur any loss either
personally, or on account of the transaction, or by reason of theatrical
generosity (which is said to frequently occur). The decree issued in
confirmation of the sale should not be committed to writing, but should be
rendered by a competent judge in the presence of the decurions, or a majority
of them, without any view to the return of the property or any injury to the
contracting parties.


TITLE XXXIV.  WHEN AND To WHOM THE FOURTH PART OF THE PROPERTY OP
DECURIONS IS DUE, AND CONCERNING THE METHOD OF DISTRIBUTING THE SAME.

1. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian.
We decree that when he who succeeds to a decurion as heir does not himself
belong to the order, whether he is an heir to the whole estate or only to a
portion of the same, or by virtue of being the possessor of the property, the
fourth part of the estate can legally be demanded from the curia.

2. The Same Emperors to Apollonius, Prsetorian Prefect.
We remember that an Imperial law was recently promulgated, by whose provisions
the fourth part of the estate of deceased decurions, whether they died testate
or intestate, passes to anyone whomsoever (with the exception of sons who are
decurions), and was referred to the body of the decurionate; but many persons
seized this opportunity to destroy the property of the entire estate by
claiming an interest in everything for themselves, so that they mutilated and
defaced all of it, and in endeavoring to secure their own rights, manifested an
inclination to injure others equally interested.
In order to take proper measures for the correction of this abuse, We do hereby
forbid decurions to seize the property of a deceased person by their own
authority. The heir, however, to whom the estate passed either as intestate, or
by a last will, directly, or under the terms of a trust, shall cause the entire
inheritance which was left to be divided into four parts, and lots shall be
cast to determine whether the curia,the heir, or beneficiary of the trust shall
have the right to select the fourth or the three-fourths of said estate
respectively, so that in this way the heirs of the deceased and the curiawill
be freed from the inconvenience of a joint and undivided ownership of the same.
It is a common fault for property jointly held to be neglected, as it is
considered that he has nothing who has not all, and hence each one suffers his
share to be deteriorated on account of the grudge which he entertains against
the others. Where, however, the fourth part of the estate of a deceased person
must be transferred to the curia,We permit the immovable property which cannot
easily be concealed, and whose production cannot injure anyone, to be appraised
and divided in the presence of the decurions. We do not, however, permit
movable property or that which is capable of moving itself, or implements, or
anything else consisting merely of a right, to be publicly produced and
divided; but We order that the statements of the heirs of the deceased (they
having been first sworn) shall be believed, when they have made a careful
estimate of the nature and value of the estate. For what is so harsh or inhuman
as, by the exhibition and display of private property, to reveal the
wretchedness of poverty, and expose wealth to envy ? In the collection of
debts, if the heirs refuse to pay the price of the fourth part of the claim to
which the decurionate is entitled, after hav-
ing publicly furnished proper security, each one shall be entitled to collect
his share from the debtors.
Likewise, on the other hand, the heirs, as well as the curia,can be compelled
to pay their proportionate shares of the indebtedness, if the deceased owed
money to anyone. When the heirs, after having been frequently notified, refuse
to take the oath, then a careful inventory of all the personal property shall
be drawn up by the members of the curia,just as in the case of real estate,
that is to say, all of the property belonging to the deceased having been
produced in public, an appraisement and division of the same shall be made in
the presence of the decurions. Moreover, We decree that in all cases where the
curiais entitled to a fourth part of the estate, any transactions concluded by
the parties in interest shall remain valid and incontrovertible.
(1) As in the case of sons, grandsons, and great-grandsons of decurions, to
whom We have decreed that estates shall descend intact, We now order that the
ownership of the same shall not be affected in the case of the daughter,
granddaughter, great-granddaughter of a chief decurion of the same city from
which her father, grandfather, or great-grandfather derived his origin, whether
she is entitled to the estate as heir at law, or under the terms of a will. If,
however, after the death of her father, she should marry, or become a widow, or
be under or over the age of puberty, We desire that those who have passed that
age or are widows shall wait for three years after their father's death, so
that, during this period, the fourth of the estate due to the curiamay remain
in suspense; or if one of them should marry a decurion of the same city, within
that time the entire estate shall vest in her permanently. But if, within the
said time, she should marry a man not belonging to the curia,or should remain
unmarried, the abovementioned portion of the entire estate, together with the
profits of the urban and rustic property, shall be adjudged to the curia,after
the. said term of three years has expired. Provided, however, that the rule
with reference to the choice of the fourth, or three-fourths of the estate, and
the oath, as well as the appraisement of the movable property and the bringing
of actions and pleading of exceptions (as has been already stated with
reference to strangers) is observed. Where the mother or grandmother of the
deceased, at the time when the son or grandson died, married a decurion of the
same city, We do not permit her to suffer the loss of the fourth part of the
estate.
Again, We release a foreign heir who was not related to the deceased, but is
attached to the city to which the latter belonged, from the loss of the fourth
part of the estate above mentioned.
Given at Constantinople, on the seventh of the Idesof March, during the
Consulate of Dioscorus and Eudoxius, 442.

3. The Emperor Justinian.
Where the member of a decurionate left but a small portion of his estate to
several of his sons or daughters, who survived him, or bequeathed it to one son
or several daughters (but still sufficient to exclude them from instituting
proceedings on the ground that the will was inofficious), and left the
remainder of his .estate to others, so that
by this distribution of the same a very small part of it was transmitted to his
child or children attached to the curia,We, for the purpose of remedying this
injustice, and that the rights of a decurion may remain unimpaired, whether any
children, grandchildren, or great-grandchildren are attached to the curia,do
hereby decree that a testator cannot transmit less than the fourth part of his
estate to his male heirs, whether there is one son or several; and that, where
there are any sisters there shall be no diminution, so far as they are
concerned, so that the curiamay not only have the benefit of their, services,
but also of their property. In addition to this, We order that if any decurion
should die, leaving several daughters, one of whom is married to a member of
the curia,and received only a small portion of the estate, the remainder having
been left to other daughters, or to strangers, the testator will not be
considered to have complied with the terms of the law of the Emperor
Theodosius, addressed to Apollonius; but on the other hand, the curiawill be
entitled to the fourth part of his estate, whether it is to be given to the
daughter who married the decurion, or is to be collected from the other heirs.
There is no doubt that the daughter who married the decurion will be exempt
from contributing any part of the fourth above mentioned, as the personal
services of a husband, performed for the benefit of the curia,render this
unnecessary.
This rule shall be observed not only where the testator, a decurion, left a
will, but also when he dies intestate. If, however, an amount less than the
fourth part of the estate of the father, or none at all, should be left, this
must by all means be given or transferred to the son, who is a decurion, or to
the daughter who married a decurion of the same city; and no objection should
be raised by the curiaif, in accordance with the law aforesaid, either the son,
grandson, great-grandson, father, grandfather, or great-grandfather, left by
the deceased decurion, should have been released from his obligations to the
curia,on account of having been raised to any dignity, or for any other reason;
as, in a case of this kind, We most certainly desire the Theodosian Law to be
disregarded.
And, generally speaking, We decree that, in every instance, neither male nor
female children belonging to the family of a decurion, who are married, shall
receive less than the fourth part of the estate of their father. And, when
there are no sons or daughters, or other heirs, the curiaitself shall, in
accordance with the terms of former laws, be entitled to the fourth part of the
estate of the decurion, as a consolation for his loss.



TITLE XXXV.
CONCERNING THE CLAIM OF A CURIA TO PROPERTY WHICH HAS BEEN GRATUITOUSLY
TRANSFERRED.

1. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Apollonius, Prse-torian Prefect.
We order that the penalty of four siliquseshall only be collected in the case
of the gratuitous transfer of real property, and not for that
of slaves or animals, or any other chattels, and if the parties are not
decurions We release them from liability, where ancestors make a transfer to
their descendants, so that if a father, grandfather, or greatgrandfather,
either by his last will, or by a donation inter vivos,should transfer any of
his estate to his son, grandson, great-grandson, or his daughter,
granddaughter, or great-granddaughter, and it makes no difference whether they
are married to decurions or not), it shall not be subject to the imposition of
the penalty aforesaid.
Likewise, on the other hand, where descendants convey property belonging to
them to their ascendants, who are connected with them by ties of blood,
liberality of this kind shall not be charged with any burden, for a natural
debt is discharged under the designation of generosity, where a transaction
like this takes place between persons nearly related to one another.
We also order that the authority of this law shall be enforced when, in case of
intestacy, heirs in the degrees above designated succeed to an estate. In
successions of this kind the transaction is rather the payment of a debt than
the tender of a gift, as the transfer is made rather on account of relationship
than from motives of generosity. Other persons, however, even though they may
be united by ties of blood, shall never be entitled to enjoy property belonging
to a decurion without payment of the above-mentioned imposition, unless he who
obtained the property gratuitously is a member of the decurionate of the same
city, and who, although he is classed as a stranger, is released from the
payment of the tax on the property given to him; for as long as the condition
of the person remains the same, that of the property should not be altered.
We desire that a transfer of property should only be called gratuitous, and be
exempt from the burden aforesaid, when it comes into the hands of anyone by
inheritance, as a legacy, a bequest subject to a trust, a donation causa
mortis,or is acquired under the terms of a will by any person whomsoever. A
donation inter vivos,which is gratuitously bestowed, deserves this name, and is
subject to the penalty. Where, however, a future father-in-law makes a donation
in consideration of his prospective relationship by marriage to the betrothed
of his son, grandson, or great-grandson; or her father should endow his
daughter, granddaughter, or great-granddaughter, whether she was about to marry
a decurion or a stranger, even though it may have been agreed that, in case of
death or divorce, the property which was given as dowry should belong to the
person who received it, it shall not be classed as gratuitous, or be subject to
the penalty; for it is not sanctioned by law that marriage, which is surrounded
with so many and such great difficulties, should be loaded down with additional
burdens. Moreover, the property which, in the cases above mentioned, has once
obtained the name of being gratuitously bestowed, even though it may have been
transferred by him or her who received it to someone else either under the
terms of a sale, or of any other kind of contract, is undoubtedly conveyed
subject to the above-mentioned penalty; so that the person who knowingly
received it encumbered in this manner will
have only himself to blame; or, if he accepted it ignorantly, he will be
entitled to recover any damages which he may have sustained.
On the other hand, if an agreement of any kind was not, in the beginning, to be
classed as a gratuitous transaction, and the title to the property should
afterwards vest in anyone under a lucrative title, it will not be subject to
the above-mentioned imposition; for in such cases there is no occasion for
merger, even though the latter title may be based on the former one, unless
what came into his hands in the course of trade belonged to a decurion, and was
transferred to another either under the terms of a last will through an
intestate succession, or by virtue of a donation inter vivos;for then, because
it once belonged to a decurion, it will acquire the condition and be subject to
the penalty of property gratuitously conveyed, without reference to any prior
title.
Given at Constantinople, on the seventh of the Idesof March, during the fifth
Consulate of Dioscorus and Eudoxius, 422.


TITLE XXXVI.
CONCERNING THE PAYMENT OF SALARIES.

1. The Emperor Constantine to Marcellimis, Governor.
A salary shall not be paid to anyone out of funds belonging to the State,
unless he has been especially authorized by Us to receive it.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifth of the Nonesof October, during the
Consulate of Liminius and Catullinus, 349.


TITLE XXXVII.
WHERE A DECURION, HAVING LEFT THE CITY, PREFERS TO RESIDE IN THE COUNTRY.

1. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Eutychiamis, Prx-torian Prefect.
We order that all decurions shall hereby be warned not to leave or abandon
their cities for the purpose of residing in the country, and they are notified
that the land which they preferred to the city shall be confiscated to the
Treasury, and that they will lose the property on account of which they have
manifested such a neglect of duty by evading their civil obligations.
Given at Constantinople, on the eighteenth of the Kalendsof January, during the
Consulate of Arcadius, Consul for the fourth time, and Honorius, Consul for the
third time, 396.
TITLE XXXVIII.
CONCERNING THE CITIZENS OF TOWNS AND NATIVES. 1. The Emperor Alexander.
As you allege that you are a native of Byblius, and a citizen of Berytus, it is
but reasonable that you should be compelled to perform your municipal duties in
both cities.
2. The Emperor Gordian to Frontonus.
If (as you state) she who manumitted you under the terms of a trust, and from
whom you obtained your lawful freedom, derived her origin from the province of
Aquitania, you also are of the same status, and a citizen of the same city as
she who manumitted you, for it was long since decided that persons who have
been manumitted under a trust follow the condition of those who actually gave
them their liberty, and not that of those who requested that it be granted.
3. The Emperor Philip.
It is a well-established rule of law that sons can be compelled to accept
offices and discharge civil duties, not in the city where their mother derived
her origin (provided they have not retained their domicile there), even though
they themselves may have been born there, but in the city of their father's
birth.
4. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian.
It is clear that no one can, merely by his own will, renounce his origin.
5. The Emperor Constantine to Maximm, Vicegerent of the East.
Where anyone who is a native of a large or small town desires to leave it, and
become the resident of another, and attempts to offer a petition to Us praying
for permission to do so, or is guilty of any other fraud in order to avoid the
duties he owes to his own city, he shall be subject-to the burdens of the
decurionate in both the cities aforesaid; in one, on account of his choice, and
in the other, on account of his
origin.
Published on the eighth of the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate of
Paulinus and Julian, 325.
TITLE XXXIX.
CONCERNING RESIDENTS, AND WHERE ANYONE Is CONSIDERED TO HAVE His DOMICILE, AND
CONCERNING THOSE WHO RESIDE IN OTHER CITIES FOR THE PURPOSE OF PURSUING THEIR
STUDIES.
1. The Emperor Antoninus.
No objection can be urged against you if, being the resident of a city, you
have undertaken some public charge, provided that you have transferred your
domicile before being called to accept another office.
2. The Emperor Alexander.
Those who reside anywhere for the purpose of pursuing their studies are not
considered to have established their domicile in that place, unless they remain
there longer than ten years. According to an Epistle of the Divine Hadrian, a
father who frequently visits his
son, while the latter is pursuing his studies, cannot be considered to have
established his residence in the town where the latter is sojourning. If,
however, he can be proved in other ways to have his domicile in the magnificent
City of Laodicea, the falsehood by which he attempts to avoid the discharge of
his municipal duties will be of no advantage to him.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian.
It is true that those who do not live in any city,- but in the territory
subject to the jurisdiction of the same, will not, as residents, be required to
perform civil duties, or accept municipal offices.
4. The Same Emperors and Cassars.
As you state that you are either natives or inhabitants of the city in
question, the authority of public law does not compel you to perform municipal
functions, merely because you own a house or land therein, even though the said
property may have been acquired from the estate of a decurion.
5. The Same Emperors and Caesars.
If you have fixed your domicile in the country of your wife, or in any other
place whatsoever, you will, as a resident thereof, be legally obliged
voluntarily to discharge the municipal duties attaching to the same.
6. The Same Emperors and Cassars to MarceUinus.
It is perfectly certain that where a special privilege with reference to a city
does not exist, anyone can be compelled to perform municipal duties either by
reason of his birth, or through his voluntary establishment of a domicile.
7. The Same Emperors and Cassars.
Birth, manumission, a call to public office, or adoption renders a man a
citizen, but his domicile makes him a resident, as the Divine Hadrian clearly
stated in his Edict. There is no doubt that individuals have their domicile
where they have placed their household goods and the greater part of their
property and fortunes, and no one shall depart from thence unless something
requires him to do so, and whenever he does leave the place, he is considered
to be on a journey, and when he returns, to have completed it.
8. The Emperor Constantine.
Senators are considered to have their domicile in the Imperial City where they
enjoy the honors attaching to their position.
9. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens.
We raise women to the dignity of their husbands, render them noble by birth,
and establish jurisdiction over them, in accordance with their personal rank.
If they should subsequently marry men of inferior
station, having lost the rank of their first husbands, they will follow the
condition of the second, and also change their domiciles.
Given at Constantinople, on the fourth of the Kalendsof February, during the
Consulate of Arcadius, Consul for the second time, and Rufinus, 392.
TITLE XL.
CONCERNING THE NON-TRANSMISSION OP MUNICIPAL
DUTIES AND HONORS FROM FATHER TO SON, AND THE
INTERVALS WHICH EXIST.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus.
Just as municipal honors and offices cannot be continued in the same household,
when both father and son are decurions, so the times when these are vacant can
be of no benefit to others than those who are called to the same or other
offices, or who are bound to discharge the same or other duties. Moreover, with
reference to your son, who is an infant, and whom you desire to be a decurion,
although you may have pledged your faith for him hereafter, still, you yourself
cannot be compelled to perform the duties which would be exacted of him, as you
appear to have given your consent only to what he can be ordered to do.
2. The Emperor Gordian.
An interval of five years after the relinquishment of the duties of an office
must elapse before the same can again be resumed, and where different offices
are involved, the term of three years is required. To those who have been
employed on an embassy, the term of two years is granted.
3. The Same Emperor.
It has frequently been decided that the intervals of time which apply to one
person do not, by any means, apply to brothers, even though they may hold
property in common. Still, if the Governor of the province should find that you
have discharged your civil duties with fidelity, those shall be appointed who
have not yet performed their own, and are competent to do so, in order that you
may not again be called upon to discharge them.
TITLE XLI. CONCERNING CHARGES UPON ESTATES.
1. The Emperor Antoninus.
Civil functions must be performed in regular order, in proportion to the means
of the parties concerned.
2. The Same Emperor.
Civil duties which are imposed upon estates for the public welfare must be
discharged by all persons.
3. The Emperor Alexander.
Those who have obtained exemption from public office must still discharge the
duties imposed upon estates, among which is that of entertaining guests.
4. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus.
It does not seem to be contrary to the spirit of the decision by which the
Governor of the province decreed that the horses belonging to the decurionate
must be supported, to hold that this is not a personal, but a patrimonial
obligation; still, if it should be unjust, and you fail to appeal, the
obligation will remain unaltered.
5. The Emperors Cams, Carvnus, and Numerianus.No one can plead his age, or the
number of his children, by way of excuse from charges imposed upon his
patrimony.
6. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian.
A discrepancy exists between your admission and your claim, for you say that
you are a philosopher, and you have been conquered by avarice and rapacity, and
you alone venture to refuse the performance of the duties imposed upon your
patrimony. You can learn from the example of others that your attempt will be
fruitless.
1. The Same Emperors and Csesars.
Even minors are ordinarily subject to patrimonial charges. Therefore, you will
understand that it is in vain that you desire complete immunity, as it is
necessary for you to perform those duties which involve the expenditure of
money.
8. The Emperor Constantine.
The functions of the protostasiat,the priesthood, and the decapro-tiatare not
corporeal ones, and there is no doubt that they are solely patrimonial.
9. The Emperor Valentinian and Valens.
Women, also, are liable to charges imposed upon estates.
10. The Same Emperors and Gratian.
We have notified the Governors of provinces to inform all possessors of
property, and the other persons designated, of the amount of the extraordinary
assessment which they will be expected to pay. These have been included among
patrimonial charges, in order that they may be known to everyone, and the
public necessities be the more readily provided for.
TITLE XLII. IN WHAT WAY CIVIL OBLIGATIONS ARE DIVIDED.
1. The Emperor Alexander.
 If, as you state, you have appealed from the decree by which you were
appointed Superintendent of Couriers, and the Governor of the
province should ascertain that you are a member of another curia,he will not
permit you to be forced to perform the duties attaching to it, for the reason
that you should only be liable to perform those of the one to which you say you
belong.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian.
It is reasonable that persons who have been promoted to a higher office should
not be compelled to perform the duties of a lower one.
3. The Same Emperors.
As you assert that you have performed all the duties required of you, the
Governor of the province will see that you are not compelled to perform the
same ones a second time, if there is a sufficient number of citizens qualified
to do so.
4. The Same Emperors and Csesars.
The Governor of the province will not suffer you to be unreasonably oppressed
by the performance of civil duties from which others have been released; but,
being mindful of the law, as well as apprehensive of censure, he will see that
equality is preserved, and appointments made in their regular order.
TITLE XLIII.
CONCERNING THOSE WHO VOLUNTARILY ASSUME THE DISCHARGE OP PUBLIC DUTIES.
1. The Emperor Antoninm.
Veterans who, while they are able to avoid the discharge of civil duties
through the immunity granted them, prefer to be made de-curions in their native
country, cannot avail themselves of the excuse which they have once
relinquished, unless they have given their consent conditionally under an
agreement that they shall be entitled to exemption, or if they have only
consented to discharge a part of the duties of the employment.
2. The Emperor Alexander.
Where anyone who is exempt from the requirements of public office has
voluntarily accepted any position, except the decurionate, he shall not lose
the privilege to which he is entitled, although he may not for a short time
have availed himself of it, for the reason that he wished to be useful to his
country, or was induced by the hope of distinction.
3. The Emperor Leo.
He who, while not a member of the decurionate, has voluntarily exercised the
functions of a municipal office or employment in any city whatsoever, shall
not, in any way, be prejudiced with reference to his fortune or his status, but
he himself, as well as his children and their descendants, shall, together with
their property, remain free from every obligation of this kind, so that if the
performance of any duty should be enjoined upon them, with their consent, for
which reason it
was necessary for them to receive anything, and they refund the money which is
proved to have been paid, they can depart without any anxiety or fear with
reference to their status.
Moreover, when anyone of such persons voluntarily discharges all the duties or
functions of a decurion, or accepts the honors of the office without being
required to do so, We decree by this law that, on account of his generosity, he
shall be appointed a father of the city of which he voluntarily became a
citizen, if he should wish this to be done.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof November, during the Consulate of Basilicus
and Armericus, 465.
4. The Emperor Justinian.
When persons who are free from the obligations of the decurionate afterwards
join that order in any city, We desire that their children ---  not only those
which have already been born, but any which may be born after their voluntary
union with the decurionate --- shall remain free from its obligations, whether
their fathers joined the decurionate under the express condition that their
descendants should remain exempt from its duties, or whether they made no
mention whatever of this; and let no one venture to assert that they follow the
condition of their father for the reason that they were born or conceived after
his enrollment in the decurionate.
We hasten to establish this special privilege, in order that all persons may be
the more ready to contribute their aid to bodies of this kind. In order that
none of the heirs of such a decurion may suffer any uneasiness, We also decree
that his property shall be exempt from all charges of the decurionate; and if
any property of the deceased derived from the administration of the functions
of the office, or from the fourth part of his estate, should be proved to be
due to the same curiafor any other reason, his heirs shall entertain no doubt
that it must be transferred to that body.
Again, natural children whom their father gave, or might subsequently give to
the curiaunder the condition that he would have them as his lawful heirs, not
only under his will, but also in case of intestacy, are exempted from the
operation of the present law; and they shall not only be excepted in accordance
with the ancient enactments, but also under the present one, by Our express
order; so that the natural children themselves, together with all males
begotten by them, shall follow the condition of their father; or, in case there
should be no surviving male children, the fourth part of the estate of the
deceased shall pass to the decurionate.
TITLE XLIV.
CONCERNING THOSE WHO HAVE OBTAINED TEMPORARY EXEMPTION FROM THE DUTIES OF A
DECURIONATE.
1. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian.
No one shall be entitled to temporary exemption from the duties of a
decurionate unless, for good and sufficient reasons, a permit to that effect
has been granted by Us.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Nonesof June, during the
Consulate of Theodosius, Consul for the third time, and Abun-dantius, 390.
TITLE XLV.
CONCERNING EXEMPTION FROM OFFICIAL DUTIES. 1. The Emperor Gordian.
It has very recently been decided that exemption from public duties only
applies to those which have not been imposed by any law, Decree of the Senate,
or Imperial Constitution. In accordance with this legal rule, if you should be
summoned by the magistrates to the performance of extraordinary duties, and
appeal to the Governor, you can be protected by law.
TITLE XLVI.
CONCERNING THE DECREES OF DECURIONS HAVING
REFERENCE TO IMMUNITY GRANTED TO CERTAIN
OF THEIR COLLEAGUES.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian.
Immunity from public service cannot be granted by decurions to any of their
colleagues, with the exception of such as are instructors iinnliberal studies, or
are practicing the healing art.
2. The Same Emperors and C&sars.
Unwarranted decrees issued by the Order of Decurions are reprobated by the
Imperial Constitutions.
TITLE XLVII.
CONCERNING EXCUSES FROM THE DISCHARGE OF PUBLIC
DUTIES.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars.
^Those who are employed as Our attorneys are required to perform civil
functions which are suitable to their dignity.
_ 2. Extracts from the Acts of the Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the
Csesars.
._ The Emperor Diocletian spoke, as follows, to Firminus, Apollina-rius, and
the other Chief Decurions of the City of Antioch, who were present: "Exemption
from civil and personal functions has been granted to certain officials, that
is to say, protectors and commanders, and therefore persons of this kind shall
not be called to discharge either personal or civil duties."
3. The Same Emperors and Csesars.
Responsibility for guardianship does not excuse anyone from the discharge of
civil duties, nor will three guardianships of different households, imposed at
the same time, confer a benefit of this kind.
4. The Same Emperors and Caesars.
Performers on hydraulic organs cannot prove that exemption from civil duties is
granted them by law.
5. The Same Emperors and Csesars.
The agents of persons absent on business for the State are not exempt from the
performance of civil duties.
6. The Same Emperors and Ciesars to Gaius.
Immunity on account of their profession alone cannot be established to have
been granted to hunters by any law.
7. The Emperor Constantine.
In accordance with an ancient constitution, it appears that merchants, tailors,
linen-weavers, dyers of purple, and parthiarii,who furnish Us with clothing,
are exempt from all civil duties.
8. The Same Emperor to Taurus, Prsetorian Prefect.
It is decreed that no judge shall, hereafter, under any circumstances, place a
charge on the inhabitants of any province, but magistrates must sedulously
exercise supervision over all those which have been established under the-name
of tax, or have been imposed by Us directly or indirectly, or by virtue of
Epistles. When, however, any urgent necessity for this exists, We decree that
the question shall be referred to Your Highness and that you will become
responsible; and while the levy may be made provisionally, it should be brought
to Our knowledge, in order that it may be confirmed by Our order.
If anyone should, by a rash usurpation of power, attempt to violate this law,
he shall be liable to quadruple restitution. This severity ought to strike
terror into ordinary judges and their subordinates, and if any of them should
either with connivance, induced by favor, or through base dissimulation,
encourage the audacity of a decurion, they shall be punished with the penalty
of simple damages.
Given at Constantinople, on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof April, during the
Consulate of Valentinian and Valens, 354.
9. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens.
Precautions must be taken to prevent anyone from thinking that this, which is a
personal function, can be discharged by the payment of money.
10. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Hypa-tius, Prietorian
Prefect.
The privileges attaching to Our private property remaining in full force, all
lands which are rented by perpetual lease shall not be sub-
jected to any extraordinary contributions, nor shall the original rental be
increased, and lessees of this kind are exempt from any general impositions
authorized by Us, and must not be classed with others who, besides their
ordinary burdens, pay Us a certain fixed rent based upon the value of the land
which they occupy.
Published at Carthage, during the Idesof April, after the Consulate of Syagrius
and Eucherius, 382.
11. The Same Emperors to Syagrius, Prsetorian Prefect.
We order that those who, having been invested with the dignity of Count, have,
either by means of letters or petitions, been proposed to Us as eligible to the
appointment of masters, as well as those who have performed their duties to Us
by drafting and signing opinions, shall be exempt from all civil duties.
Therefore, persons who have been attached to Our palace, and are of this rank,
shall receive the privileges to which they are entitled, and those also, who
have attained to higher dignities, shall rejoice in the enjoyment of the same
privileges.
Read at Capua, on the third of the Kalendsof September, during
the Consulate of Antoninus and Syagrius, 382.
12. The Same Emperors to Hypatius, Prsetorian Prefect.
The greatest dignitaries of the State, the Counts of the Consistory, Our
notaries, Our valets de chambre,and the guards of Our bedchamber, shall all be
exempt from ignoble services. Others who enjoy palatine or military privileges
within the precincts of the palace shall, likewise, have the same advantage, if
they can show that they are entitled to an exemption of this kind by former
laws, not as having been granted to them individually, but to have been
conferred upon the whole order or body of which they are members. The same
privilege conceded by ancient custom shall continue to be enjoyed by
rhetoricians and grammarians of both languages.
Exemption from ignoble services signifies that persons of superior rank shall
not be required to grind fine flour, bake bread, or perform any of the duties
of a baker, as well as the labors imposed upon menials having charge of
vehicles or post-horses, with the exception of those which, in accordance with
custom, are performed on the frontier of Rhetia, or which the necessities of
the expedition to Illyria may require.
No services shall be demanded of persons of this kind for the aid of certain
classes of laborers, for instance, in the burning of lime. Nor shall the
estates of those who are exempt be compelled to supply building material of
timber or planks. The furnishing of charcoal, also, except where, in accordance
with ancient custom, it is required for the coining of money, or the
manufacture of arms, shall not be exacted of persons of this description. Nor
shall they be obliged to provide anything for the construction or repair of
public or sacred buildings.
Property protected by such privileges, which belongs to ambassadors and members
of colleges, is not liable to these impositions.
This advantage, however, can only be enjoyed by estates which are considered to
possess the dignity in their own name. By a grant of general privilege We also
exempt from the rendition of ignoble services those who have already been
invested with similar honors.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof December, during the Consulate of Antonius and
Syagrius, 382.
13. The Emperors Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius to Neo-therius,
Prsetorian Prefect.
The exemption from ignoble labors granted to persons cannot pass to their heirs
or successors, for it is not perpetual, and We have conceded it not to things
but to persons, in consideration of their rank or military service.
Given at Milan, on the eighteenth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of
Arcadius and Bauto, 385.
14. The Same Emperors to Tatian, Prsetorian Prefect of the East.
We decree that the law by which certain dignitaries have been expressly
exempted from extraordinary and ignoble services, shall, without doubt, apply
to those who have been honored by Us, so that they may enjoy the same
privilege, not merely while they are in office but as long as they live.
Given at Milan, on the eleventh of the Kalends ofApril, during the Consulate of
Tatian and Symmachus, 391.
15. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Messianus, Count of Private Affairs.
We decree clearly and absolutely that there shall not be imposed upon any land
forming part of Our private domain, which is held under a lease, or by
emphyteusis, any ignoble charge or imposition, under the name of a tax, except
the ordinary ones, for this has been ordered by the Emperors, our predecessors,
and confirmed by Us. Therefore, any judge who violates this law is hereby
notified that he will be compelled to pay a fine of five pounds of gold out of
his own property, and that his subordinates and the decurions who have executed
his illegal commands will be fined an equal sum.
Given at Milan, on the seventeenth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate
of Olybrius and Probinus, 395.
16. The Same Emperors and Theodosius to Melitius, Prsetorian Prefect.
We hereby release all illustrious persons from ignoble services, and the losses
resulting from extraordinary impositions.
Given at Ravenna, on the fifteenth of the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate
of Honorius, Consul for the ninth time, and Theodosius, Consul for- the fifth
time, 412.
TITLE XLVIII.
CONCERNING CHARGES AND SERVICES FROM WHICH No ONE CAN BE EXCUSED.
1. The Emperor Aurelian.
All persons, without exception, are required to sell to the Government any
commodities which they may have, in order to provide for the maintenance and
transport of the armies in Illyria; since, with reference to this matter, We
decree that no one shall be entitled to avail himself of any privilege
whatsoever, but, when circumstances demand it, all will be compelled to
contribute, not only those who are wealthy, but everyone from the highest to
the lowest, in proportion to his possessions, shall be subject to this
obligation.
2. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Taurus, Prsetorian Prefect.
As Our subjects in all the provinces should render Us ordinary service in the
places through which We travel, We order that no one shall be exempt from any
services connected with the furnishing of post-horses, transportation, or
vehicles, which We may require at such times, but that no persons, whether they
are attached to the retinue of the Emperor or the Empress, or to the Holy
Church, or to any other illustrious house, shall be released by any law,
Imperial decree, or rescript; and We order that they must obey any proclamation
of Your Excellency issued during the time of Our journey.
3. The Emperor Leo.
We order, by this most wise law, that no excuse shall avail, and that no
personal rank shall be exempt, but when the construction of walls, the
contribution of grain or any other commodities may be required in any place
subject to your jurisdiction, these shall be furnished without any hesitation,
so far as Your Highness may consider it to be proper and necessary.
TITLE XLIX.
WHO ARE EXCUSED BY REASON OF THEIR AGE OR PROFESSION.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian.
As you allege that you are engaged in liberal studies, and especially such as
have reference to the profession of the law, and are at present residing in the
City of Berytus, in the province of Phoenicia, We, in consideration of the
public welfare and your expectations, hereby decree that neither of you shall
be interfered with while pursuing your studies, until you have reached the age
of twenty-five years.
2. The Same Emperors and Caesars.
As you allege that although your sons have been released from your control they
are still minors, it is with reason that you request
that they should not be molested while pursuing their studies. Hence We direct
that they shall not be liable to personal charges having no connection with
estates in which they are interested, if no lack of other citizens exists.
3. The Same Emperors and Csesars.
It is a clear rule of law that persons more than fifty-five years of age cannot
be compelled to perform personal services. Therefore, as you state that you are
over seventy, if you appealed on account of your appointment, you can, in
accordance with law, be protected by the Governor of the province.
TITLE L. WHO ARE EXCUSED ON ACCOUNT OF DISEASE.
1. The Emperor Gordian.
If your father, having lost his sight in battle, is blind in both eyes, he will
be released from all personal charges.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian.
As you allege that you are deaf, you will be exempt from personal charges by
authority of the public law.
3. The Same Emperors and Csssars.
The gout does not afford a valid excuse from personal services, but as you say
that you are so afflicted with disease in the feet that you cannot attend to
your own affairs, the Governor of the province will not permit you to be
subjected to personal charges, if he should find that your statements are true.
4. The Same Emperors and Ciesars.
The bodily infirmities of a father do not afford a valid excuse for releasing
his son from personal charges.

TITLE LI.
CONCERNING THOSE WHO SHOULD BE EXCUSED ON
ACCOUNT OF THE NUMBER OF THEIR CHILDREN, OR
BY REASON OF THEIR POVERTY.
1. The Emperor Antoninus.
The number of children does not exempt anyone from the burdens of a public
office.
2. The Emperor Philip and the Csesar Philip.
It has already been decided that, where a son has been captured by the enemy
and has not yet returned, this fact cannot be advanced by his father to excuse
him from personal services.
3. The Same Emperors and Caesars.

Grandsons who succeed to their father confer the same benefits as the latter
would have done, and therefore if he who you say is your father has under his
control five grandchildren of sons whom he has lost, he should be excused from
personal services in conformity with the laws.
4. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian.
As you state that you have transferred all your property to your son, and have
retained nothing, you will be required to perform civil services on account of
property which has ceased to belong to you.
5. The Same Emperors and Caesars.
Where women, on account of their sex, are liable to personal services, the
Divine Emperors, Our relatives, have decided that they shall be excused, just
as males are, when they have five surviving children.
6. The Emperor Constantine to Dalmatius.
It is established that parents who have five children of either sex shall be
exempt from personal services, but if among this number a son of lawful age
should be found, he will immediately become subject to the performance of the
services to which his father was liable. The exemption afforded by the laws
shall, however, be granted to fathers who have five sons or daughters. If
anyone should deserve exemption on account of being weak-minded, and this can
be proved, he will enjoy this privilege; just as he could do if, when required
to perform personal services, he had been declared exempt' on account of
poverty.
Given at Sirmium, on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof February, during the
Consulate of Crispus, Consul for the third time, and Constantine, Consul for
the second time, 324.1
TITLE LII. CONCERNING PROFESSORS AND PHYSICIANS.
1. The Emperor Antoninus.
If, as you allege you are serving as the physician of the Second Legion, you
cannot be compelled to perform civil services as long as you are absent on
business for the State. After your connection with
1 The Roman system of taxation was quite complicated, and its exactions at
times somewhat severe. Its most oppressive characteristics were its unequal
distribution and its uncertainty, the levy usually varying according to the
present exigencies of the State, and was, to a great extent, dependent upon the
caprice of the authorities charged with its imposition. The practice of farming
out the collection of taxes was, as is ever the case, a perpetual cause of
corruption and annoyance. No available source of public revenue seems to have
escaped the ingenuity and vigilance of the Roman legislator. Assessments, often
arbitrary, were placed upon conquered nations, lands, personal property,
individuals, incomes, and inheritances. Duties were imposed upon almost all
imports and exports.
The earliest species of tax was the tributum --- so called from the tribus,or
plebeians, who were at first the sole subject of it --- and while, strictly
speaking,
the army has ceased, however(<and you have returned, you will be entitled to
exemption, if you are'included in the number of those physicians to whom this
privilege has been granted.
2. The Emperor Gordian.
It is a well-known fact that grammarians or orators, who have been authorized
by a decree of a curia,can be deprived of their privi-
it was not a land-tax, real property, then almost exclusively in the hands of
the populace, was its foundation, and was principally affected by it. The
patricians subsequently became liable to this enforced and indeterminate
contribution. The tributum,was levied for the maintenance and remuneration of
the army, and for the purposes of national defense, of which the erection and
repair of fortifications constituted an important and essential item. In early
times, the money collected from the taxpayers was refunded to them out of the
proceeds of the sale of the booty obtained in war. The rate of the tributumwas
at first one part in a thousand of the value of the property, which was
afterwards increased to three thousandths.
Although ordinarily uncertain in amount, the term tributumwas also applicable
to the charge on land and the poll-tax, both of which were definite and
established.
The stipendiumwas the contribution exacted from countries reduced to subjection
by the Roman arms, and was payable in cash, or in commodities of every
description. In the early days of the Empire, a systematic valuation of land
and personal property was instituted, with a view to the levy of this tax, a
measure which had not hitherto been adopted, and which greatly facilitated its
distribution and collection. Some provinces were annually assessed a specified
sum; others were only required to contribute a certain percentage of the crops
of land capable of tillage. This want of uniformity was largely due to the
retention of ancient customs observed prior to the Roman domination.
Among the most lucrative sources of national revenue was the portorium,or
harbor-tax, which included levies of both imports and exports, and dated back
to the foundation of the Roman state. Custom-houses were maintained at the
borders of every province, as well as at those of the Empire. Personal effects
for the use of the owner were, with the exception of articles of undoubted
luxury, exempt from import duties. The amount of the latter varied, at
different epochs, from two and a half to twelve and a half percent of the
appraised value of the goods.
All estates estimated at more than 100,000 sesterces(about $300.00$) were taxed
five per cent. Persons, regardless of sex, who owned no land, were, after their
twenty-fifth year, liable to a poll-tax, the amount of which was established by
a decree of the Emperor; males being generally obliged to pay twice as much as
females. Four per cent of the purchase-money of every slave sold was collected,
as well as five per cent of that of everyone manumitted.
The publicani,or farmers of the revenue, were exclusively entrusted with the
collection of certain taxes, which duty was not imposed upon government
officials. They were originally taken from the Equestrian Order, employment of
this kind being considered derogatory to the dignity of a senator, and were
required to give security for the return of the sums due to the government. As
they purchased the right to collect the revenue of entire districts and
provinces, the temptation to abuse their privilege was irresistible, and the
term publicanussoon became synonymous with extortion. Their wealth and
influence were enormous, and the business was so extensive and profitable that
corporations were organized for the purpose of conducting it, which paid almost
incredible dividends to the stockholders. Contracts were awarded by the censors
to the highest bidder at public sale, and ran from one to five years. The
infamous rapacity and heartlessness of these gentry, who had every incentive to
wring the last sestercefrom the unfortunate taxpayer, was proverbial, and is
frequently reprobated by ancient writers: "Ubi publicanus, est ibi aut jus
publicum vannum, aut libertas sociis nulla."(Livy, AnnalesXLV, 18.) --- ED.
lleeggeeby the same curia,,if they do not make themselves useful to their pupils.
3. The Emperor Philip.
Poets do not enjoy any privilege of immunity.
4. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Cazsars.By an address of the
Divine Pius, professors of the liberal studies, but not accountants, are
included among those who are exempt.
5. The Same Emperors and Csesars.
It has been frequently decided that physicians shall not be included among
those not liable to civil duties, against the will of the curia,as immunity
must be granted them by a decree of the decurions.
6. The Emperor Constantine to Volusianus.
We order that physicians, archiatri*grammarians, and other professors of
letters, as well as doctors of the law, together with their wives and children,
and any property which they may possess in their own cities, shall be exempt
from every function, and every kind of service, civil as well as public; and
shall not be required to entertain guests in a province; nor perform any labor;
nor be compelled to appear in court; nor be deprived of their property; nor be
produced before any tribunal; nor suffer any injury; and if anyone should
molest them, he shall be punished as the judge may decide.
We order that rewards and salaries shall be paid to them by which they may the
more readily perfect themselves in their liberal studies and arts above
mentioned.
Published at Sirmium, on the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Crispus
and Constantine, 321.
7. The Emperor Julian.
Masters and doctors of the liberal arts should, first of all, excel in
morality, and next in eloquence. But as I, Myself, cannot be present in the
different cities, I order that anyone who wishes to teach shall not suddenly or
rashly adopt this profession, but must not do so until
1 These were medical practitioners whose superior talents and established
reputation had raised them to a commanding place in their profession. Their
origin dated back to the reign of the Csesars. Much uncertainty exists as to
their prerogatives, but it is known that they exercised supervision and, to
some extent at least, were invested with judicial authority over other
physicians. They were divided into two classes, from one of which were selected
the medical attendants of the imperial family, and to the other were assigned
the care and treatment of the poor. A certain number of the latter, which
varied according to the population and importance of the community, was
allotted to each municipality; the smallest provincial town had five, at Rome
there were sixteen. As they received regular salaries from the government, the
archiatriwere obliged to give their services gratuitously to indigent patients,
but were not prohibited from accepting compensation from persons able to pay.
Their remuneration was, as a rule, greater than that of the Court physicians,
whose exalted rank and special privileges were presumed to make up for any
deficiency of fees. --- ED.
he has been accepted by the Order of Decurions, and formally authorized by them
under a decree, with the consent of the principal citizens of the community.
Given on the fifth of the Kalendsof July, and adopted at Spoletium, on the
fourth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of Ma-mertinus and
Nevitta, 362.
8. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Probus, Prastorian Prefect.
Every person who is known to have improperly and insolently adopted the
profession of philosopher shall be sent back to his country, with the exception
of those who, having been approved by the principal citizens of the town,
should be separated from the above-mentioned class. For it is shameful that he
who professes to be able to endure the reverses of fortune can not discharge
the duties which he owes to his country.
Given at Sirmium, on the fourteenth of the Kalendsof February, during the
Consulate of Valentinian and Victor, 370.
9. The Same Emperors to Prsetextatus, Prefect of the City.
The attention of archiatersis called to the fact that, when contributions are
made to them by the people, it is more honorable to aid the poor rather than to
basely minister to the rich. We permit them to receive only what those whom
they have cured offer for their services, and not what the latter, when in
danger, may have promised for restitution to health.
Given on the third of the Kalendsof February, during the third Consulate of
Valentinian and Valens, 370.
10. The Same Emperors to Olybrius, Prsetorian Prefect.
When any physician, who is deserving of promotion, is a candidate for the place
of a deceased archmter,he shall not obtain it before he is pronounced to be
qualified by seven or more of the principal practitioners to be found in the
profession; and, moreover, anyone who is admitted shall not at once be placed
in the first rank, but shall take his turn and be the last in order, following
those who have preceded him.
Given on the sixth of the Idesof March, during the third Consulate of
Valentinian and Valens, 370.
11. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Monachius, Prse-torian Prefect.
We order that grammarians, orators, and teachers of philosophy, as well as
physicians, who, by the authority of previous laws which have been enacted,
have obtained privileges and immunities, shall enjoy these privileges; and that
all the physicians attached to the Imperial palace, whether they have attained
to the rank of count of the first or second grade, or some more exalted
dignity, shall not be molested by the officers of any municipality, or
decurionate, whether they
have ceased to perform, or have just begun to perform their functions, if they
have obtained an honorable discharge; and they shall be exempt from all public
employments and duties, hence their families, wherever situated, shall not be
compelled to entertain either sdldiers
or judges.
We order that these rules shall apply, without exception, to their children and
their wives. We also direct that the professors above mentioned, as well as
their children, shall enjoy the same immunity.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Kalendsof December, during the
Consulate of Constantius and Constans, 374.
TITLE LIII. CONCERNING ATHLETES.
1. The Emperor Alexander.
It is the custom to exempt from civil duties those athletes who are proved to
have won not less than three crowns in formal contests during their entire
lives (one of which must have been obtained at Rome, or in ancient Greece), and
who have not been defeated, and deprived of their crowns by their competitors.
TITLE LIV.
CONCERNING THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN DISCHARGED FROM THE ARMY BEFORE COMPLETING THEIR
TERM OF SERVICE.
1. The Emperor Antoninus.
Soldiers who have been dishonorably discharged must not become candidates for
honorable office, but should not be excluded from the discharge of civil
duties.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian.
As you have been dismissed from the army on account of your advanced age, there
.can be no doubt that your discharge was honorable, and therefore you will be
exempt from civil duties, but not from honorable dignities. Still, the law
permits you to avail yourself of those privileges to which all are entitled who
have completed their full term of military service, for you yourself
acknowledge that you were discharged before having served the time prescribed
by law.
3. The Same Emperors and Csesars.
Exemption from personal burdens and services is only granted to veterans where
they are proved to have served twenty years in the army, either in a legion
itself, or as members of a color-guard, and can show that they have obtained an
honorable discharge for full service, or one to ill-health. Therefore, as you
state that you have only Served in a cohort, you will understand that you have
no ground for claiming exemption from civil duties.
FROM WHAT CIVIL SERVICES THOSE ARE EXEMPT WHO, , AFTER HAVING COMPLETED THEIR
TIME IN THE ARMY, OR THE DUTIES TO WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED IN THE
PROVINCES, ENGAGE IN THEIR OWN AFFAIRS AND BUSINESS AT HOME, AND THEIR
PRIVILEGES, AND CONCERNING FARMERS OF THE REVENUE.
1. This Law is not Authentic.
2. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars.
It is certain that no others are exempt from civil duties and dignities than
those who have leased the collection of taxes from the Treasury in their own
names; and therefore no legal doubt can be entertained that persons who have
been appointed by them as their deputies are not entitled to claim this
privilege.
TITLE LVI. CONCERNING FREEDMEN.
1. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars.The status of freedman
does not afford exemption from civil duties, even in the city where the
freedman has his domicile.
TITLE LVII.
CONCERNING INFAMOUS PERSONS. 1. The Emperor Antoninus.
Although infamous persons cannot be promoted to dignities which are only
conferred upon those of honorable reputation, they are, nevertheless, not
exempt from the performance of civil duties, or of those of the decurionate,
but are required to make contributions demanded by the public welfare.
TITLE LVIII.
CONCERNING PERSONS ACCUSED OF CRIME. 1. The Emperor Alexander.
It has often been stated in rescripts by My ancestors, the Emperors, that
persons accused of crime cannot be raised to any new dignities before having
established their innocence.
TITLE LIX. CONCERNING THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN CONDEMNED TO
EXILE, OR SUSPENDED FROM THEIR ORDER. 1. The Emperor Marcus Antoninus to
Diogenes.Decurions who have been suspended from their order for a certain time
cease to be infamous after that time has expired.
2. The Emperor Gordian.
A decurion who has been sentenced to exile for a specified term, and returns
after it has expired, will recover his former rank, but cannot be promoted to
new honors, until as much time has elapsed as passed while he was absent in
flight.
TITLE LX.
CONCERNING SONS UNDER PATERNAL CONTROL, AND TO WHAT EXTENT THEIR FATHER Is
RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM.
1. The Emperors Severus and Antoninus.
It is a perfectly clear rule of law that a father is not responsible for his
emancipated son, even if he has given his consent for him to be made a
decurion, for where he has agreed to this, he will only be liable if his son is
under his control. He, however, is considered to have consented, if he did not
show any opposition to his appointment.
2. The Emperor Antoninus.
As you state that you have appealed, you must prove that your individual
interests are involved, for you can only oppose the appointment of your son,
and cannot consent that the responsibilities of the office shall be imposed
upon you.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian, and the Csesars.
If those called by their father to perform the duties of the pro-tostasiatare
still under paternal control, they will be released from the duties of the
office, for it would appear extremely unjust if two persons belonging to the
same family should be compelled, under such circumstances, to perform these
duties. But you should, without hesitation, retain those sons who it is evident
have been emancipated, and have left their father's family.
4. The Same Emperors and Csesars.
The magistrate appointed your son a curator, without your incurring any
responsibility, and it will not be necessary for you to appeal; for he, without
your consent, nominated your son, who was under your control, and he will be
responsible for any loss which may result from the administration of the
office, unless your son had previously been appointed decurion with your
acquiescence.
TITLE LXI.
CONCERNING THE RESPONSIBILITY OF A PARENT FOR His
HEIRS.
1. The Emperor Alexander.
If your father became responsible, and rendered his own property liable because
of your appointment to the office of priest, the Governor of the province will
not be ignorant of the fact that liability for the expenses incurred will pass
to all his heirs.
TTIITTLLEE LLXXIIII..
CONCERNING WOMEN AND WHERE THEY MAY BECOME
RESPONSIBLE FOR MUNICIPAL SERVICES IMPOSED UPON
OFFICES AND HONORS SUITABLE TO THEIR SEX.
1. The Emperor Philip.
It has frequently been stated in rescripts that where a woman was born in one
place and married in another, and her husband does not reside in the City of
Rome, she can be compelled to accept honors and offices which are personal, and
those of her sex are capable of receiving, not in the city of her birth but
where her husband resides. Women, however, must be responsible for charges
attaching to estates in the places where those estates are situated.
TTIITTLLEE LLXXIIIIII..
CONCERNING EMBASSIES.
1. The Emperors Valerian and Gallienus.
The father of three living children is exempt from public embassies.
2. The Same Emperors and Csesars to Valerian.
After having received a certain sum of money in your own name for the public
defence, that which your colleague received for his expenses his heirs will not
be compelled to turn over to you, if it was intended for the same purpose, but
if it should be absolutely necessary for it to be refunded, it must be given to
the government. Where the amount was intended for the compensation of
advocates, you, whose duty it is to pay them, can very properly demand to be
reimbursed. Moreover, you can prosecute your colleague for having neglected his
duty, as you allege that he desisted from the defence of his country, for which
he was appointed.
3. The Emperors Diocletian and Maximian.
It has been decided that those who have been appointed to an embassy to Us,
from across the sea, are entitled to exemption from civil services and offices
for the term of two years, but not those who have discharged their duties to
the State from a place near at hand.
4. The Emperor Constantine.
All counts of Governors who have obtained their dignities by suffrage shall be
required to discharge civil duties, lest the public welfare may be injured
through an agreement made with reference to services which had not been
performed. Those, however, who are employed in public embassies, shall be
exempt from the aforesaid burdens.
5. The Emperors Theodosius, Arcadius, and Honorius, to Apode-mius, Prsetorian
Prefect of Illyria.

whatever should be submitted to the consideration of all, or a majority of the
authorities, shall not be brought before an ordinary judge for examination. We
permit you to take cognizance of, and investigate the claims of inhabitants of
the provinces, by whom this is frequently required in the case of unforeseen
events, so that you may inquire into any matters which demand your immediate
attention, and which ought to be brought to Our notice. Any decision, however,
with reference to the general welfare of the people of the province, must be
rendered in a public place, and that which has obtained the approval of a
majority shall be formally confirmed.
Given at Constantinople, on the fifth of the Kalendsof August, during the
Consulate of Arcadius, Consul for the second time, and Rufinus, 392.
6. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Monaxius, Prse-torian Prefect.
Whenever an embassy is sent to Us from the City of Alexandria, We order all the
decurions of the city, if they are not prevented by ill-,ness, or for some
other good reason, to assemble in their accustomed place, and having signed a
decree to communicate it to the illustrious Augustal Prefect, so that, by his
intervention, the demands may be brought to your notice, and the object of the
embassy be determined by your examination.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Nonesof October, during the
Consulate of Our Lord the Emperor Theodosius, Consul for the seventh time, and
Palladius, 416.

TITLE LXIV.
CONCERNING THE EXCUSES OF ARTISANS.
1. The Emperor Constantine to Maximus.
We order that artisans engaged in the trades hereinafter specified, and who
reside in different cities, shall be exempt from all civil duties, above all,
if their leisure is employed in perfecting themselves in occupations by which
they may become more skillful, and their sons be instructed. This enumeration
is as follows: Architects, physicians, painters, sculptors, workers in marble,
manufacturers of beds or chests, locksmiths, chariot-makers, builders, that is
to say masons, woodcarvers, musiarii,gilders, workers in stucco, silversmiths,
bar-baricarii, diatretarii,brokers, founders, signarii,manufacturers,
brochiarii,engineers, potters, who in Greek are called x<romaTa> goldsmiths,
glaziers, workers in lead, makers of mirrors, workers in ivory, furriers,
fullers, carpenters, plasterers, dealbatares, cusores, trigarii, cisarii,and
bractearii.1

2. The Emperors Constantine and Constans to Leontius, Praetorian Prefect.
We require surveyors, geometers, and architects who are occupied in dividing
land and other property, and whose duty it is to take measurements, and
establish boundaries, as well as those whose business it is to conduct or
remove water, to likewise employ their spare time for the purpose of teaching
others, and extending their own knowledge. Hence they shall enjoy immunity from
civil services and must take a certain number of pupils for the purpose of
giving them instruction.
Given on the day before the Nonesof July, during the Consulate of Leontius and
Sallust, 344.
TITLE LXV.
CONCERNING THE QUALIFICATIONS OF PERSONS APPOINTED
TO OFFICE.
1. The Emperor Antoninus.
If, having been called to perform civil duties, you should think that someone
else is better qualified, you can make a statement to that effect.
TITLE LXVI.
WHERE AN APPOINTMENT Is MADE THROUGH ENMITY.
1. The Emperor Alexander.
If you have been appointed to a civil office on account of enmity entertained
toward you, the justice of the Governor will prevent this appointment from
being a source of injury to you; for it is not advantageous to the State for
appointments to be made through enmity, as this should be done because of
proper qualifications, and with a view to the public welfare.
TITLE LXVII. CONCERNING THE RECOVERY OF EXPENSES.
1. The Emperor Gordian.
'You will not be required to perform the civil duties imposed upon persons, if
you have five living children. If, however, in violation of this privilege, you
should be called upon to perform the duties of public office, after having
taken an appeal, you should state your right to exemption, and you can recover
from those who appointed you the expenses which you have incurred in
litigation.
TITLE LXVIII. WHERE ANYONE DIES AFTER His APPOINTMENT.
1. The Emperor Alexander.
If your father died before enjoying his dignity, or performing the duties of
his office, the Governor of the province can entertain no doubt that his heirs
cannot be held liable on his account.
TITLE LXIX.
CONCERNING BOOKKEEPERS, SECRETARIES, WRITERS OF SPEECHES, AND REGISTERS OF THE
CENSUS.
1. The Emperor Alexander.
No bookkeeper, scribe, writer of speeches, or their sons, shall discharge the
duties of any other office, and if they should do so, they shall immediately be
returned to their municipal employments, even if they are serving in Our
palace, provided that they are discovered within the term of five years.
Given on the eighth of the Kalendsof July, during the Consulate of Marcellinus
and Probinus, 341.
2. The Emperor Gordian.
Any decurion who voluntarily assumes employment in the administration of the
census shall have the place which he himself has chosen; and if it should be
found necessary to subject him to torture, he cannot plead the dignity of his
order by way of exemption.
3. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Hadrian, Prsetorian Prefect.
By this general law, We order that whenever it becomes necessary to appoint
keepers of the archives for entire provinces, or for single cities, freemen
shall be selected, nor can this office hereafter be filled by anyone of servile
condition. If, however, a master should permit his slave or serf to have charge
of public documents (and this must be done with his consent and knowledge), he
will be liable for any loss or damage occasioned by said slave or serf, in
matters connected with the public welfare, and the slave, after having been
scourged, shall be confiscated to the Treasury. Hence it will be to the
interest of masters, in the beginning, to see that their slaves do not concern
themselves with public transactions.
Given at Milan, on the eighth of the Kalendsof April, during the Consulate of
Vicentius and Fabricius, 401.
4. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian.
Philosophers, accountants, writers of speeches, medogrammatici, diastolei(which
designations show that they are employed in the public service), or no matter
under what other names they may pass, when they cannot plead any honor or other
privilege by way of exemption, shall, by the provisions of the laws, inexorably
be compelled to discharge the duties required by their station, so that the
general welfare may not suffer or be injured by their failure to do so, and
they shall be obliged to perform those personal services to which their fathers
or ancestors were liable.
TITLE LXX.
CONCERNING RECEIVERS, SUPERINTENDENTS AND TREASURERS.
1. The Emperor Antoninus.
We decree that public receivers of money should not delay their collections, so
that.no one may be obliged to incur expense on this account. For when anyone
desiring to make payment is repulsed by the receiver, he ought to produce
witnesses to prove the refusal, and, this having been done, he shall be
released from liability for payment, and he who refused to receive the money
shall be compelled by the Governor to pay to the Treasury double the amount
due.
If receivers should violate this law through the neglect of a judge who has
jurisdiction of the case, the latter shall make good the amount out of his own
property.
2. The Emperor Alexander.
Magistrates who appoint receivers and officials having the care of public
warehouses and districts shall, under laws long in operation, be held
responsible for their appointees, if the latter should prove insolvent, as well
as be liable for any property which may fraudulently be lost through sales to
persons who have been introduced for that purpose.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Kalendsof August, during the
Consulate of Valentinian and Valens, 365.
3. The Emperors Valentinian and Valens to Mamertinus, Praetorian Prefect.
Receivers of public moneys are hereby notified to collect not only what is due
for the present year, but also any unpaid sums for other years which have
already expired.
Given at Rome, on the day before the Kalendsof November, during the Consulate
of Valentinian and Valens, 365.
4. The Same Emperors to Florentius, Count of the Sacred Largesses.
No one who has completed his term of his office as public receiver shall be
continued in the discharge of the same duties, unless he has first released
himself from liability by rendering an account of his former administration;
for it is unjust to hold those responsible who have performed their duty
properly, and it is not wise not to call those to account who have failed to
perform it. Therefore, after the expiration of a year, they shall be compelled
to show what disposition they have made of what they have collected, so that if
any of them should be found guilty of theft, he can the more readily be
compelled to make good the loss.
Nor should collectors have the power to constantly molest the people of the
provinces, as, for instance, by the practice of extortion, but they should be
changed every year, unless either the custom of the
city, or the rules of their order, require them to remain for the term of two
years.
Given at Constantinople, on the day before the Kalendsof December, during the
Consulate of Our Prince Honorius and Evodius, 386.
5. The Same Emperor.
Whenever a certain sum of solidiis due, and an amount of gold or silver in bulk
is tendered instead, it shall be accepted at the rate of seventy-two solidito
the pound.
Given at Rome, on the sixth of the Idesof January, during the Consulate of
Lupicinus and Jovinus, 367.
6. The Emperors Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian to Chilo.
A record must be made of all grain stored in the public warehouses, and a
receipt immediately given therefor, but only that belonging to the Treasury
shall be placed in the Treasury warehouses.
Given on the fifth of the Idesof April, after the Consulate of Gratian, Consul
for the third time, and Equitius, 374.
7. The Emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius to Hyptu-tius.
Collections shall not remain a long time in the hands of the receivers, but
shall immediately after being 'obtained from the inhabitants of provinces be
deposited in the Imperial Treasury.
Given at Constantinople, on the third of the Kalendsof May, after the Consulate
of Antonius and Syagrius, 383.
8. The Same Emperors to Cynegius, Prsstorian Prefect.
Public collectors and receivers shall be appointed at a full meeting of the
decurionate, with the consent and approbation of all or a majority of those
present, and Governors of provinces shall scrutinize the names of those who
have been selected and charged with the performance of official duties, and
always bear in mind that they will be responsible for all the acts of the
administration of those whom they appoint.
Given at Constantinople, on the sixth of the Kalendsof November, during the
Consulate of Our Prince Honorius, and Evodius, 386.
9. The Emperors Valentinian and Arcadius to Cynegius, Prsstorian Prefect.
We order that brazen or stone weights and measures shall be placed at each
public station and city, so that everyone who pays tribute will have under his
eyes the regular standards prescribed for all commodities, and ascertain what
he is obliged to give to the receivers; so that if any of the latter should
exceed the regular measure or weight, he may know that he will undergo the
penalty prescribed for his offence, and having abolished everything which has
heretofore been enacted contrary to the welfare of the people, We hereby decree
that fifty measures of wheat, forty of barley, and twenty of wine and bacon
shall be delivered to the receivers.
Moreover, being induced by motives of humanity, We order that, on account of
the distance, forty measures of corn and barley, and fifteen of wine and bacon
shall be delivered to the receivers in the province of Armenia.
Given at Constantinople, on the fourth of the Kalendsof December, during the
Consulate of Our Prince Honorius, and Evodius, 386.
10. The Same Emperors to Cynegius, Pf&torian Prefect.
The receiver shall draw up and state in the presence of the defenders of the
city the amount of the contribution to be paid by the possessors of land, as
well as the different kinds of commodities, and the number and quantity of
each.
Given at Constantinople, on the fourth of the Kalendsof December, during the
Consulate of Timasius and Promotus, 389.
11. The Emperors Arcadius and Honorius to Benignus, Vicegerent of the City of
Rome.
We desire the receivers of wine to be responsible for the amount receipted for
to the tributaries. The receipts must be produced in public, and, in order that
their genuineness may be established, an account of them must be rendered by
those who gave them.
Given at Milan, on the sixth of the Idesof June, during the Consulate of
Stilicho and Aurelian, 400.
12. The Same Emperors to their Friend, Pompeianus, Greeting:If the owner of
property should detect a receiver or an accountant in the commission of fraud,
he who has been convicted shall not again hold the office during the
administration of which he was guilty of dishonesty, even though he may, by
clandestine means, have obtained an Imperial Rescript authorizing him to do so.
Given at Milan, on the day before the Kalendsof January, during the Consulate

13. The Same Emperors to Lucius, Count of the Sacred Largesses.
We order that two registrars or accountants, and the same number of receivers,
be appointed in every province. We desire, moreover, to give notice to the
Prsetorian Prefect that those who make collections for the Imperial Largesses
have nothing in common with the officials charged with the accounts of the
Treasury of the Prefecture, and provincial judges shall be fined five pounds of
gold, and their chief subordinates be punished with death, if this law is not
observed.

14. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to their friend, Eu-chwrius, Greeting:
In order that the public welfare may not suffer, We do not permit decurions to
fill inferior offices, or be subject to extraordinary burdens. Therefore it is
better for the receiver of clothing to be appointed from among the officers of
the Proconsul, or from among those who have
already exercised the same employment. Still, it is important to be careful in
this matter, and to examine the qualifications of candidates so as to select
persons best qualified for the place; for it is inequitable for all the
benefits to belong to the officials above mentioned, and for the decurionate
alone to bear the loss of collection. Hence, We exempt all members of the
decurionate from this injustice, with the exception of those who have either
held the above-mentioned office, or are administering it at present.
Given at Ravenna, on the day before the Kalendsof March, during the Consulate
of Honorius, Consul for the ninth time, and Theodosius, Consul for the fifth
time, 412.
15. The Emperors Theodosius and Valentinian to Volusianus, Prse-torian Prefect.
The treasurer or the collector shall receive any gold and silver offered by a

subordinates that they will be responsible, if any injustice is sustained by
the tributaries through incorrect weights; and We order that whatever is
collected in the provinces for the benefit of Our Treasury shall be delivered
to the illustrious Count of the Treasury.
Given at Ravenna, on the third of the Kalendsof March, after the Consulate of

2. The Emperor Justinian to Mamertinus, Prsetorian Prefect.
It is settled that when any doubt arises with reference to the purity of the

Greek, who is appointed in each city, and who shall render his decision to the
best of his ability and information.
Given on the ninth of the Kalendsof May, during the Consulate of Julian, Consul

TITLE LXXII. CONCERNING THE COLLECTORS OF PUBLIC MONEY.
1. The Emperors Honorius and Theodosius to Anthemius, Praetorian Prefect.
Some collectors of public money presume to make their collections Withoufhaving
previously obtained authority to do so (as is customary)
and others retain for a long time what should have been immediately turned over
to the Treasury. Therefore, We decree that no one shall collect any money
without having previously been authorized by the Count of the Sacred Largesses,
or shall retain it, after having once collected it.
Given on the thirteenth of the Kalendsof August, during the Consulate of
Honorius, Consul for the eighth time, and Theodosius, Consul for the third
